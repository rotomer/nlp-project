Item 1.01
                                            
.
 
On February 2, 2005, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Valero Energy Corporation (the "Company") approved certain compensation arrangements for each of the Company's "named executive officers" (as defined in Item 402(a)(3) of Regulation S-K).  On February 3, 2005, the independent directors of the Board ratified and approved the compensation arrangements payable to the Company's Chief Executive Officer.  In addition, a new non-employee director was elected to the Board on February 3, 2005, thus allowing the director to participate in the Company's compensation arrangements for non-employee directors.  These compensation arrangements are described below.
 
.  The Committee (and the independent directors of the Board with respect to the CEO) approved incentive bonus awards for 2004 for each of the Company's named executive officers pursuant to the terms of the Valero Energy Corporation Annual Bonus Plan (the "Bonus Plan").  To calculate bonus amounts for 2004, the Committee started with the target percentage of base salary for each executive, and then adjusted the target upward or downward depending on the Company's level of achievement with respect to certain financial performance goals.  In addition, the Committee could further adjust bonus awards upward or downward by up to 25 percent, based upon such individual factors as the Committee deemed appropriate.  The following three quantitative measures of financial performance were used to determine incentive bonuses for 2004; the performance factors were given equal weight in determining potential adjustments to target percentages of base salary:
Incentive Bonus
 
return on investment ("ROI") of the Company compared with the average ROI for its peer group for the 12-month period ended September 30, 2004;
 - 
                                         
earnings per share ("EPS") of the Company compared to a target EPS approved in advance by the Compensation Committee; and
 - 
                                         
total shareholder return ("TSR") of the Company compared to a target TSR approved in advance by the Committee (TSR measures the growth in the daily average closing price per share of the Company's Common Stock during the month of November, including the reinvestment of dividends, compared with the daily average closing price of the Company's Common Stock during the corresponding period in the prior year).
 - 
                                         
 
The 2004 incentive bonuses were payable in cash, but participants could elect to use 25 percent of their bonus award to purchase, at fair market value, shares of Common Stock.
 
.  The Committee (and the independent directors of the Board with respect to the CEO) approved awards of performance shares for each of the Company's named executive officers pursuant to the terms of the Company's 2001 Executive Stock Incentive Plan (the "2001 ESIP").  The performance shares are payable in shares of the Company's common stock, $.01 par value ("Common Stock").  The performance shares vest annually in one-third increments beginning on the first anniversary of their grant date.  Upon vesting, the performance shares are converted into a number of shares of Common Stock based upon the Company's total shareholder return during rolling three-year periods that end on December 31 of each year following the date of grant.  At the end of each performance period, the Company's total
Performance Share Awards
shareholder return is compared to its peer group and is ranked by quartile.  Holders of the performance shares then earn 0 percent, 50 percent, 100 percent or 150 percent of that portion of the initial grant that is vesting, depending upon whether the Company's total shareholder return is in the last, third, second or first quartile, respectively; holders earn 200 percent if the Company is the highest ranking entity in the peer group.
 
.  On February 3, 2005, Donald L. Nickles was elected to the Board.  Accordingly, he is eligible to receive equity compensation grants from the Company pursuant to the terms of the Company's (i) Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors ("NED RS Plan"), and (ii) Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan ("NED SO Plan").  In addition, he is entitled to the non-employee director fees generally payable to the Company's non-employee directors.  The foregoing compensation arrangements are further described on pages 6 and 7 of the Company's proxy statement for the 2004 annual meeting of stockholders (file no. 1-13175, filed March 26, 2004) under the caption "Compensation of Directors," and that information is hereby incorporated by reference into this Current Report.
Compensation Arrangements for New Non-Employee Director
 
.  The forms of agreements filed as exhibits to this Current Report  together with the 2001 ESIP, the Bonus Plan, the NED RS Plan, the NED SO Plan and the disclosures stated above  contain the material terms and conditions for participation in the compensation arrangements described in this Item.  In reliance on Instruction 1 to Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K, the Company is not filing each individual's personal arrangement under the plans.

In the event that the membership of the Compensation Committee shall fail to meet the foregoing criteria, then additional or different members of the Board of Directors shall be appointed by the Board to act for purposes of administering this Plan so that the committee administering this Plan shall consist solely of two or more "Non-Employee Directors."  Subject to the terms of the Plan and applicable law, and in addition to other express powers and authorizations conferred on the Committee by the Plan, the Committee shall have authority to:

(j)
               
 
SECTION 4.  Shares and Other Property Available For Awards.

Shares Available
 
.  Any Shares delivered pursuant to an Award may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued Shares or treasury Shares.
(b)
              
Sources of Shares Deliverable Under Awards
 
.  (i)  If all or any portion of an Award vests or is exercised subsequent to any stock dividend, rights distribution, split-up, recapitalization, combination or exchange of shares, merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, spin-off or separation, reorganization, liquidation or other similar event (any one of which being hereafter referred to as a AReorganization Event@), as a result of which shares or other securities of any class or rights shall be issued in respect of outstanding Shares, or Shares shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of the same or another class or classes or other securities, the person exercising or otherwise entitled to such Award shall receive, except as may be otherwise determined by the Committee:
(c)
              
Adjustments
 
for the aggregate price payable upon such exercise of an Option, or upon vesting of an Award (other than an Option) denominated in Shares (1) the aggregate number and class of shares, rights or other securities for which a recognized market exists, and (2) a cash amount equal to the fair market value (as reasonably determined by the Committee) on such exercise or vesting date of any other property (other than regular cash dividend payments) and of any shares, rights or other securities for
(A)
             
which no recognized market exists, which, if Shares (as authorized at the date of the granting of such Award) had been acquired at the date of granting of the Award for the same aggregate price (on the basis of the price per share, if any, provided in the Award) and had not been disposed of, such person or persons would be holding at the time of such exercise or vesting as a result of such acquisition and any such Reorganization Event, and
 
a cash amount upon the exercise of any SARs equal to the difference between the aggregate grant price of such SARs and the aggregate of (1) the fair market value, on the exercise date of any whole shares, rights or other securities for which a recognized market exists, and (2) the fair market value (as reasonably determined by the Committee) on such date of any other property (other than regular cash dividend payments) which the holder of a number of Shares equal to the number of such SARs, if such Shares had been purchased at the date of granting of such SARs and not otherwise disposed of, would be holding at the time of exercise of such SARs as a result of such purchase and any such Reorganization Event;
(B)
              
 
, that no fractional Share, fractional right or other fractional security shall be issued upon any such exercise or vesting, and the aggregate price paid shall be appropriately reduced to reflect any fractional Share, fractional right or other fractional security not issued; and , that if the exercise or vesting of any Award subsequent to any Reorganization Event would, pursuant to clause (A) of this Section 4(c)(i), require the delivery of shares, rights or other securities which the Company is not then authorized to issue or which in the sole judgment of the Committee cannot be issued without undue effort or expense, the person exercising or vesting in such Award shall receive, in lieu of such shares, rights or other securities, a cash payment equal to the Fair Market Value on the exercise or vesting date, as the case may be, as reasonably determined by the Committee, of such shares, rights or other securities.  For purposes of applying the provisions of this Plan, the Preference Share Purchase Rights distributed to stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Rights Agreement shall be deemed not to have been distributed until the Distribution Date (as defined in the Rights Agreement).
provided, however
provided further, however
 
In the event of any change in the number of Shares outstanding resulting from a Reorganization Event, the aggregate number and class of Shares remaining available to be awarded under this Plan shall be that number and class which a person, to whom an Award had been granted for all of the available Shares under this Plan on the date preceding such change, would be entitled to receive as provided in Section 4(c)(i).
(ii)
          
 
Upon the occurrence of any Reorganization Event, the Committee shall be entitled (but shall not be required) to determine that new Award Agreements shall be entered into with Participants reflecting such event.
(iii)
         
 
.  For purposes of determining at any time the number of Shares that remain available for grant under this Plan, the number of Shares then authorized pursuant to
(d)
              
Share Counting
Section 4 of the Plan shall be (i) decreased by the "gross" number of Shares issued pursuant to exercised Awards, (ii) decreased by the "gross" number of Shares issuable pursuant to outstanding unexercised Awards, and (iii) increased by the number of Shares to which a Participant shall have forfeited, voluntarily surrendered or otherwise permanently lost his or her right to exercise or vest in an Award under any provision of this Plan or otherwise.  As used herein, the "gross" number of Shares refers to the maximum number of Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of an Award. Should the exercise price of an Award under the Plan be paid with shares of Common Stock or should shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable under the Plan be withheld by the Company in satisfaction of the withholding taxes incurred in connection with the exercise or vesting of an Award, then the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced by the gross number of Shares for which the Award is exercised or which vest under the stock issuance, and not by the net number of Shares of Common Stock issued to the holder of such option.  The provisions above shall be applied in a manner which will permit compensation generated under the Plan which is intended to constitute "performance-based" compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code to be treated as such "performance-based" compensation.
 
SECTION 5.  Eligibility.
 
Any Employee who is (a) not a member of the Committee, and either (b) an executive officer of the Company or an executive officer of a subsidiary of the Company, or (c) a key employee of the Company or of a subsidiary of the Company designated as such by the Committee, shall be eligible to be designated a Participant by the Committee.

(c)

  Unless otherwise prescribed by the Committee, Awards may be exercised only by written notice of exercise (the "Exercise Notice"), in the form prescribed by the Committee, delivered to the Company to the Financial Benefit Plan Administration Manager or other Company official administering the Plan, and signed by the Participant or the representative or transferee thereof.  The date on which the Exercise Notice is delivered to the Company shall be the "Notice Date."  The Exercise Notice shall specify a date (the "Settlement Date"), not less than five business days nor more than ten business days following the Notice Date, upon which the Shares or other rights shall be issued or transferred to the Participant (or other person entitled to exercise the Award) and the Award's exercise price shall be paid to the Company.
(i)
           
.
Notice
 
.  Unless otherwise prescribed by the Committee, on the Settlement Date, the person exercising an Award shall tender to the Company full payment for the Shares or other rights with respect to which the Award is exercised, together with an additional amount equal to the amount of any taxes required to be collected or withheld by the Company in connection with the exercise of the Award (the "Tax Payment").
(ii)
          
Payment
 
.  Subject to the approval of the Committee, and to any rules and limitations as the Committee may adopt, a person exercising an Award may make the Tax Payment in whole or in part by electing, at or before the time of exercise of the Award, either (A) to have the Company withhold from the number of Shares otherwise deliverable a number of Shares whose value equals the Tax Payment, or (B) to deliver certificates for other Shares owned by the person exercising the Award, endorsed in blank with appropriate signature guarantee, having a value equal to the amount otherwise to be collected or withheld.  Following any election to withhold Shares or deliver other Shares to make a Tax Payment, the Committee shall have sole discretion to approve or disapprove the election at any time prior to the Settlement Date.  If the election is disapproved, the Tax Payment shall be made in cash, or in any combination of cash and Shares as the Committee may direct.  If the Committee shall fail to disapprove the election prior to the Settlement Date, the election will be deemed approved.
(iii)
         
Tax Payment Election
.  Subject to approval by the Committee, a person exercising an Award for the receipt of Shares may pay for the Shares by tendering to the Company other Shares legally and beneficially owned by that person at the time of the exercise of the Award. If approved by the Committee, this method of exercise may include use of a procedure whereby a person exercising an Award may request that Shares received upon exercise of a portion of an Award be automatically applied to satisfy the exercise price for additional and increasingly larger portions of the Award.  The certificate(s) representing any Shares tendered in payment of an Award's exercise price must be accompanied by a stock power duly executed with appropriate signature guarantees.  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, refuse any tender of Shares in which case the Company shall promptly redeliver the Shares to the person exercising the Award and notify the person of the refusal as soon as practicable.  In this event, the person may either (A) tender to the Company on the Settlement Date the cash amount required to pay for the Award's Shares, or (B) rescind the Exercise Notice.  If the person elects to rescind his or her Exercise Notice, the person may again (subject to the other terms of this Plan) deliver an Exercise Notice with respect to the Award at any time prior to its expiration date.
(iv)
         
Payment with Stock
 
.  Any calculation with respect to a Participant's income, required tax withholding or other matters required to be made by the Company upon the exercise of an Award shall be made using the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the Notice Date, whether or not the Exercise Notice is delivered to the Company before or after the close of trading on that date, unless otherwise specified by the Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Option exercises using the Company's or a Participant's taxable gain and related tax withholding on the exercise will be calculated using the actual market price at which Shares were sold in the transaction.

. Except as provided in Section 6(c) of this Plan, until the issuance of the stock certificate(s) for Shares purchased hereunder (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or any authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder of the Company shall exist with respect to such Shares, notwithstanding the exercise of any Award.  No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date the stock certificates evidencing such Shares are issued, except as otherwise provided in this Plan.

Without prior written approval from the Committee, no Award, and no right under any Award, may be assigned, pledged, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by a Participant otherwise than as provided in this Section and any purported assignment, pledge, sale, transfer or encumbrance shall be void and unenforceable against the Company or any Affiliate.
(iii)

Termination of Employment
 
Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, or otherwise determined by the Committee and included in the applicable Award Agreement, an Option, SAR or Other Stock Based Award having an exercise provision (each an "Exercisable Award") vests to and/or may be exercised by a Participant only while the Participant is and has continually been since the date of the grant of the Exercisable Award an Employee.  If a Participant's employment with the Company is voluntarily terminated by the Participant (other than through retirement, death or disability; see sub-Section (C) below), or is terminated by the Company for Cause, then any Exercisable Award previously granted to that Participant under the Plan which remains unexercised, whether vested or unvested, shall automatically lapse and be forfeited at the close of business on the date of the Participant's termination of employment.  If a Participant's employment is involuntarily terminated by the Company other than for Cause, (1) that portion of any Exercisable Award which has not vested on or prior to such date of termination shall automatically lapse and be forfeited, and (2) all vested but unexercised Exercisable Awards previously granted to that Participant under the Plan shall automatically lapse and be forfeited at the close of business on the last business day of the twelfth month following the date of Participant's termination (or, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option Award, 12 months after the Participant's termination by reason of death or disability, or 3 months after any other termination), unless an Exercisable Award sooner expires according to its original terms.
(A)
         
 
Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, or otherwise determined by the Committee and included in the applicable Award Agreement, if a Participant's employment with the Company is voluntarily terminated by the Participant (other than through retirement, death or disability; see sub-Section (C) below), or is terminated by the Company for Cause or without Cause, then any Restricted Stock or Performance Award  previously granted to that Participant under the Plan which remains unvested, shall automatically lapse and be forfeited at the close of business on the date of the Participant's termination of employment.
(B)
          
 
Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, or otherwise determined by the Committee and included in the applicable Award Agreement, if a Participant's employment is terminated because of retirement, death or disability (with the determination of disability to be made within the sole discretion of the Committee), any Award held by the Participant shall remain outstanding and vest or become exercisable according to the Award's original terms; provided, however, that any Restricted Stock held by the Participant which remains unvested as of the date of retirement, death or disability shall immediately vest and become non-forfeitable as of such date.
(C)
          
 
The Committee or the Chief Executive Officer may prescribe new or additional terms for the vesting, exercise or realization of any Award; provided, however, that, in accordance with Article III. Section 4 of the Company's Bylaws, any such action with respect to the Chief Executive Officer or the President must be approved by the Board of Directors  and any such action with respect to a Participant subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act must be approved by the Committee.
(D)
         
  Awards shall be evidenced by Award Agreements having terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the Plan, as prescribed by the Committee.  Award Agreements need not be uniform.

Award Agreements
 
  By filing a written request with the Committee or the Company not later than December 31st of any calendar year, a Participant may elect to defer receipt of all or any portion of any stock to be awarded pursuant to a Restricted Stock award, Performance Award or Other Stock-Based Award which, absent such election, the Participant would be entitled to receive during the calendar year following the Participant's request (hereafter referred to as the "Deferred Award").  The Deferred Award will be delivered to the Participant on January 2nd of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which the deferral election is made.  Successive elections may be made with respect to the same Deferred Award to defer from year to year the receipt of such Deferred Award.  Each Participant shall be solely responsible for determining the personal income tax effect of making any deferral election; the Company makes no representation that such election shall have the effect of deferring receipt of any income attributable to the Deferred Award for federal income tax purposes.

Amendments to the Plan
 
materially increase the total number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan (except as provided in Section 4);
(i)

(iii)
         
 
.  The Committee may waive any conditions or rights under, amend any terms of, or alter any Award theretofore granted; provided that, no change in any Award shall reduce the benefit accruing to any Participant without the consent of the Participant; and provided further that, no amendment, without the approval of the stockholders, may be made to any outstanding Option to lower the purchase price per Share under that Option (or to cancel and replace any outstanding Option with a new Option having a lower purchase price per Share).
(b)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Award intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, no adjustment shall be authorized to the extent the adjustment would cause the Award to fail to qualify unless otherwise determined in the sole discretion of the Committee.
(c)

Performance Objectives
 
.  Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") will be compiled for a peer group of companies (the "Target Group") for the Performance Period immediately preceding each Normal Vesting Date.  TSR for each such company is measured by dividing the sum of (i) the dividends on the common stock of such company during the Performance Period, assuming dividend reinvestment, and (ii) the difference between the price of a share of such company's common stock at the end and at the beginning of the period (appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, spin-off, merger or other similar corporate events) by (iii) the price of a share of such company's common stock at the beginning of the period.
A.
                
Total Shareholder Return
 
.  The applicable Target Group shall be selected by the Compensation Committee, acting in its sole discretion, at the beginning of the calendar year immediately preceding each Normal Vesting Date (or not later than 90 days after the commencement of such calendar year).  The same Target Group shall be utilized to determine the number of Performance Shares vesting under all Performance Award Agreements of Valero having a similar Normal Vesting Date, but the decision of the Compensation Committee as to the composition of such Target Group shall be final.
B.
                
Target Group
 
.  The TSR for the Performance Period for Valero and each company in the Target Group shall be arranged by rank from best to worst according to the TSR achieved by each company.  The total number of companies so ranked shall then be divided into four groups ("Quartiles").  For purposes of assigning companies to Quartiles (with the 1st Quartile being the best and the 4th Quartile being the worst), the total number of companies ranked (including Valero) shall be divided into four groups as nearly equal in number as possible.  The number of companies in each group shall be the total number contained in the Target Group divided by four.  If the total number of companies is not evenly divisible by four, so that there is a fraction contained in such quotient, the extra company(ies) represented by such fraction will be included in one or more Quartiles as follows:

Performance Ranking
 
 
Any performance shares not awarded as shares of Common Stock as a result of a ranking in the 3rd or 4th Quartile will carry forward for one more Performance Period; up to 100% of the Performance Shares carried forward may be awarded based on Valero's TSR during the next Performance Period, provided, that if any Performance Shares are carried forward due to a ranking in the 3rd Quartile, no such shares shall be awarded unless Valero's TSR in the subsequent period is in the 2nd or 1st Quartile.
.  The number of shares of Common Stock, if any, that Participant will be entitled to receive in settlement of the vested Performance Shares will be determined on each Normal Vesting Date and, subject to the provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, on such Normal Vesting Date, the following percentage of the vested Performance Shares will be awarded as shares of Common Stock to the Participant if Valero's TSR during the Performance Period falls within the following ranges:

If Valero's TSR is the highest achieved in the 1st Quartile for the Performance Period, Participant shall be awarded a number of shares of Common Stock equal to 200% of the Performance Shares that vested during the Performance Period.
 
.  Except for a Change of Control (described below), if Participant separates from service (as contemplated under IRC Section 409A) with Valero for reasons other than his termination for "cause" (as defined pursuant to the Employment Agreement then in effect between Valero and Participant), or if Participant dies or becomes disabled (as contemplated in IRC Section 409A), then upon the occurrence of such an event, those Performance Shares that have not vested or have not been forfeited and for which a Normal Vesting Date has not yet occurred shall be deemed to have been earned and vested at the target level (2nd Quartile).  If Participant's separation from service is due to his termination by Valero for "cause" (as defined pursuant to the Employment Agreement then in effect between Valero and Participant), then those Performance Shares for which the Normal Vesting Date has not yet occurred shall be forfeited as of the effective date of termination of Participant's separation from service.

If a Change of Control occurs with respect to Valero, then each Performance Period with respect to any Performance Shares that have not vested or been forfeited shall be terminated effective as of the date of such Change of Control (a "Change of Control Vesting Date"); the TSR for Valero and for each company in the Target Group shall be determined for each such shortened Performance Period and the percentage of Performance Shares to be received by the Participant for each such Performance Period shall be determined in accordance with Paragraph 4 and shall be distributed as soon as administratively practicable thereafter.  For purposes of determining the number of Performance Shares to be received as of any Change of Control Vesting Date, the Target Group as most recently determined by the Compensation Committee prior to the date of the Change of Control shall be used.

Vesting and Delivery of Shares
 
.  The Performance Shares granted hereunder shall vest over a period of three years in equal, one-third increments with the first increment vesting on the date of the regularly scheduled meeting of the Board's Compensation Committee ("Meeting Date") in January 2006, and the second and third increments vesting on the Committee's Meeting Dates in January 2007 and January 2008, respectively (each of these three vesting dates is referred to as a "Normal Vesting Date"), such vesting being subject to verification of attainment of the Performance Objectives described in Paragraph 4 by the Compensation Committee.  If the Committee is unable to meet in January of a given year, then the Normal Vesting Date for that year will be the date not later than March 31 of that year as selected by the Compensation Committee.

Vesting
 
  Until shares of Common Stock are actually issued to Participant (or his or her estate) in settlement of the Performance Shares, neither Participant nor any person claiming by, through or under Participant shall have any rights as a stockholder of Valero (including, without limitation, voting rights or any right to receive dividends or other distributions) with respect to such shares, and Participant's status with respect to the issuance of such shares shall be that of a general creditor of Valero.

Rights
 
.

Performance Objectives
 
.  Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") will be compiled for a peer group of companies (the "Target Group") for the Performance Period immediately preceding each Normal Vesting Date.  TSR for each such company is measured by dividing the sum of (i) the dividends on the common stock of such company during the Performance Period, assuming dividend reinvestment, and (ii) the difference between the price of a share of such company's common stock at the end and at the beginning of the period (appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, spin-off, merger or other similar corporate events) by (iii) the price of a share of such company's common stock at the beginning of the period.
A.
                
Total Shareholder Return
.  The applicable Target Group shall be selected by the Compensation Committee, acting in its sole discretion, at the beginning of the calendar year immediately preceding each Normal Vesting Date (or not later than 90 days after the commencement of such calendar year).  The same Target Group shall be utilized to determine the number of Performance Shares vesting under all Performance Award Agreements of Valero having a similar Normal Vesting Date, but the decision of the Compensation Committee as to the composition of such Target Group shall be final.
B.
                
Target Group
 
.  The TSR for the Performance Period for Valero and each company in the Target Group shall be arranged by rank from best to worst according to the TSR achieved by each company.  The total number of companies so ranked shall then be divided into four groups ("Quartiles").  For purposes of assigning companies to Quartiles (with the 1st Quartile being the best and the 4th Quartile being the worst), the total number of companies ranked (including Valero) shall be divided into four groups as nearly equal in number as possible.  The number of companies in each group shall be the total number contained in the Target Group divided by four.  If the total number of companies is not evenly divisible by four, so that there is a fraction contained in such quotient, the extra company(ies) represented by such fraction will be included in one or more Quartiles as follows:

Performance Ranking
 
 
Any performance shares not awarded as shares of Common Stock as a result of a ranking in the 3rd or 4th Quartile will carry forward for one more Performance Period; up to 100% of the Performance Shares carried forward may be awarded based on Valero's TSR during the next Performance Period, provided, that if any Performance Shares are carried forward due to a ranking in the 3rd Quartile, no such shares shall be awarded unless Valero's TSR in the subsequent period is in the 2nd or 1st Quartile.
 
.  The number of shares of Common Stock, if any, that Participant will be entitled to receive in settlement of the vested Performance Shares will be determined on each Normal Vesting Date and, subject to the provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, on such Normal Vesting Date, the following percentage of the vested Performance Shares will be awarded as shares of Common Stock to the Participant if Valero's TSR during the Performance Period falls within the following ranges:
D.

Termination of Employment
 
.  Except for a Change of Control (described below), if Participant's employment is voluntarily terminated by the Participant (other than through retirement, death or disability), or is terminated by Valero for "cause" (as defined pursuant to the Plan), then (a) those Performance Shares that have not vested or been forfeited, and for which a Normal Vesting Date occurs on or before the 30th day following the date of such termination, shall be awarded as shares of Common Stock on such Normal Vesting Date subject to the attainment of the performance objectives in accordance with Paragraph 4 hereof, and (b) any such Performance Shares for which a Normal Vesting Date does not occur within such 30-day period, or that are not otherwise awarded as shares of Common Stock on a Normal Vesting Date as a result of the application of Paragraph 4, shall thereupon be forfeited.

If a Change of Control occurs with respect to Valero, then each Performance Period with respect to any Performance Shares that have not vested or been forfeited shall be terminated effective as of the date of such Change of Control (a "Change of Control Vesting Date"); the TSR for Valero and for each company in the Target Group shall be determined for each such shortened Performance Period and the percentage of Performance Shares to be received by the Participant for each such Performance Period shall be determined in accordance with Paragraph 4 and shall be distributed as soon as administratively practicable thereafter.  For purposes of determining the number of Performance Shares to be received as of any Change of Control Vesting Date, the Target Group as most recently determined by the Compensation Committee prior to the date of the Change of Control shall be used.

The foregoing list of express powers granted to the Committee upon the adoption of this Plan is not necessarily intended to be either complete or exclusive, and the Committee shall, in addition to the specific powers granted by this Plan, have such powers not inconsistent with the Plan or Rule 16b-3, whether or not expressly authorized herein, which it may deem necessary, desirable, advisable, proper, convenient or appropriate for the supervision and administration of this Plan.  Except as otherwise specifically provided herein , the decisions and judgment of the Committee on any question or claim arising hereunder shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Participants and all persons claiming by, through or under a Participant.

Directors Elected after the Effective Date of this Plan
 
(i)  For so long as this Plan is in effect and shares are available for the grant of Options hereunder, each person who shall first become a Non-Employee Director after the Effective Date of this Plan shall be granted, on the date of his or her election, an Option to purchase 5,000 shares of Common Stock at a per share Option Price equal to the Fair Market Value (as defined in Section 7 below) of a share of Common Stock on such date (such number of shares being subject to the adjustments provided in Section 15 of this Plan).
 
(ii)  For so long as this Plan is in effect and shares are available for the grant of Options hereunder, at the Annual Meeting each year beginning in the year after the year of his or her first election as a Non-Employee Director, there shall be granted to each person who shall become a Non-Employee Director after the Effective Date of this Plan, and is continuing as a Non-Employee Director on the date of such Annual Meeting, an Option to purchase 2,500 shares of Common Stock at a per share Option Price equal to the Fair Market Value (as defined in Section 7 below) of a share of Common Stock on such date (such number of shares being subject to the adjustments provided in Section 15 of this Plan).
 
.  Pursuant to the terms of the Plan and Agreement of Merger dated January 31, 1997, among Valero Energy Corporation (subsequently renamed "PG&E Gas Transmission, Texas Corporation") (hereafter "GTT"), PG&E Corporation and PG&E Acquisition Corporation, the Employee Benefits Agreement dated as of July 31, 1997 (the "EBA"), between GTT and the Company, and the GTT Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan (the "GTT NEDSOP"), certain stock options previously awarded by GTT under the GTT NEDSOP will be automatically converted at the Time of Distribution (as defined in the Agreement and Plan of Distribution dated July 30, 1997, between GTT and the Company) into Options to purchase shares under this Plan.  Each such GTT option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Time of Distribution and is held by a person who, immediately before the Time of Distribution, is a Non-Employee Director, or their respective beneficiaries and dependents, shall be converted in accordance with the EBA into Options to purchase shares under this Plan.  Each such GTT option eligible to be replaced by an Option under this Plan shall be replaced with an Option with respect to a number of shares equal to the number of shares of the common stock, $1.00 par value per share, of GTT ("GTT Common Stock") subject to such GTT option immediately before such replacement, multiplied by the Ratio, rounded up to the

The other terms and conditions of any such GTT option, including the vesting and termination dates thereof, shall remain unchanged, except as may be necessary to conform to the provisions of the Plan or as otherwise may be determined by the Committee.  For purposes of this Plan, "Ratio" shall mean the amount obtained by dividing the average of the daily high and low trading prices per share of GTT Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") Composite Tape (the "NYSE Tape") on each of the last 15 consecutive full NYSE trading days (the "Averaging Period") ending on and including the trading day preceding the Distribution Date (as defined in the Plan and Agreement of Distribution, between GTT and the Company) (the "Company Price") by the difference between (a) the Company Price and (b) the product of (1) the Per Share Merger Consideration (as defined in the Plan and Agreement of Merger, among GTT, PG&E Corporation and PG&E Acquisition Corporation (the "Merger Agreement")) and (2) the average of the daily high and low prices per share of the Acquiror Common Stock (as defined in the Merger Agreement) as reported on the NYSE Tape during the Averaging Period.
 
.  The individuals who shall be eligible to participate in the Plan shall be those individuals who are members of the Board of Directors of the Company who, at the time of a grant hereunder, are not employees of the Company or an Affiliate (as defined in Section 11 below).  An employee-director who retires from employment with the Company or an Affiliate shall be (without further action by the Committee) eligible to participate in the Plan and shall be entitled to receive the Option grants described in Section 4(b) immediately upon commencement of his or her service as a Non-Employee Director.

Eligibility
 
.  The price at which a share subject to an Option may be purchased pursuant to an Option granted under this Plan (the "Option Price") shall be its Fair Market Value on the date the Option is granted.  The "Fair Market Value" of a share of Common Stock shall be the average of the "high" and "low" sales prices of a share of Common Stock on that date as reported by the principal national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed if the Common Stock is listed on a national securities exchange, or the average of the bid and asked price of a share of Common Stock on that date as reported in the NASDAQ listing if the Common Stock is not listed on a national securities exchange.  If no closing price or quotes are reported on that date or if, in the discretion of the Committee, another means of determining the Fair Market Value of a share of stock on that date is necessary or advisable, the Committee may provide for another means for determining the Fair Market Value.

Unless otherwise prescribed by the Committee, Options may be exercised only by written notice of exercise (the "Exercise Notice"), in the form prescribed by the Committee, delivered to the Company to the Stock Option Plan administrator, and signed by the Participant or other person acting on behalf of the Participant.  The date on which the Exercise Notice is delivered to the Company shall be the "Notice Date."  The Exercise Notice shall specify a date (the "Settlement Date"), not less than five business days nor more than ten business days following the Notice Date, upon which the shares or other rights shall be issued or transferred to the Participant (or other person entitled to exercise the Option) and the Option's exercise price shall be paid to the Company.
(a)
          
 
Unless otherwise prescribed by the Committee, on the Settlement Date, the person exercising an Option shall tender to the Company full payment for the shares or other rights with respect to which the Award is exercised, together with an additional amount, in cash, certified check, cashier's check or bank draft approved by the Company, equal to the amount of any taxes required to be collected or withheld by the Company in connection with the exercise of the Option (the "Tax Payment").
(b)
          
 
Subject to any rules and limitations as the Committee may adopt, a person exercising an Option may make the Tax Payment in whole or in part by electing, at or before this time of exercise of the Option, either (i) to have the Company withhold from the number of shares otherwise deliverable a number of shares whose value equals the Tax Payment, or (ii) to deliver certificates for other shares owned by the person exercising the Option, endorsed in blank with appropriate signature guarantee, having a value equal to the amount otherwise to be collected or withheld.  If the Committee shall fail to disapprove the election prior to the Settlement Date, the election will be deemed approved.
(c)
          
 
Subject to any rules and limitations as the Committee may adopt or as may be set forth in any written stock option agreement signed by the Company, a person exercising an Option for the receipt of shares may pay for the shares with other shares of Company Common Stock legally and beneficially owned by that person at the time of the exercise of the Options.
(d)
          
 
Any calculation with respect to a participant's income, required tax withholding or other matters required to be made by the Company upon the exercise of an Option shall be made using the Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock on the Notice Date, whether or not the Exercise Notice is delivered to the Company before or after the close of trading on that date, unless otherwise specified by the Committee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Option exercises using the Company's or a Participant's taxable gain and related tax withholding on the exercise will be calculated using the actual market price at which Shares were sold in the transaction.
(e)
          
"same-day-sale for cash method"
"broker sale for stock method,"
 
Without prior written approval from the Committee, Options shall not be transferable by the optionee except by will or under the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable, during the optionee's lifetime, only by the optionee.

. 
Transferability of Options
.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, if the Committee finds by a majority vote, that the optionee, before or after termination of his capacity as a Non-Employee Director of the Company or any subsidiary corporation, limited partnership or other entity controlling, or controlled by, or under common control with the Company (an "Affiliate"), committed fraud, embezzlement, theft, commission of felony, or proven dishonesty in the course of his relationship to the Company and/or its Affiliates which conduct damaged the Company or its Affiliates, or disclosed trade secrets of the Company or its Affiliates, then any outstanding Options which have not been exercised by optionee shall be forfeited.  The decision of the Committee will be final.
12.
          
Forfeitures
 
.  The Company shall not be required to sell or issue any shares under any Option if issuing the shares shall constitute a violation by the optionee or the Company of any provisions of any law or regulation of any governmental authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Plan or any agreement entered into hereunder, any Option Agreement or other agreement entered into under this Plan and any grant made under this Plan shall be conditional and shall be entered into or granted, as the case may be, subject to acceptance of the option shares for listing on the NYSE.  Each Option granted under this Plan shall be subject to the requirements that, if at any time the Company or the Committee shall determine that the listing, registration or qualification of the shares upon any securities exchange or under any state or federal law of the United states or of any other country or governmental subdivision, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, or investment or other representations, are necessary or desirable in connection with the issue or purchase of shares subject to an Option, that Option shall not be exercised in whole or in part unless the listing, registration, qualification, consent, approval or representations shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company.  Any determination in this connection by the Committee shall be final.  If the shares issuable on exercise of an Option are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, the Company may imprint on the certificate for those shares the following legend or any other legend which counsel for the Company considers necessary or advisable to comply with the Securities Act of 1933 or other applicable state or federal securities laws or regulations:
13.
          
Requirements of Laws and Regulations
 
"The shares of stock represented by this certificate have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or under the securities laws of any state and may not be sold or transferred except upon registration or upon receipt by the Company of an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company, in form and substance satisfactory to the Company, that registration is not required for a sale or transfer."
 
The Company will endeavor to register any securities covered by this Plan under the Securities Act of 1933 (as now in effect or as later amended) and, if any shares are registered, the Company may remove any legend on certificates representing those shares.  The Company shall not be obligated to take any other affirmative action in order to cause the exercise of an Option or the issuance of shares under the Option to comply with any law or regulation or any governmental authority.
 
.  No optionee shall have rights as a stockholder with respect to shares covered by his Option until the date a stock certificate is issued for the shares.  Except as provided in Section 15, no adjustment for dividends, or other matters shall be made if the record date is prior to the date the certificate is issued.
14.
          
No Rights as Stockholder
 
  The granting of any Option shall not impose upon the Company or any of its subsidiaries any obligation to retain or continue to retain any optionee in his capacity as a Non-Employee Director.  The right of the Company, the directors or the stockholders of the Company or of any subsidiary of the Company to terminate any optionee shall not be diminished or affected by reason of the fact that one or more Options have been or will be granted to him.
15.
          
.
No Obligation to Retain Optionee
.  The existence of outstanding Options shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company or its stockholders to make or authorize any or all adjustments, recapitalization, reorganization or other changes in the Company's capital structure or its business, or any merger or consolidation of the Company, or any issue of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting the Common Stock or the rights of the Common Stock, or the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise.
16.
          
Changes in the Company's Capital Structure
 
If all or any portion of an Option is exercised subsequent to any stock dividend, rights distribution, split-up, recapitalization, exchange of shares, merger, spin-off, reorganization or liquidation ("Reorganization Event"), as a result of which securities of any class or rights shall be issued in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock or shares of Common Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of the same or another class of other securities, the person so exercising such Option shall receive, for the aggregate price payable upon the exercise of such Option, (i) the aggregate number and class of shares, rights or other securities for which a recognized market exists, and (ii) a cash amount equal to the fair market value on such date, as reasonably determined by the Committee, of any other property (other than regular cash dividend payments) and of any shares, rights or other securities for which no recognized market exists, which, if shares of Common Stock (as authorized at the date of the granting of such Option) had been purchased at the date of granting of the Option for the same aggregate price (on the basis of the price per share provided in the Option) and had not been disposed of, such person or persons would be holding at the time of such exercise as a result of such purchase and any such Reorganization Event; provided, however, that no fractional share of Common Stock, fractional right or other fractional security shall be issued upon any such exercise, and the aggregate price paid shall be appropriately reduced to reflect any fractional share of Common Stock, fractional right or other fractional security not issued; and provided further, however, that if the exercise of any Option subsequent to any Reorganization Event would, pursuant to this Section 15, require the delivery of shares, rights or other securities which the Company is not then authorized to issue or which in the sole judgment of the Committee cannot be issued without undue effort or expense, the person exercising such Option shall receive, in lieu of such shares, rights or other securities, a cash payment equal to the fair market value on the Exercise Date, as reasonably determined by the Committee, of such shares, rights or other securities.  For purposes of applying the provisions of this Plan, the Preference Share Purchase Rights distributed to stockholders of record of the Company pursuant to the Rights Agreement, or any successor rights, shall be deemed not to have been distributed until the Distribution Date (as defined in the Rights Agreement or any successor agreement).
 
In the event of any change in the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding resulting from a Reorganization Event, the aggregate number and class of shares of Common Stock remaining available to be optioned under this Plan shall be that number and class which a person, to whom an Option had been granted for all of the available shares of Common Stock under this Plan on the date preceding such change as provided in Section 3 would be entitled to receive upon exercise of such Option following such change.  Upon the occurrence of any Reorganization Event, the Committee shall be entitled (but shall not be required) to determine that new Option Agreements (or amendments to the existing Option Agreements) shall be entered into with Participants reflecting such stock dividend or other event.
 
Except as expressly provided before in this Plan, the issue by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, for cash or property, or for labor or services either upon direct sale or upon the exercise of rights or warrants to subscribe for shares, or upon conversion of shares or obligations of the Company convertible into shares or other securities, shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason of it shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Common Stock then subject to outstanding Options.
.  The Board of Directors may modify, revise or terminate this Plan at any time.  However, without the further approval of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of voting stock, or if the provisions of the corporate charter, by-laws or applicable state law prescribe a greater degree of stockholder approval for this action, without the degree of stockholder approval thus required, the Board of Directors may not (a) change the aggregate number of shares which may be issued under Options pursuant to the provisions of this Plan; (b) reduce the Option Price permitted for options; (c) change the class of persons eligible to receive options; (d) extend the term during which an Option may be exercised or the termination date of the Plan; or (e) materially increase any other benefits accruing to the Non-Employee Directors under the Plan or materially modify the requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Plan unless the Board of Directors shall have obtained an opinion of legal counsel to the effect that stockholder approval of the amendment is not required by law or the applicable rules and regulations of, or any agreement with, any national security exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or if the Common Stock is not listed, the rules and regulations of, or any agreement with, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or in order to make available to the optionee with respect to any Option granted under the Plan, the benefits of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or any similar or successor rule.  In addition, the terms of the Plan relating to the number of shares that may be subject to an Option, the times at which Options are to be granted, and the means by which the Option Price for the Options granted is to be determined shall not be amended more than once every six months, other than to comport with the changes in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or the rules under either of those laws.  All Options granted under this Plan shall be subject to the terms and provisions of this Plan and any amendment, modification or revision of this Plan shall be deemed to amend, modify or revise all Options outstanding under this Plan at the time of the amendment, modification or revision.
17.
          
Amendment or Termination of Plan
 
  Each Option granted under this Plan shall be embodied in a written option agreement, which shall be subject to the terms and conditions prescribed above, and shall be signed by the optionee and by the appropriate officer of the Company for and in the name and on behalf of the Company.  Each option agreement shall contain any other provisions that the Committee in its discretion shall deem advisable if they do not conflict with the terms of this Plan.
