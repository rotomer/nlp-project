Valero Energy Corporation Reports
 
 
SAN ANTONIO, April 21, 2005  Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE: VLO) today reported record net income of $534 million, or $1.92 per share, for the first quarter of 2005, which is more than double last year's first quarter net income of $248 million, or $.91 per share (split adjusted).   The company's debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash, was 29.6 percent as of March 31, 2005, compared to 30.7 percent as of December 31, 2004.
 
First quarter operating income for the company's refining segment was $933 million, compared to $495 million for the same period last year.  The significant increase in operating income was primarily the result of record sour crude discounts and distillate margins, which were nearly double last year's levels.  In addition, throughput volumes were higher largely due to a full quarter contribution from the March 2004 acquisition of the Aruba refinery.
 
 "2005 is off to a great start and we are right on track to have another record year," said Bill Greehey, Valero's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  "Despite having three major turnarounds during the quarter, our earnings were nearly two dollars per share.  We continue to demonstrate the benefits of having a large, complex and geographically diverse refining system and the tremendous earnings power we have achieved through our leverage to sour crude processing.
 
"During the quarter, we processed approximately 1.2 million barrels per day of sour and acidic crudes, which is approximately seventy percent of our total crude throughputs.  And, of the sour crude oils we processed, 520,000 barrels per day were heavy sour crude oils, such as Maya, that were purchased at discounts of around $17 per barrel.  That compares to a Maya discount of only $9.38 per barrel last year in the first quarter.
 
"Refined product fundamentals were outstanding in the first quarter and reflect the strong demand for gasoline, distillate and petrochemical feedstocks that we continue to see.  U.S. gasoline demand is up one and a half percent year-to-date over last year's record levels, despite record high pump prices.  Gasoline margins on the Gulf Coast in April have averaged $11.00 per barrel and the outlook, based on the forward curve, is indicating a $7.30 per barrel Gulf Coast gasoline margin for the full year.  Distillate margins are also outstanding and it has become clear that distillate margins are no longer driven primarily by the weather.  Growing global demand for distillate as a transportation fuel has caused on-road diesel and jet fuel to become more of an equal partner with gasoline on a margin basis.  For example, on the U.S. Gulf Coast, distillate margins for April have averaged around $10.00 per barrel, compared to just $0.85 per barrel in April of last year.  Distillate margins for the full year, based on the forward curve, are at about $8.00 per barrel, around $4.00 per barrel better than last year's record average.
"Clearly, the refining industry has entered a new era.  As a result, we believe that we will continue to see higher highs and higher lows for both product margins and sour crude discounts in the future.  Last year, we delivered a 98 percent total shareholder return and the fundamentals for this year and next look just as good or better than we saw in 2004.  That's why I have consistently said our 2005 results should significantly exceed our record 2004 earnings.  And, given our expectation that worldwide refined product demand will continue to outpace growth in refining capacity and the fact that sulfur specifications for gasoline and diesel will further tighten in 2006, we believe our trend of record-setting quarterly results will continue into 2006 and beyond.  For all these reasons, we are convinced that our stock continues to represent a tremendous value to investors," said Greehey.
