EXHIBIT INDEX
 

Exhibit 99.1
SAN ANTONIO, June 17, 2005  Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) today announced that it expects to report record earnings for the second quarter of about $3.00 per share, primarily as a result of exceptionally strong distillate margins and wide sour crude discounts.  In addition, based on the outlook for the remainder of 2005, the company believes that the current First Call consensus estimate for 2005 of $7.51 per share remains too low.
 
Valero Energy Corporation is a Fortune 500 company based in San Antonio, with approximately 20,000 employees and annual revenue of approximately $55 billion. The company owns and operates 14 refineries throughout the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. Valero's refineries have a combined throughput capacity of approximately 2.4 million barrels per day, which represents approximately 12 percent of the total U.S. refining capacity.
