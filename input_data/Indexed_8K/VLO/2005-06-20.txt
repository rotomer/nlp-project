St
rategic Rationale
 
 - 
                 
Premcor assets a great fit with Valero
 
 - 
    Combined company would be largest refiner in North America
 
 - 
    Enhanced geographic diversity, which further increases earnings stability
 
 - 
    Aligned strategies that further increase exposure to light-heavy spread
 
 - 
                 
Combined entity would process around 1 million bpd of Maya-like crudes by 2007
 
 - 
                 
Premcor assets provide profit improvement opportunities
 
 - 
    Ample optimization and strategic opportunities
 
 - 
    Valero has proven track record of increasing reliability, capacity and yields
 
 - 
                 
Market value of refining assets approaching replacement costs
 
 - 
    Scarcity of quality U.S. refining assets
 
 - 
    Acquiring 790 mbpd of capacity at 70% of current replacement cost
Fi
nancial Benefits
 
 - 
                 
Expected to be significantly accretive to earnings and cash flow per share
