Performance Share Awards. Awards of performance shares were granted to six named executive officers of the Company in the quantities stated below.

The performance shares will vest annually in one-third increments beginning in January 2008 upon verification of the Company's attainment of certain performance standards as determined by the Committee. Upon vesting, the performance shares are converted into a number of shares of Common Stock based upon the Company's total shareholder return during rolling three-year periods that end on December 31 of each year prior to the scheduled vesting date. At the end of each performance period, the Company's total shareholder return is compared to its peer group and is ranked by quartile. Holders of the performance shares then earn 0 percent, 50 percent, 100 percent or 150 percent of that portion of the initial grant that is vesting, depending upon whether the Company's total shareholder return is in the last, third, second or first quartile, respectively; holders earn 200 percent if the Company is the highest ranking entity in the peer group.
