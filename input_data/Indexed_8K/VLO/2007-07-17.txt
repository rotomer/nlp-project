Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
.
Non-Employee Directors
On July 12, 2007, the board of directors (the "Board") of Valero Energy Corporation (the "Company" or "Valero"), upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee of the Board ("Compensation Committee"), revised the compensation structure for non-employee members of the Board.
Under the revised compensation structure, non-employee directors will receive a retainer fee of $75,000 per year (increased from $60,000 per year), plus $2,000 for each Board and committee meeting attended in person (increased from $1,500); the $1,000 fee for each Board and committee meeting attended telephonically was not revised. In addition, under the new structure the director who serves as the designated lead director will receive an additional retainer fee of $20,000 per year. The existing committee chair retainer fees were not changed. Thus, a director who serves as chairperson of the Audit or Compensation Committee will receive a chair retainer of $20,000 annually, and a director who serves as chairperson of a committee other than the Audit or Compensation Committee will receive an annual chair retainer of $10,000.
The Company's director compensation structure also includes grants of equity awards to supplement the cash compensation paid to non-employee directors and to increase the directors' identification with the interests of Valero's stockholders through ownership of Valero's common stock, $.01 par value ("Common Stock"). These awards are granted under the Company's Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors ("Director Stock Plan") and/or its 2005 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the "Omnibus Plan"). Under Valero's prior compensation structure, each non-employee director received an annual grant of Common Stock valued at $80,000 which vested in equal installments over a three-year period. Under the revised compensation structure, each non-employee director will receive an annual grant of Common Stock valued at $160,000 ("Director Shares") on the date of Valero's annual meeting of stockholders. For first-time grants of Director Shares to new a director, the shares will vest (become nonforfeitable) in equal annual installments over a three-year period. For second-time grants, one-third of the Director Shares will vest on the first anniversary of their grant date, and the remaining two-thirds will vest on the second anniversary of their grant date. For third-time grants, 100% of the Director Shares will vest on the first anniversary of their grant date. Subsequent grants will not be restricted and will vest immediately upon receipt.
The compensation structure for grants of stock options to non-employee directors did not change. Thus, as in prior practice, upon a non-employee director's initial election to the Valero Board, the director will receive a one-time grant of 10,000 options from the Omnibus Plan that will vest and become exercisable on the first anniversary of their grant date. Stock options granted from the Omnibus Plan will have an exercise price equal to the market price of the Common Stock on the date of grant, and will expire on the seventh anniversary of their grant date.

Named Executive Officers
     
Salaries.
On July 12, 2007, the Board's independent directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, granted an increase in the annual base salaries of Valero's senior executive officers to the following amounts:
     .
SERP Amendments
Valero maintains a non-qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") which provides supplemental pension benefits to certain highly compensated employees. The SERP provides eligible employees with additional post-retirement benefits that cannot be achieved with tax-qualified plans due to Internal Revenue Code limits on (i) annual compensation that can be taken into account under qualified plans, or (ii) annual benefits that can be provided under qualified plans. All of Valero's "named executive officers" (as determined pursuant to Item 402(a) of Regulation S-K) participate in the SERP.
On July 11, 2007, the Compensation Committee approved amendments to Valero's SERP to, among other things, eliminate the SERP's annuity form of benefit payment, and replace it with a lump sum form of benefit payment. Additional amendments were approved to conform certain provisions of the SERP with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder. The SERP amendments will be effective as of January 1, 2008. An amended and restated SERP document will be filed as an exhibit to Valero's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2007.
     .
Change of Control Severance Agreements
Valero has previously entered into with each of its executive officers. The benefits and rights that accrue to the officers under the agreements are generally categorized as "Tier I," "Tier II," and "Tier III" benefits. On July 11, 2007, the Compensation Committee authorized the Company to enter into Tier I with Messrs. King, Ciskowski, Marcogliese, Gorder, and Edwards, who were formerly parties to Tier II-type agreements (Mr. Klesse is already party to a Tier I agreement).
Change of Control Severance Agreements
Change of Control Severance Agreements
The Tier I agreements generally provide that if after a change of control, as defined in the agreement, the company terminates the executive's employment (other than for "cause," death or "disability," as defined in the agreement) or if the executive terminates his employment for "good reason," as defined in the agreement, the executive is generally entitled to receive the following: (A) a lump sum cash payment equal to the sum of (i) accrued and unpaid compensation through the date of termination, including a pro-rata annual bonus; (ii) three times
 
the sum of the executive's annual base salary plus the executive's highest annual bonus from the past three years, (iii) the amount of the actuarial present value of the pension benefits (qualified and nonqualified) the executive would have received for an additional three years of service, and (iv) the equivalent of three years of employer contributions under Valero's tax-qualified and supplemental defined contribution plans; (B) continued welfare benefits for three years; and (C) up to $25,000 of outplacement services.

Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
On July 12, 2007, the Board approved amendments to Valero's bylaws ("Bylaws") to, among other things, provide for a majority voting standard in uncontested elections of directors. The following summary of the amendments to the Bylaws does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the amended and restated Bylaws filed as Exhibit 3.01 to this report and incorporated by reference herein.
Article I, Section 9 of the Bylaws was amended to describe the requirements for the information that must be contained in a stockholder's notice of a nomination of a person for election to Valero's Board, or a proposal of business to be considered at a meeting of Valero's stockholders.
Article I, Section 12 was added to the Bylaws (i) to provide that each director to be elected by stockholders shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, except in the instance of a contested election, and (ii) to provide for a tendered-resignation procedure in the event an incumbent director does not receive a majority of the votes cast for his or her election.
Article I, Section 13 was added to the Bylaws to provide that a director nominee, to be eligible for reelection or election, must deliver to the Company's Secretary a completed and signed questionnaire with respect to the background and qualification of such person and the background of any other person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made.
Certain technical and conforming amendments were also made to the Bylaws. The amendments were effective as of July 12, 2007.

Upon written request of any person or persons who have duly called a special meeting, it shall be the duty of the Secretary to fix the date and time of the special meeting (which date shall be not less than ten nor more than sixty days after receipt of the request) and to give due notice thereof. If the Secretary shall neglect or refuse to fix the date or time of the meeting or to give notice thereof, the person or persons calling the meeting may do so. Any such notice shall include a statement of the purpose or purposes for which the special meeting is called. Any previously scheduled special meeting of the stockholders may be postponed by resolution of the Board of Directors upon public notice given on or prior to the date previously scheduled for such special meeting of stockholders.
Section 2

Quorum and Voting
     (a) Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws, at any meeting of stockholders the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereat and having a majority of the voting power with respect to a subject matter shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business as to that subject matter, and all questions with respect to a subject matter, except the election of directors, shall be decided by vote of the shares having a majority of the voting power so represented in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereat. The stockholders present at any duly organized meeting may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.
     (b) Every stockholder having the right to vote shall be entitled to vote in person, or by proxy appointed by an instrument in writing subscribed by such stockholder (which for purposes hereof may include a signature and form of proxy pursuant to a facsimile or telegraphic form of proxy or any other instrument acceptable to the duly appointed inspector or inspectors of such election), bearing a date not more than three years prior to voting, unless such instrument provides for a longer period, and filed with the Secretary of the Corporation before, or at the time of, the meeting, or by such other method as may be permitted under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (the "DGCL"), and approved by the Board of Directors. If such instrument shall designate two or more persons to act as proxies, unless such instrument shall provide to the contrary, a majority of such persons present at any meeting at which their powers thereunder are to be exercised shall have and may exercise all the powers of voting thereby conferred, or if only one be present, then such powers may be exercised by that one; or, if an even number attend and a majority do not agree on any particular issue, each proxy so attending shall be entitled to exercise such powers in respect of the same portion of the shares as he is of the proxies representing such shares.
     (c) Any other corporation owning voting shares in the Corporation may vote the same by its President or by proxy appointed by him, unless some other person shall be appointed to vote such shares by resolution of the Board of Directors of such shareholder corporation. A partnership holding shares of the Corporation may vote such shares by any general partner or by proxy appointed by any general partner.
     (d) Shares standing in the name of a deceased person may be voted by the executor or administrator of such deceased person, either in person or by proxy. Shares standing in the name of a guardian, conservator or trustee may be voted by such fiduciary, either in person or by proxy, but no such fiduciary shall be entitled to vote shares held in such fiduciary capacity without a transfer of such shares into the name of such fiduciary. Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver. A stockholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such shares, unless in the transfer by the pledgor on the books of the Corporation, he has expressly empowered the pledgee to vote thereon, in which case only the pledgee, or his proxy, may represent the stock and vote thereon.
Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the presiding officer of any meeting or the holders of a majority of the shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, whether a quorum is present, shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present any action may be taken that could have been taken at the meeting originally called; provided, that if the adjournment is for more than thirty days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a

Nominations and Proposals for Annual Meetings of Stockholders
     (a) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders (i) pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting, (ii) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (iii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who (A) was a stockholder of record at the time of giving of the notice provided for in this Section 9 and at the time of the annual meeting, (B) is entitled to vote with respect to such matter at the meeting, and (C) complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 9. At any annual meeting of stockholders, the presiding officer of such meeting may announce the nominations and other business to be considered which are set forth in the Corporation's notice of meeting and proxy statement and, by virtue thereof, such nominations and other business so announced shall be properly before such meeting and may be considered and voted upon by the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote thereat without further requirement of nomination, motion or second.
     (b) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of Paragraph (a) of this Section 9, the stockholder making such nominations or proposing such other business must theretofore have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation and such other business must otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 60th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 90th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 60th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. To be in proper form, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary must:
     (i) set forth, as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (A) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, if any, (B) the class or series and number of shares of the Corporation that are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, if any, as of the date of such notice (which information shall be supplemented by such stockholder and beneficial owner not later than 10 days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date), and (C) any other information relating to such stockholder and beneficial owner that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal and/or for the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Exchange Act");
     (ii) if the notice relates to any business other than the nomination of a director that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, set forth (A) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest of such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, in such business, and (B) a description of all agreements, arrangements and understandings between such stockholder and beneficial owner and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such business by such stockholder;
 
     (iii) set forth, as to each person, if any, whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director (A) all information relating to such person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected) and (B) a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the past three years, and any other relationships, between or among such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, and their respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the one hand, and each proposed nominee, and his or her respective affiliates and associates, or others acting on concert therewith, on the other hand, including, without limitation all information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Rule 404 promulgated under Regulation S-K if the stockholder making the nomination and any beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is made, if any, or any affiliate or associate thereof or person acting in concert therewith, were the "registrant" for purposes of such rule and the nominee were a director or executive officer of such registrant; and
     (iv) with respect to each nominee for election or reelection to the Board of Directors, include the completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement required by Section 13 of this Article I. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the Corporation or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee.
     (c) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of Paragraph (b) of this Section 9 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation at an annual meeting is increased, whether by increase in the size of the Board of Directors, or by any vacancy in the Board of Directors to be filled at such annual meeting, and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least 70 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 9 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for such vacant positions and for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.
. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the Corporation who (i) is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 10 and at the time of the special meeting, (ii) is entitled to vote at the meeting and (iii) complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 10. In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by Paragraph (b) of Section 9 of this Article I (including the completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement required by Section 13 of this Article I) shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 90th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 60th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at

Except as otherwise provided by law, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the presiding officer of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws, and if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with these Bylaws, to declare that such defective proposal shall be disregarded.
     (b) For purposes of Sections 9 and 10 of this Article I, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Services, Associated Press, Reuters or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
     (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 9, 10 and 11 of this Article I, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth herein.

For purposes of this Section 12, a majority of votes cast shall mean that the number of shares voted "for" a director's election exceeds 50% of the number of votes cast with respect to that director's election. Votes cast shall include votes to withhold authority in each case and exclude abstentions with respect to that director's election. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a contested election of directors, directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. For purposes of this Bylaw, a contested election shall mean any election of directors in which the number of candidates for election as directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected.
Majority Vote
     (b) . If a nominee for director who is an incumbent director is not elected and no successor has been elected at such meeting, the director shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. The Nominating/Governance Committee shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors shall act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Nominating/Governance Committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the Board's decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The Nominating/Governance Committee in making its recommendation, and the Board of Directors in making its decision, may each consider any factors or other information that it considers appropriate and relevant. The director who tenders his or her resignation shall not participate in the recommendation of the Nominating/Governance Committee or the decision of the Board of Directors with respect to his or her resignation. If such incumbent director's resignation is not accepted by the Board of Directors, such director shall continue to serve until the next annual meeting and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal.
