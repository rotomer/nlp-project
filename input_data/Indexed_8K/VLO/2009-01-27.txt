Exhibit 99.01
SAN ANTONIO, January 27, 2009  Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE: VLO) today reported fourth quarter 2008 net income of $732 million, or $1.41 per share, excluding a noncash loss from the impairment of goodwill of $4.1 billion, or $4.0 billion after taxes. This compares to fourth quarter 2007 net income of $567 million, or $1.02 per share. Including the goodwill impairment loss, the company reported a fourth quarter 2008 net loss of $3.3 billion, or $6.36 per share. The goodwill impairment loss represents a write-off of the entire balance of the company's goodwill from the application of impairment testing criteria under existing accounting rules.
The company reported a fourth quarter 2008 operating loss of $2.9 billion. Excluding the goodwill impairment loss, fourth quarter 2008 operating income was $1.2 billion compared to $884 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher margins for distillate products such as diesel and jet fuels, increased margins for secondary products such as asphalt and petroleum coke, and strong retail margins. Also contributing to the increase in operating income was the favorable effect from a year-end LIFO increment of $327 million, or $214 million after taxes. Partially offsetting the increase in operating income were lower gasoline margins and lower overall refinery throughput volumes.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, the company reported a net loss of $1.1 billion, or $2.16 per share. Excluding the goodwill impairment loss, full year 2008 net income was $2.9 billion, or $5.42 per share, which compares to full year 2007 income from continuing operations of $4.6 billion, or $7.72 per share.
"Despite very low gasoline margins in the fourth quarter, we reported solid operating results that showed the competitiveness of our operations," said Bill Klesse, Valero's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. "Our complex refineries benefited from favorable discounts on feedstocks, and our retail network had a record quarter when its margins improved as crude oil prices declined. Regarding the goodwill write-down, investors should understand that this noncash charge does not affect the cash flow generation from our assets or Valero's competitive position within the refining industry."
 
The company's fourth quarter 2008 capital spending was $1.1 billion, of which $129 million was for turnaround expenditures. For the full year 2008, capital spending was $3.2 billion, of which $408 million was for turnaround expenditures. The company also used $77 million to maintain dividend payments on its common stock and spent $181 million to purchase 8.4 million shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter. In addition to paying $299 million for dividends in 2008, the company returned $955 million of cash to shareholders by purchasing nearly 23 million shares, or more than 4% of shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.
"Looking at market conditions for the coming year, the sluggish economy is clearly a headwind against demand growth for refined products," Klesse said. "To help stabilize margins, refiners must continue to use discipline in matching production with demand. At Valero, we are managing our run rates according to market demand. For example, we will shut down the entire Texas City refinery instead of running portions of it during scheduled maintenance this quarter. At our Corpus Christi East Plant, we have shut down the fluid catalytic cracking unit, which primarily produces gasoline. Across our system, the average utilization rate at our fluid catalytic cracking units is currently in the range of 70 percent to 75 percent of capacity.
"In this environment of economic weakness, staying competitive is essential to our investors. Fortunately, we have a strong financial position with ample liquidity and an investment-grade credit rating. We remain focused on prudently executing our growth projects while reducing operating expenses and overhead costs. Considering the uncertain outlook for the economy, we are severely reducing our estimate for full-year 2009 capital spending to $2.7 billion from the previous estimate of $3.5 billion. We are cutting discretionary projects at many of our refineries and delaying other projects, although our safety and regulatory projects remain as planned. Working to grow long-term value for our shareholders, while maintaining a strong balance sheet, remains our top priority."
Valero's senior management will hold a conference call at 11 a.m. ET (10 a.m. CT) today to discuss this earnings release and provide an update on company operations. A live broadcast of the conference call will be available on the company's web site at .
