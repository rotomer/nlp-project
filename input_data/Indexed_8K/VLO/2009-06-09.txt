The Company agrees that, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company that, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Shares that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433; provided that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule III hereto. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives or the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free
 
Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.
     7. The several obligations of the Underwriters hereunder shall be subject to the following conditions:
     (a) the representations and warranties of the Company contained herein are true and correct on the date hereof, as of the Time of Sale, and as of the Closing Date as if made on the date hereof, as of the Time of Sale and as of the Closing Date and the Company shall have complied with all agreements and all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date;
     (b) the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Securities Act; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall be in effect, and no proceedings for such purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act shall be pending before or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to your satisfaction;
     (c) subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, there shall not have occurred any downgrading, nor shall any notice have been given of any intended or potential downgrading or of any review for a possible change that does not indicate an improvement in the rating accorded any of the Company's securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act;
     (d) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any prospective material adverse change, or any development involving a material adverse change, in or affecting the general affairs, business, prospects, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, the effect of which in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus;
 
     (e) the Representatives shall have received on and as of the Closing Date a certificate of an executive officer of the Company, with specific knowledge about the Company's financial matters, satisfactory to you to the effect set forth in Sections 7(a), 7(b), 7(c) and 7(d) (with respect to the respective representations, warranties, agreements and conditions of the Company) and to the further effect that there has not occurred any prospective material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the general affairs, business, prospects, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from that set forth or contemplated in the Time of Sale Information and the Registration Statement;
     (f) the Underwriters shall have received on the Closing Date an opinion of Baker Botts L.L.P., outside counsel for the Company, to the effect that:
     (i) the Company has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the corporate power and authority to own its property and to conduct its business as described in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus;
     (ii) the authorized capital stock of the Company conforms as to legal matters to the description thereof contained in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus;
     (iii) the Shares have been duly authorized and, when issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and the issuance of such Shares will not be subject to any preemptive or similar rights under the Company's certificate of incorporation or by-laws or under Delaware General Corporation Law or, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, any agreement to which the Company is a party;
     (iv) this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
     (v) the execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, this Agreement will not contravene any provision of applicable law or the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company;
     (vi) the statements (A) in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Common Stock," (B) in the Prospectus under the caption "Underwriting,"
 
and (C) in the Registration Statement in Item 15, in each case insofar as such statements constitute summaries of legal matters, accurately present the information called for with respect to such legal matters, documents and proceedings and accurately summarize the matters referred to therein;
     (vii) although the discussion set forth in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus under the heading "Certain U.S. federal income tax and estate tax considerations" does not purport to discuss all possible United States Federal income and estate tax consequences of the purchase, ownership, and disposition of the Shares, in such counsel's opinion, such discussion constitutes, in all material respects, a fair and accurate summary of the United States Federal income and estate tax consequences of the ownership of the Shares and the disposition of the Shares by the holders addressed therein, based upon current law and subject to the qualifications set forth therein; and
     (viii) the Company is not, and after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Shares and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus will not be, required to register as an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
     In addition, such counsel shall state that such counsel has participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company and with representatives of its independent registered public accounting firm and representatives of the Underwriters and counsel to the Underwriters at which conferences the contents of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and any amendment and supplement thereto and related matters were discussed and, although such counsel has not undertaken to determine independently and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto (except as expressly provided above), no facts have come to such counsel's attention to lead such counsel to believe that (A) the Registration Statement and Prospectus (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein as to which such counsel need not comment) do not comply as to form in all material respects with the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder or the Registration Statement, at the date of this Agreement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
(B)(i)
 
misleading or (iii) the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto as of its date and the Closing Date contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; in each case, except for financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data as to which such counsel need not comment.
     (g) the Underwriters shall have received on the Closing Date an opinion of Jay D. Browning, Esq., Corporate Secretary and Senior Vice President, Corporate Law for the Company, to the effect that:
     (i) the Company is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
     (ii) each Significant Subsidiary of the Company has been duly formed, is validly existing in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation, has the corporate, limited liability company, limited partnership or partnership power and authority to own its property and to conduct its business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
     (iii) the shares of Common Stock outstanding prior to the issuance of the Shares have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable;
     (iv) all of the issued shares of capital stock of each subsidiary of the Company have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims;
     (v) the execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, this Agreement will not contravene any agreement, indenture or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is known to such counsel and material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to the best of such counsel's knowledge, any judgment, order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court having jurisdiction over the Company or
 
any subsidiary, and no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or qualification with, any governmental body or agency that has not already been obtained is required for the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, except such as may be required by the securities or Blue Sky laws of the various states in connection with the offer and sale of the Shares;
     (vi) the statements (A) in the Registration Statement in Item 15, and (B) incorporated by reference into the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus under the captions "Items 1., 1A. & 2.Business, Risk Factors and Properties-Environmental Matters" and "Item 3.Legal Proceedings" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, in each case insofar as such statements constitute summaries of legal matters, accurately present the information called for with respect to such legal matters, documents and proceedings and accurately summarize the matters referred to therein;
     (vii) after due inquiry, such counsel does not know of any legal or governmental investigations or proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject that are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus and are not so described or of any statutes, regulations, contracts or other documents that are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement that are not described or filed as required;
     (viii) no facts have come to such counsel's attention to lead such counsel to believe that the Company and its subsidiaries (A) are not in compliance with any and all applicable Environmental Laws, (B) have not received all permits, licenses or other approvals required of them under applicable Environmental Laws to conduct their respective businesses or (C) are not in compliance with all terms and conditions of any such permit, license or approval, except as described in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and except where such noncompliance with Environmental Laws, failure to receive required permits, licenses or other approvals or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of such permits, licenses or approvals would not, singly or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and
 
     (ix) the documents incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (except for the consolidated financial statements and schedules and other financial or statistical data included therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), as of the dates they were filed with the Commission or to the extent such documents were subsequently amended prior to the date hereof, at the time so amended, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder.
     In addition, such counsel shall state that such counsel has participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company and with representatives of its independent registered public accounting firm and representatives of the Underwriters and counsel to the Underwriters at which conferences the contents of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and any amendment and supplement thereto and related matters were discussed and, although such counsel has not undertaken to determine independently and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto (except as expressly provided above), no facts have come to such counsel's attention to lead such counsel to believe that (A) the Registration Statement and Prospectus (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein as to which such counsel need not comment) do not comply as to form in all material respects with the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder or the Registration Statement, at the date of this Agreement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (iii) the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto as of its date and the Closing Date contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; in each case, except for financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data as to which such counsel need not comment.
(B)(i)
     The opinions of Baker Botts L.L.P. and Jay D. Browning, Esq. referred to in paragraphs 7(f) and 7(g) above shall be rendered to the Underwriters at the request of the Company and shall so state therein.
     (h) on the date of this Agreement and on the Closing Date, KPMG LLP shall have furnished to you letters dated such dates, in form and substance satisfactory to you, containing statements and information
 
of the type customarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus; that the letter delivered on the Closing Date shall use a "cut-off" date no more than three business days prior to such Closing Date; and
provided
     (i) you shall have received on and as of the Closing Date an opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel to the Underwriters, in form and substance satisfactory to you.
     (j) The "lock up" agreements, each substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, between you and those officers who are required to file reports pursuant to Section 16 of the Exchange Act relating to sales and certain other dispositions of shares of Common Stock or certain other securities, delivered to you on or before the date hereof, shall be in full force and effect on the Closing Date.
     The several obligations of the Underwriters to purchase Additional Shares hereunder are subject to the delivery to you on the applicable Option Closing Date of such documents as you may reasonably request with respect to the good standing of the Company, the due authorization and issuance of the Additional Shares to be sold on such Option Closing Date and other matters related to the issuance of such Additional Shares.
     8. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each affiliate of any Underwriter which assists such Underwriter in the distribution of the Shares and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including without limitation the legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted) caused by (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information (or any part thereof), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
 
     Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the information identified as being provided by the Underwriters. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Shares, (ii) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Shares under the heading "Underwriting", (iii) the third paragraph of text under the heading "Underwriting", (iv) the seventh paragraph of text under the heading "Underwriting" and (v) the eleventh and twelfth paragraphs of text under the heading "Underwriting" related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
     If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing, and the Indemnifying Person, upon request of the Indemnified Person, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person or (iii) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for the Underwriters, each affiliate of any
Indemnified Person
Indemnifying Person
 
Underwriter which assists such Underwriter in the distribution of the Shares and such control persons of Underwriters shall be designated in writing by each of the named Representatives on Schedule I hereto and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and such control persons of the Company or authorized representatives shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify any Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested an Indemnifying Person to reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the third sentence of this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such Indemnifying Person of the aforesaid request and (ii) such Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
     If the indemnification provided for in the first and second paragraphs of this Section 8 is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of such Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and the commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Shares. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or
 
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective number of Firm Shares set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto, and not joint.
pro rata
     The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
     The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 8 and the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any other person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares.
     9. Notwithstanding anything herein contained, this Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company, if (a) after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the NYSE Alternext U.S. or the NASDAQ Stock Market, (ii) trading of any securities of or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking
 
activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and (b) in the case of any of the events specified in clauses 9(a)(i) through 9(a)(v), such event, singly or together with any other event, makes it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable to market the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
     10. If, on the Closing Date or an Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares which it or they have agreed to purchase under this Agreement, and the aggregate number of Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Shares, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the number of Firm Shares set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Representatives may specify, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the number of Shares that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-tenth of such number of Shares without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Firm Shares and the aggregate number of Firm Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Firm Shares to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Firm Shares are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. If, on an Option Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Additional Shares and the aggregate number of Additional Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Additional Shares to be purchased on such Option Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the option to (i) terminate their obligation hereunder to purchase the Additional Shares to be sold on such Option Closing Date or (ii) purchase not less than the number of Additional Shares that such non-defaulting Underwriters would have been obligated to purchase in the absence of such default. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
provided
 
     11. If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering of Shares.
     12. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company, each affiliate of any Underwriter which assists such Underwriter in the distribution of the Shares, the Underwriters, any controlling persons referred to herein and their respective successors and assigns. Nothing expressed or mentioned in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person, firm or corporation any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision herein contained. No purchaser of Shares from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor by reason merely of such purchase.
     13. Any action by the Underwriters hereunder may be taken by you jointly or by either of the named Representatives set forth in Schedule I hereto alone on behalf of the Underwriters, and any such action taken by you jointly or by either of the named Representatives set forth in Schedule I hereto alone shall be binding upon the Underwriters. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication. Notices to the Underwriters shall be given at the address set forth in Schedule I hereto. Notices to the Company shall be given to it at Valero Energy Corporation, One Valero Way, San Antonio, Texas 78249 (facsimile: (210) 345-3214); Attention: Corporate Secretary.
     14. This Agreement may be signed in counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
     15. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
          I am Senior Vice President-Corporate Law and Corporate Secretary of Valero Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and have acted as counsel for the Company in connection with its offering of an aggregate of 46,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Shares"), which it is offering under the Registration Statement on Form S-3ASR (Registration No. 333-157867) (as amended, the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Registration Statement relates to the proposed issuance and sale from time to time by the Company of the Shares under the Securities Act's Rule 415.
          In furnishing this opinion, I or members of my staff have examined and relied without investigation as to matters of fact upon, copies of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Restated By-laws of the Company, as amended to date; the Registration Statement and its exhibits; the prospectus included in the Registration Statement; the prospectus supplement dated June 3, 2009 and filed with the Commission on June 4, 2009 under the Securities Act's Rule 424(b)(5); the underwriting agreement, dated June 3, 2009, among the Company and Barclays Capital Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein, relating to the offering and sale of the Shares (the "Underwriting Agreement"); the resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") and a special committee of the Board which authorize the issuance of the Shares and approve the terms of the offering and sale of the Shares; corporate records of the Company, including minute books of the Company; certificates of public officials and of representatives of the Company; statutes and other instruments and documents as I have deemed necessary or appropriate to form a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed.
          In connection with this opinion, I have assumed: (a) the genuineness of all signatures on all documents examined by me and (b) the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to me as copies.
          On the basis of the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth herein, I am of the opinion that:

     2. The Shares have been duly authorized and, when issued and delivered in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement against payment therefor, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
          The opinions set forth above are limited in all respects to matters of Texas law, the Delaware General Corporation Law and the federal laws of the United States, in each instance as currently in effect, and in each case, exclusive of municipal, local and county ordinances, laws, rules and regulations.
