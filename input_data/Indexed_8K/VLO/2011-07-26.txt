Exhibit 99.01
Valero Energy Reports Second Quarter 2011 Results
SAN ANTONIO, July 26, 2011 - Valero Energy Corporation (Valero, NYSE: VLO) today reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders from continuing operations of $745 million, or $1.30 per share, for the second quarter of 2011, versus $520 million, or $0.92 per share, for the second quarter of 2010. For the six months ended June 30, 2011, net income attributable to Valero stockholders from continuing operations was $849 million, or $1.48 per share, versus $440 million, or $0.78 per share for the six months ended June 30, 2010.
Second quarter 2011 operating income was $1.3 billion versus second quarter 2010 operating income of $904 million. The increase in operating income was mainly due to an increase of $1.84 per barrel in refining throughput margin combined with an increase of 136,000 barrels per day in refining throughput volumes. The increase in throughput margin was primarily due to higher margins for gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel plus wider discounts for heavy-sour feedstocks on the Gulf Coast and light-sweet crude oil in the Mid-Continent. The increase in throughput volumes was mainly due to operating the Aruba refinery, which was not in operation during the second quarter of 2010.
Our earnings momentum continues to build, said Valero Chairman and CEO Bill Klesse. In the second quarter, refining industry margins and feedstock discounts in our markets expanded from the strong first-quarter levels as global refined product demand continued to grow. To take advantage of this demand growth, we increased refining throughput volumes to our highest utilization rate in three years - despite the impact of an apparent lightning strike to a critical motor at our Port Arthur Refinery in early June. Our entire organization is proud of our employees' efforts to quickly mobilize and mitigate the negative impact at Port Arthur to only two weeks.
Klesse continued, Our McKee, Ardmore, and Three Rivers refineries continued to benefit from processing WTI-type and Eagle Ford crude oils, which have been pricing at a significant discount to waterborne light-sweet crude oils such as Brent and LLS. We continued to increase our processing of discounted Eagle Ford crude oil at our Three Rivers refinery, and we plan to process additional volume there and at our Corpus Christi refinery in the third quarter.
Also in the second quarter, we progressed on key investments to enhance our long-term profitability. We completed the cat-cracker revamp at our St. Charles Refinery and are already seeing yield improvements. At our Memphis Refinery, a third-party oxygen line was completed. As oxygen volumes increase in August, we expect additional improvements to be realized from the Memphis cat-cracker revamp completed last year. We expect both of these projects will significantly improve our reliability performance.
Commenting on the industry outlook, Klesse said, With crude oil prices holding in a range and global economic growth continuing, refined product demand will grow. Benchmark margins in the third quarter have increased from second-quarter levels, and the forward curve shows margins are strong into 2012. We continue to see attractive opportunities to export products from our Gulf Coast refineries.

Valero's retail segment continued its record-setting performance with $135 million in operating income, which was the best second quarter in Valero's history. The increase in operating income was mainly due to higher retail fuel margins plus the Canadian retail division achieved its highest quarterly operating income on record with $48 million.
Valero's ethanol segment operating income was $64 million in the second quarter of 2011 versus $35 million in the second quarter of 2010. The increase in operating income was mainly due to an increase in production volumes to 3.4 million gallons per day, the highest quarterly production volume in company history, combined with higher gross margins.
Regarding cash flows in the second quarter of 2011, capital spending was $664 million, of which $133 million was for turnaround and catalyst expenditures. Valero paid $29 million in dividends on its common stock and paid $208 million to redeem long-term debt. Valero also spent $37 million to acquire a terminal and pipelines in eastern Kentucky, which will enable the company to expand its wholesale fuels business. Valero ended the second quarter with $4.1 billion in cash and temporary cash investments as well as $7.6 billion of total debt. For the six months ended June 30, 2011, Valero has reduced debt by approximately $700 million.
Klesse concluded, Valero has an excellent growth story over the next few years, starting with the solid margin outlook. On August 1st, we plan to close on our acquisition of the Pembroke refinery, marketing, and logistics assets in the U.K. and Ireland. Our major growth projects are on-budget and on-schedule for completion in 2012, including the two hydrocrackers and hydrogen plants that are expected to contribute significant earnings and cash flow when in operation. Those projects benefit from high crude oil and low natural gas prices plus growing global demand for diesel and gasoline, and do not depend on wide discounts for WTI-priced crude oil.
