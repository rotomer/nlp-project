Exhibit 99.01
Valero Energy Reports Third Quarter 2011 Results
SAN ANTONIO, November 1, 2011 - Valero Energy Corporation (Valero, NYSE: VLO) today reported net income from continuing operations of $1.2 billion, or $2.11 per share, for the third quarter of 2011, versus $303 million, or $0.53 per share, for the third quarter of 2010. For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, net income attributable to Valero stockholders from continuing operations was $2.1 billion, or $3.59 per share, versus $743 million, or $1.31 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2010.
Third quarter 2011 operating income was $2.0 billion versus third quarter 2010 operating income of $590 million. The increase in operating income was mainly due to an increase of $5.11 per barrel in refining throughput margin combined with an increase of 389,000 barrels per day in refining throughput volumes. The increase in throughput margin was primarily due to higher margins for diesel and jet fuel plus substantial discounts for light-sweet crude oil in the Mid-Continent and better discounts for heavy-sour feedstocks. In addition to an economic incentive from higher margins, the increase in throughput volumes was due to adding capacity from the August 1, 2011 acquisition of the Pembroke refinery plus operating the Aruba refinery, which was not in operation during the third quarter of 2010.
We achieved our best quarterly earnings per share since 2007, said Valero Chairman and CEO Bill Klesse. Our focus on improving operations and the competitiveness of our portfolio has produced solid financial results. We were able to capitalize on favorable refining margins and attain our highest refinery utilization since the third quarter of 2007.
As our strong financial results have improved our cash position, we recognize the importance of returning cash to our shareholders, Klesse continued. In the third quarter, we bought back 13.5 million shares, or two percent of shares outstanding, and our Board of Directors tripled the quarterly dividend rate last week to 15 cents per share.
Valero
s ethanol segment had a record-setting quarter with $107 million in operating income, which was the highest quarterly operating income since Valero entered the ethanol business, and compares to $47 million in the third quarter of 2010. The increase in operating income was mainly due to higher gross margins and an increase in production volumes to 3.3 million gallons per day.
Valeros retail segment continued to perform well, with $97 million in operating income during the third quarter versus third quarter 2010 operating income of $105 million. The slight decrease in operating income was mainly due to lower fuel margins and volumes in U.S. retail operations, but was somewhat offset by higher margins in Canadian retail operations.
Regarding cash flows in the third quarter of 2011, capital spending was $684 million, of which $69 million was for turnaround and catalyst expenditures. Valero paid $28 million in dividends on its common stock and paid $268 million to purchase Valeros shares. Valero also spent approximately $1.6 billion to acquire the U.K. and Ireland businesses, which included approximately $900 million

for working capital and other assets. Valero ended the third quarter with $2.8 billion in cash and temporary cash investments. Subsequent to the third quarter, Valero acquired the Meraux refinery and related logistics assets on October 1 for $586 million in cash, which included approximately $261 million for a preliminary estimate of inventories and other assets.
Klesse continued, While fourth-quarter refining margins have declined from the high levels of the second and third quarters and we are experiencing very high price volatility, crude oil prices are in a range that is supportive of global demand growth. Were also seeing continued product demand from international markets despite the economic uncertainty in Western Europe.
Commenting on strategic actions, Klesse said, We continued to make progress on our key economic growth projects, which remain on-budget and on-schedule. The hydrogen plants at Memphis and McKee should be completed by the end of 2011. The other growth projects are scheduled for completion in 2012, including the hydrocrackers at St. Charles and Port Arthur, the Montreal products pipeline, and the Diamond Green Diesel joint venture. In addition, we improved our earnings power by acquiring the U.K. and Ireland businesses, including the Pembroke refinery, and the Meraux refinery and related assets. Given our growth projects, attractive acquisitions, and operational improvements, we believe that Valero is uniquely positioned among refiners to grow earnings and cash flow per share for years to come.
