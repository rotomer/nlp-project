Exhibit 99.01
Valero Energy Reports Third Quarter 2012 Results
SAN ANTONIO, October 30, 2012 - Valero Energy Corporation (Valero, NYSE: VLO) today reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders of $674 million, or $1.21 per share, for the third quarter of 2012 compared to net income attributable to Valero stockholders of $1.2 billion, or $2.11 per share, for the third quarter of 2011. Included in the third quarter 2012 results was a noncash asset impairment loss of $341 million after taxes, or $0.62 per share, and severance expense of $41 million after taxes, or $0.07 per share, primarily related to the Aruba refinery. Excluding these items, Valero reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders of $1.1 billion, or $1.90 per share.
Third quarter 2012 operating income was $1.3 billion versus $2.0 billion of operating income in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding the items noted above, third quarter 2012 operating income was $1.7 billion. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower refining throughput margins in the U.S. Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, and West Coast, which were partially offset by significantly higher refining throughput margins in the North Atlantic region. In addition, throughput volumes at the St. Charles, Meraux, and Memphis refineries were negatively impacted by the effects of Hurricane Isaac and unplanned maintenance on the Meraux crude unit. A decline in retail and ethanol margins also contributed to the decrease in operating income.
Even with lower margins than last year, we reported solid financial results, said Valero Chairman and CEO Bill Klesse. During the third quarter, we elected to reorganize the Aruba refinery into a crude oil and refined products terminal, did major-reliability work at the Meraux refinery, and continued to pursue the separation of our retail business. The new Port Arthur hydrocracker is expected to be operational in December, and the new St. Charles hydrocracker remains on schedule to be operational in the second quarter of 2013.
Klesse continued, Looking at the fourth quarter, gasoline margins have narrowed significantly, but distillate margins and sour crude discounts remain wide. U.S. demand for refined products continues to be weak, reflecting high unemployment and high prices, but exports remain strong. As we approach winter, U.S. inventories of refined products look favorable.
Valeros retail segment reported $41 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2012 versus $97 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2011. The decrease in operating income was mainly due to lower fuel margins and volumes in the U.S. and Canada plus a noncash asset impairment of $12 million.
We are making progress on our plan to separate our retail business and unlock value for our shareholders, said Klesse. In October, we submitted our request to the Internal Revenue Service for a private letter ruling on a tax-efficient distribution of our retail business to shareholders. Later this quarter, we expect to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Given the typical timing of this process, we expect to complete the retail separation late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2013.
Valeros ethanol segment reported an operating loss of $73 million in the third quarter of 2012 versus $107 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2011. The decrease in ethanol operating income was due to significantly lower gross margins caused by a combination of high corn prices and high industry ethanol inventories attributable to lower ethanol and gasoline demand. Due to poor margins, Valero reduced production rates at several of its plants.

Regarding cash flows in the third quarter of 2012, capital spending was $784 million, of which $75 million was for turnaround and catalyst expenditures. Valero returned $97 million of cash to shareholders through dividends on its common stock and ended the third quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and temporary cash investments.
For the full-year 2012, Valero has reduced its estimate for total capital spending, including turnaround and catalyst expenditures, to $3.5 billion versus prior guidance of approximately $3.6 billion. Valero expects total capital spending for 2013 to be approximately $2.5 billion, including approximately $200 million for the retail segment and some carryover from 2012.
Valeros senior management will hold a conference call at 11 a.m. ET (10 a.m. CT) today to discuss this earnings release and provide an update on company operations. A live broadcast of the conference call will be available on the companys web site at

NOTES TO EARNINGS RELEASE
We also recognized asset impairment losses of $12 million ($8 million after taxes) related to certain retail stores in the third quarter of 2012 and $16 million ($10 million after taxes) related to equipment associated with a permanently cancelled capital project at one of our other refineries in the first quarter of 2012. The asset impairment loss related to one of our other refineries is included in refining segment operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, but it is excluded from operating costs per barrel for the refining segment and from operating income and operating costs per barrel for the U.S. Gulf Coast region.
