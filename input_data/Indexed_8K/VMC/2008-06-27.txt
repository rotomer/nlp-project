Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
a. Credit Agreements
On June 23, 2008, Vulcan Materials Company ("Vulcan", "we" or "us") entered into a $300 million Term Loan Credit Agreement (the "Term Credit Agreement") with Wachovia Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (in such capacity, the "Administrative Agent"), and the Lenders (the "Lenders") and other parties thereto.
The Term Credit Facility is senior unsecured debt of Vulcan. The Term Credit Agreement contains customary representations, affirmative and negative covenants (including limitations on liens, and a maximum consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of 0.65 to 1.00) and events of default usual for credit facilities of the type. The Term Credit Facility matures on June 23, 2011.
Proceeds of the Term Credit Facility may only be used to pay down the commitments and outstanding loans under the $2,000,000,000 364-Day Bridge Credit Agreement dated November 16, 2007 with Wachovia Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent and the Lenders and other parties thereto, and following repayment in full thereof, to refinance other outstanding indebtedness.
The loans under the Term Credit Facility bears interest at a rate equal to the Eurodollar rate plus a margin determined by reference to a ratings-based pricing grid, or the base rate at the option of Vulcan (which is defined as the higher of the Wachovia prime rate and the Federal funds rate plus 0.50%). Assuming an A-/A3 equivalent credit rating level, the applicable rate under the Term Credit Facility will be the Eurodollar rate plus 1.00%.
Certain of the Lenders and their affiliates have provided, from time to time, and may continue to provide, investment banking, commercial banking, financial and other services to us, including letters of credit, depository and account processing services, for which we have paid and intend to pay customary fees, and our pension fund also invests in funds managed by the Lenders or affiliates of the Lenders. Certain of the Lenders were parties to our prior credit agreements. Banc of America Securities LLC, an affiliate of Bank of America, N.A., a Lender, is a dealer with respect to our commercial paper program. To hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates, we have from time to time entered into transactions involving derivative instruments, such as forward starting swaps, with Bank of America, National Association, a Lender.
The foregoing description of the Term Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Term Credit Agreement, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 1.1 to this Report and is incorporated in this Report by reference.

A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
     (c) . If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Term Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this , and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the Term Loan Borrowing set forth in are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.

Obligations of Lenders Several
     (e) . Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Term Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Term Loan in any particular place or manner.

If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes or determines in its sole discretion exercised in good faith that it has obtained the benefit of a credit for Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund or the net benefit attributable to such credit (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund or credit), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund or credit), that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund or credit to such Governmental Authority.

Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans.

Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

     (iii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender;

     (b) . If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender's holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Term Loans made by or held by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
Capital Requirements

     (c) any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 10.13;
including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Term Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary out-of-pocket administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
     For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Base Rate used in determining the Eurodollar Rate for such Term Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.

principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
     (c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and
     (d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws.
     A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
