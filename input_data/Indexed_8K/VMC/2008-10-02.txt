     On October 1, 2008, the Company entered into amended and restated Change of Control Employment Agreements (the "Agreements") with executive officers of the Company and certain other key employees. These Agreements supersede and replace the existing Change of Control Employment Agreements with certain of the Company's executive officers and key employees. The amendments made to the new Agreements are those required to bring the Agreements into compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Section 409A regulates all non-qualified deferred compensation plans.
     The Agreements are either a double-trigger (the "Double-Trigger Agreements") or a modified double trigger (the "Modified Double-Trigger Agreements"). The Double Trigger Agreement provides that upon a Change of Control, as defined below, if an executive officer or key employee covered by the Agreements is terminated without cause or constructively terminated during the 24 month period following the Change in Control, the executive is entitled to severance. The Modified Double Trigger Agreements allow an executive to terminate for any reason during the 30-day period following the first anniversary of the Change of Control event and receive severance. Modified Double Trigger Agreements apply to three executives, including Donald M. James, CEO, and Daniel F. Sansone, CFO. Double Trigger Agreements apply to all other covered executives and key employees, including Guy M. Badgett, III and Ronald G. McAbee, who were named executive officers.
     The severance payable pursuant to the Agreements is three times the sum of base, bonus and long-term incentive awards; the payment of a pro rata annual bonus in the year of termination; and the continuation of health, medical and other fringe benefits for a period of years following such termination. The Agreements generally provide for "gross up" payments to compensate the executives for any excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
     Under the Agreements, a Change of Control is defined as: (a) the acquisition by any individual entity or group of 20% or more of the then outstanding or voting shares of the Company; (b) a change in the majority membership of the Board of Directors; or (c) consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company's assets unless the Company's shareholders before such business combination or sale own more than 60% of the outstanding common stock following the business combination or sale. This definition of a Change of Control is the same as in the original Change of Control Employment Agreements which have now been superseded.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant had duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 10.1
     by and between Vulcan Materials Company, a New Jersey corporation (the "Company") and (the "Executive"), dated as of the day of , 2008.

___
                     
                    
     The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of the Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below) of the Company. The Board believes it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change of Control and to encourage the Executive's full attention and dedication to the Company currently and in the event of any threatened or pending Change of Control, and to provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change of Control which ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of the Executive will be satisfied and which are competitive with those of other corporations. Therefore, in order to accomplish these objectives, the Board has caused the Company to enter into this Agreement.
     1. (a) The "Effective Date" shall mean the first date during the Change of Control Period (as defined in Section 1(b)) on which a Change of Control (as defined in Section 2) occurs. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if a Change of Control occurs and if the Executive's employment with the Company is terminated prior to the date on which the Change of Control occurs, and if it is reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such termination of employment (i) was at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or anticipation of a Change of Control, then for all purposes of this Agreement the "Effective Date" shall mean the date immediately prior to the date of such termination of employment.
Certain Definitions
.
     (b) The "Change of Control Period" shall mean the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the third anniversary of the date hereof; provided, however, that commencing on the date one year after the date hereof, and on each annual anniversary of such date (such date and each annual anniversary thereof shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Renewal Date"), unless previously terminated, the Change of Control Period shall be automatically extended so as to terminate three years from such Renewal Date, unless at least 60 days prior to the Renewal Date the Company shall give notice to the Executive that the Change of Control Period shall not be so extended.
 
     2. For the purpose of this Agreement, a "Change of Control" shall mean:

     (b) Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board; or
     (c) Consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (a "Business Combination"), in each case, unless, following such Business Combination, (i) all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 60% of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as the case may be, of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination (including, without limitation, a corporation which as a result of such transaction owns the Company or all or substantially all of the Company's assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such Business Combination of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case may be, (ii) no Person (excluding any corporation resulting from such Business Combination or any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or such corporation resulting from such Business Combination) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination or the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation except to the extent that such ownership existed prior to the Business Combination and (iii) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement, or of the action of the Board, providing for such Business Combination; or

Cause
.
     (i) the willful and continued failure of the Executive to perform substantially the Executive's duties with the Company or one of its affiliates (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Executive by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or Chief Executive Officer believes that the Executive has not substantially performed the Executive's duties, or
     (ii) the willful engaging by the Executive in illegal conduct which is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company.
     For purposes of this provision, no act or failure to act, on the part of the Executive, shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or a senior officer of the Company or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. The cessation of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Executive and the Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive is guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
     (c) The Executive's employment may be terminated by the Executive for Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean:

     (ii) A material diminution in the Executive's authority, duties, or responsibilities or a material diminution in the authority, duties, or responsibilities of the supervisor to whom the Executive is required to report;
     (iii) A material change in the geographic location at which the Executive must perform services, provided that a change in office or location permitted under Section 4(a)(i)(B) shall not be considered material for this purpose;
     (iv) A material diminution in the budget over which the Executive retains authority; or
     (v) Any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company of this Agreement.
     (d) Any termination by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto given in accordance with Section 12(b) of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of
Notice of Termination
.
 
Termination" means a written notice which (i) indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) to the extent applicable, sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated (including, in the case of a termination for Good Reason, the condition constituting Good Reason) and (iii) if the date on which the termination will become effective is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the termination date (which date shall be not more than thirty days after the giving of such notice, except in the case of a termination for Good Reason, notice shall be not more than 90 days before the termination date). The Executive's employment shall be terminated for Good Reason only if the Executive provides a Notice of Termination to the Company within 90 days of the initial existence of the condition constituting Good Reason and the Company fails to remedy the condition within 30 days of receipt of the Notice of Termination. Except as provided in the preceding sentence with respect to termination for Good Reason, the failure by the Executive or the Company to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes to a showing of Good Reason or Cause shall not waive any right of the Executive or the Company, respectively, hereunder or preclude the Executive or the Company, respectively, from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing the Executive's or the Company's rights hereunder.
     (e)  "Date of Termination" means the date on which the Executive incurs a separation from service with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

     C. an amount equal to the excess of (a) the actuarial equivalent of the benefit under the Company's qualified defined benefit retirement plan (the "Retirement Plan") (utilizing actuarial
 
assumptions no less favorable to the Executive than those in effect under the Company's Retirement Plan immediately prior to the Effective Date), and the Unfunded Supplemental Benefit Plan for Salaried Employees or its successor plan or any other excess or supplemental retirement plan in which the Executive participates (together, the "SERP") which the Executive would receive if the Executive's employment continued for three years after the Date of Termination assuming for this purpose that all accrued benefits are fully vested, and, assuming that the Executive's compensation in each of the three years is that required by Section 4(b)(i) and Section 4(b)(ii), over (b) the actuarial equivalent of the Executive's actual benefit (paid or payable), if any, under the Retirement Plan and the SERP as of the Date of Termination; and
     D. an amount equal to the additional Company matching contributions that would have been made on the Executive's behalf in the Company's Thrift Plan for Salaried Employees or any successor plan (the "Thrift Plan") (assuming continued participation on the same basis as immediately prior to the Effective Date), plus the additional amount of any benefit the Executive would have accrued under the SERP as a result of contribution limitations in the Thrift Plan, which the Executive would receive if the Executive's employment continued for three years after the Date of Termination, assuming for this purpose that the Executive's compensation in each of the three years is that required by Section 4(b)(i) and Section 4(b)(ii) and that the Company's matching contributions are determined pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Thrift Plan and the SERP, as in effect during the 12-month period immediately prior to the Effective Date; and

For purposes of determining eligibility (but not the time of commencement of benefits) of the Executive for retiree benefits pursuant to such plans, practices, programs and policies, the Executive shall be considered to have remained employed until three years after the Date of Termination and to have retired on the last day of such period; and
     (iii) for three years after the Executive's Date of Termination, or such longer period as may be provided by the terms of the appropriate plan, program, practice or policy, the Company shall continue to provide to the Executive and/or the Executive's family fringe benefits at least equal to those which would have been provided to them in accordance with the plans, programs, practices and policies described in Section 4(b)(vii) of this Agreement if the Executive's employment had not been terminated or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies and their families, subject to the payment requirements of paragraph (viii), below; and

     (v) the Company shall, at its sole expense as incurred, provide the Executive with outplacement services the scope and provider of which shall be selected by the Executive in his sole discretion, provided that the aggregate cost of such services shall not exceed $50,000, and provided that (A) such expense shall not be incurred later than the last day of the second taxable year of the Executive following the Date of Termination, (B) any reimbursement for such expenses shall not be paid to the Executive later than the last day of the third taxable year of the Executive following the Date of Termination, and (C) the amount of such expenses shall not exceed the amount of "reasonable outplacement expenses," as determined under Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(9)(v)(A); and
     (vi) amounts credited to the Executive's account under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan shall be paid in the manner and at the time specified under that plan; and
     (vii) to the extent not theretofore paid or provided, the Company shall timely pay or provide to the Executive any other amounts or benefits required to be paid or provided or which the Executive is eligible to receive under any plan, program, policy or practice or contract or agreement of the Company and its affiliated companies (such other amounts and benefits shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Other Benefits"), subject to the payment requirements of paragraph (viii), below; and
     (viii) to the extent that any coverage, payments, reimbursements or in-kind benefits provided under paragraph (ii), (iii), or (vii) this Section 6(a) would be includable in the Executive's gross income for federal income tax purposes (such benefits, together, shall be hereinafter referred to as "Specified Benefits"), the following rules shall apply:
A. any Specified Benefit that would otherwise be paid in the first six months following the Date of Termination shall instead be paid in the seventh month following the Date of Termination, except as provided below;
B. the six-month delay in A., above, shall not apply to any Specified Benefit that is required to be paid no later than the 15th day of the third month following the end of the Executive's taxable year in which the Date of Termination occurs, and, for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, any Specified Benefits required to be paid no later than the 15th day of the third month following the end of the Executive's taxable year in which the Date of Termination occurs are considered to be separate payments from all other Specified Benefits;
C. the six-month delay in A., above, shall not apply to any Specified Benefits that are (1) reimbursements or in-kind benefits that the Executive could otherwise deduct as business expenses under Sections 162 or 167 of the Code (disregarding limitations based on adjusted gross income) or (2) reimbursements of medical expenses that meet the following requirements: (x) the expenses are incurred and paid by the Executive (or incurred by the Executive and paid by the Company directly to the service provider on the Executive's behalf); (y) the expenses would be allowable as a deduction to the Executive under Section 213 of the Code (disregarding the requirement that the deduction under that section apply only to expenses that exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income); and (z) the expenses are not reimbursed from a source other than the
 
Company; and
D. the six-month delay in A. above, shall not apply to the extent that any Specified Benefit that (1) is due only upon an involuntary termination (as defined in Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(n)), that (2) would otherwise be subject to the delay (after taking into account B and C, above), and that (3) when combined with all other such payments, falls below the amount specified in Treas. Reg.  1.409A1(b)(9)(iii)(A) (generally the lesser of two times the Executive's average pay or two times the compensation limit in Section 401(a)(17) of the Code).

Full Settlement
.
     9. 
Certain Additional Payments by the Company
.
     (a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company or its affiliates to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Section 9) (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that after
 
payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9(a), if it shall be determined that the Executive is entitled to a Gross-Up Payment, but that the Executive, after taking into account the Payments and the Gross-Up Payment, would not receive a net after-tax benefit of at least $50,000 (taking into account both income taxes and any Excise Tax) as compared to the net after-tax proceeds to the Executive resulting from an elimination of the Gross-Up Payment and a reduction of the Payment, in the aggregate, to an amount (the "Reduced Amount") such that the receipt of the Payments would not give rise to any Excise Tax, then no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to the Executive and the Payments, in the aggregate, shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount. The Gross-Up Payment, if any, will be paid no later than the end of the Executive's taxable year next following the Executive's taxable year in which the Excise Tax is paid and no earlier than the seventh month following the Date of Termination.
     (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 9(c), all determinations required to be made under this Section 9, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by Deloitte & Touche LLP or such other certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Executive (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change of Control, the Executive shall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Section 9, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made ("Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 9(c) and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive.
     (c) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but no later than ten business days after the Executive is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which it gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:
     (i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim,
     (ii) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,
 
     (iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim, and
     (iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim;
provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 9(c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole option, either direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts,
     as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that if the Company directs the Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive, on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; and further provided that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.
     (d) If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 9(c), the Executive becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of Section 9(c)) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 9(c), a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.
     10. The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company all secret or confidential information, knowledge or data relating to the Company or any of its affiliated companies, and their respective businesses, which shall have been obtained by the Executive during the Executive's employment by the Company or any of its affiliated companies and which shall not be or become public knowledge (other than by acts by the Executive or representatives of the Executive in violation of this Agreement). After termination of the Executive's employment with the Company, the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company or as may otherwise be required by law
Confidential Information
.
 
or legal process, communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company and those designated by it. In no event shall an asserted violation of the provisions of this Section 10 constitute a basis for deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement.
     11. (a) This Agreement is personal to the Executive and without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by the Executive otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's legal representatives.
Successors
.
     (b) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.
     (c) The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to assume expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law, or otherwise.
     12. (a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey without reference to principles of conflict of laws. The captions of this Agreement are not part of the provisions hereof and shall have no force or effect. This Agreement may not be amended or modified otherwise than by a written agreement executed by the parties hereto or their respective successors and legal representatives.

     The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of the Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below) of the Company. The Board believes it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change of Control and to encourage the Executive's full attention and dedication to the Company currently and in the event of any threatened or pending Change of Control, and to provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change of Control which ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of the Executive will be satisfied and which are competitive with those of other corporations. Therefore, in order to accomplish these objectives, the Board has caused the Company to enter into this Agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS:
     1. (a) The "Effective Date" shall mean the first date during the Change of Control Period (as defined in Section 1(b)) on which a Change of Control (as defined in Section 2) occurs. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if a Change of Control occurs and if the Executive's employment with the Company is terminated prior to the date on which the Change of Control occurs, and if it is reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such termination of employment (i) was at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or anticipation of a Change of Control, then for all purposes of this Agreement the "Effective Date" shall mean the date immediately prior to the date of such termination of employment.

     (b) The "Change of Control Period" shall mean the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the third anniversary of the date hereof; provided, however, that commencing on the date one year after the date hereof, and on each annual anniversary of such date (such date and each annual anniversary thereof shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Renewal Date"), unless previously terminated, the Change of Control Period shall be automatically extended so as to terminate three years from such Renewal Date, unless at least 60 days prior to the Renewal Date the Company shall give notice to the Executive that the Change of Control Period shall not be so extended.

     (i) the willful and continued failure of the Executive to perform substantially the Executive's duties with the Company or one of its affiliates (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Executive by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or Chief Executive Officer believes that the Executive has not substantially performed the Executive's duties, or
 
     (ii) the willful engaging by the Executive in illegal conduct which is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company. For purposes of this provision, no act or failure to act, on the part of the Executive, shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or a senior officer of the Company or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. The cessation of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Executive and the Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive is guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
     (c) The Executive's employment may be terminated by the Executive for Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean:
Good Reason
.
     (i) the assignment to the Executive of any duties inconsistent in any respect with the Executive's position (including status, offices, titles and reporting requirements), authority, duties or responsibilities as contemplated by Section 4(a) of this Agreement, or any other action by the Company which results in a diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities, excluding for this purpose an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith and which is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive;
     (ii) any failure by the Company to comply with any of the provisions of Section 4(b) of this Agreement, other than an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent failure not occurring in bad faith and which is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive;
     (iii) the Company's requiring the Executive to be based at any office or location other than as provided in Section 4(a)(i)(B) hereof or the Company's requiring the Executive to travel on Company business to a substantially greater extent than required immediately prior to the Effective Date;
     (iv) any purported termination by the Company of the Executive's employment otherwise than as expressly permitted by this Agreement; or
     (v) any failure by the Company to comply with and satisfy Section 11(c) of this Agreement. For purposes of this Section 5(c), any good faith determination of "Good Reason" made by the Executive shall be conclusive. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, a termination by the Executive for any reason during the 30-day period immediately following the first anniversary of the Effective Date shall be deemed to be a termination for Good Reason for all purposes of this Agreement (the "30-day Window Trigger"); provided, however, that, in the event, a resolution is duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement, or of the action of the Board, providing for such Business Combination, finding that, in the good faith
 
opinion of such Incumbent Board, the Company is or will be the surviving corporation following the occurrence of a Change of Control event described in Section 2(c) hereof, the 30-day Window Trigger shall be inapplicable.
     (d) Any termination by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto given in accordance with Section 12(b) of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means a written notice which (i) indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) to the extent applicable, sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated and (iii) if the date on which the termination will become effective is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the termination date (which date shall be not more than thirty days after the giving of such notice). The failure by the Executive or the Company to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes to a showing of Good Reason or Cause shall not waive any right of the Executive or the Company, respectively, hereunder or preclude the Executive or the Company, respectively, from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing the Executive's or the Company's rights hereunder.
Notice of Termination
.
     (e) "Date of Termination" means the date on which the Executive incurs a separation from service with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
Date of Termination
.
     6. (a) Good Reason; Other Than for Cause, Death or Disability. If, during the Employment Period, the Company shall terminate the Executive's employment other than for Cause or Disability or the Executive shall terminate employment for Good Reason:
Obligations of the Company upon Termination
.
     (i) the Company shall pay to the Executive in cash the aggregate of the following amounts, and such amounts shall be paid in a lump sum in the seventh month following the Date of Termination except that the "Accrued Obligations" (as defined below) shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days after the Date of Termination:
     A. the sum of (1) the Executive's Annual Base Salary through the Date of Termination to the extent not theretofore paid, (2) the product of (x) the higher of (I) the Annual Bonus for the full fiscal year in which the Date of Termination occurs, determined based on actual individual and corporate performance through the Date of Termination, and (II) the Recent Annual Bonus (provided that this clause (II) shall not apply if a Change in Control does not occur before the payment date for the lump sum payment described in this Section 6(a)(i)) and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the current fiscal year through the Date of Termination, and the denominator of which is 365, to the extent not theretofore paid and (3) any accrued vacation pay, in each case to the extent not theretofore paid (the sum of the amounts described in clauses (1), (2), and (3) shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Accrued Obligations"); and
     B. the amount equal to the product of (1) three and (2) the sum of (x) the Executive's Annual Base Salary, (y) the higher of (I) the Annual Bonus for the full fiscal year in which the Date of Termination occurs, determined based on actual individual and corporate performance through the Date of Termination and (II) the Recent Annual Bonus and (z) the aggregate dollar value of the annual long-term incentive awards granted to the Executive as determined in accordance with the Company's
 
policies and procedures for determining annual long-term incentive awards as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date based on the Executive's Annual Base Salary and the Executive's annual long-term incentive award percentage in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date for the fiscal year in which the Effective Date occurs; and
     C. an amount equal to the excess of (a) the actuarial equivalent of the benefit under the Company's qualified defined benefit retirement plan (the "Retirement Plan") (utilizing actuarial assumptions no less favorable to the Executive than those in effect under the Company's Retirement Plan immediately prior to the Effective Date), and the Unfunded Supplemental Benefit Plan for Salaried Employees or its successor plan or any other excess or supplemental retirement plan in which the Executive participates (together, the "SERP") which the Executive would receive if the Executive's employment continued for three years after the Date of Termination assuming for this purpose that all accrued benefits are fully vested, and, assuming that the Executive's compensation in each of the three years is that required by Section 4(b)(i) and Section 4(b)(ii), over (b) the actuarial equivalent of the Executive's actual benefit (paid or payable), if any, under the Retirement Plan and the SERP as of the Date of Termination; and
     D. an amount equal to the additional Company matching contributions that would have been made on the Executive's behalf in the Company's Thrift Plan for Salaried Employees or any successor plan (the "Thrift Plan") (assuming continued participation on the same basis as immediately prior to the Effective Date), plus the additional amount of any benefit the Executive would have accrued under the SERP as a result of contribution limitations in the Thrift Plan, which the Executive would receive if the Executive's employment continued for three years after the Date of Termination, assuming for this purpose that the Executive's compensation in each of the three years is that required by Section 4(b)(i) and Section 4(b)(ii) and that the Company's matching contributions are determined pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Thrift Plan and the SERP, as in effect during the 12-month period immediately prior to the Effective Date; and
     (ii) for three years after the Executive's Date of Termination, or such longer period as may be provided by the terms of the appropriate plan, program, practice or policy, the Company shall continue benefits to the Executive and/or the Executive's family at least equal to those which would have been provided to them in accordance with the plans, programs, practices and policies described in Section 4(b)(v) of this Agreement if the Executive's employment had not been terminated or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies and their families, subject to the payment requirements of paragraph (viii), below; provided, however, that if the Executive becomes reemployed with another employer and is eligible to receive medical or other welfare benefits under another employer provided plan, the medical and other welfare benefits described herein shall be secondary to those provided under such other plan during such applicable period of eligibility. For purposes of determining eligibility (but not the time of commencement of benefits) of the Executive for retiree benefits pursuant to such plans, practices, programs and policies, the Executive shall be considered to have remained employed until three years after the Date of Termination and to have retired on the last day of such period; and
     (iii) for three years after the Executive's Date of Termination, or such longer period as may be provided by the terms of the appropriate plan, program, practice or policy, the Company shall continue to provide to the Executive and/or the Executive's family fringe benefits at least equal to those which would have been provided to them in accordance with the plans, programs, practices and
 
policies described in Section 4(b)(vii) of this Agreement if the Executive's employment had not been terminated or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies and their families, subject to the payment requirements of paragraph (viii), below; and
     (iv) upon the Date of Termination, the Executive shall have the right and option to purchase the automobile which the Company was providing to the Executive immediately prior to the Date of Termination in accordance with the Company's practice for retiring employees as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date (provided that, to the extent such option results in a benefit that is includable in the Executive's gross income for federal income tax purposes and such taxable amount exceeds the amount specified in Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(9)(v)(D) (i.e., generally the limit under Section 402(g) of the Code), such purchase must occur, if at all, in the seventh month following the Date of Termination).
     (v) the Company shall, at its sole expense as incurred, provide the Executive with outplacement services the scope and provider of which shall be selected by the Executive in his sole discretion, provided that the aggregate cost of such services shall not exceed $50,000, and provided that (A) such expense shall not be incurred later than the last day of the second taxable year of the Executive following the Date of Termination, (B) any reimbursement for such expenses shall not be paid to the Executive later than the last day of the third taxable year of the Executive following the Date of Termination, and (C) the amount of such expenses shall not exceed the amount of "reasonable outplacement expenses," as determined under Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(9)(v)(A); and
     (vi) amounts credited to the Executive's account under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan shall be paid in the manner and at the time specified under that plan; and
     (vii) to the extent not theretofore paid or provided, the Company shall timely pay or provide to the Executive any other amounts or benefits required to be paid or provided or which the Executive is eligible to receive under any plan, program, policy or practice or contract or agreement of the Company and its affiliated companies (such other amounts and benefits shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Other Benefits"), subject to the payment requirements of paragraph (viii), below; and
     (viii) to the extent that any coverage, payments, reimbursements or in-kind benefits provided under paragraph (ii), (iii), or (vii) this Section 6(a) would be includable in the Executive's gross income for federal income tax purposes (such benefits, together, shall be hereinafter referred to as "Specified Benefits"), and would otherwise be paid in the first six months following the Date of Termination, such Specified Benefits shall instead be paid in the seventh month following the Date of Termination, unless such Specified Benefits are:
     A. reimbursements or in-kind benefits that the Executive could otherwise deduct as business expenses under Sections 162 or 167 of the Code (disregarding limitations based on adjusted gross income); or
     B. reimbursements of medical expenses that meet the following requirements: (1) the expenses are incurred and paid by the Executive (or incurred by the Executive and paid by the Company directly to the service provider on the Executive's behalf); (2) the expenses would be allowable as a deduction to the Executive under Section 213 of the Code (disregarding the requirement
 
that the deduction under that section apply only to expenses that exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income); and (3) the expenses are not reimbursed from a source other than the Company.
     (b) If the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of the Executive's death during the Employment Period, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive's legal representatives under this Agreement, other than for payment of Accrued Obligations and the timely payment or provision of Other Benefits. Accrued Obligations shall be paid to the Executive's estate or beneficiary, as applicable, in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination. With respect to the provision of Other Benefits, the term Other Benefits as utilized in this Section 6(b) shall include, without limitation, and the Executive's estate and/or beneficiaries shall be entitled to receive, benefits at least equal to the most favorable benefits provided by the Company and affiliated companies to the estates and beneficiaries of peer executives of the Company and such affiliated companies under such plans, programs, practices and policies relating to death benefits, if any, as in effect with respect to other peer executives and their beneficiaries at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Executive's estate and/or the Executive's beneficiaries, as in effect on the date of the Executive's death with respect to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies and their beneficiaries.
Death
.
     (c) If the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of the Executive's Disability during the Employment Period, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive under this Agreement, other than for payment of Accrued Obligations and the timely payment or provision of Other Benefits (subject to the six-month delay as described in subsection 6(a)(viii)). Accrued Obligations shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination. With respect to the provision of Other Benefits, the term Other Benefits as utilized in this Section 6(c) shall include, and the Executive shall be entitled after the Disability Effective Date to receive, disability and other benefits at least equal to the most favorable of those generally provided by the Company and its affiliated companies to disabled executives and/or their families in accordance with such plans, programs, practices and policies relating to disability, if any, as in effect generally with respect to other peer executives and their families at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Executive and/or the Executive's family, as in effect at any time thereafter generally with respect to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies and their families.
Disability
.
     (d) If the Executive's employment shall be terminated for Cause during the Employment Period, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive other than the obligation to pay to the Executive (x) his Annual Base Salary through the Date of Termination, (y) any amount of any compensation previously deferred by the Executive under the EDCP (which shall be paid in accordance with the terms of the EDCP), and (z) Other Benefits (subject to the six-month delay as described in subsection 6(a)(viii)), in each case to the extent theretofore unpaid. If the Executive voluntarily terminates employment during the Employment Period, excluding a termination for Good Reason, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive under this Agreement, other than for Accrued Obligations and the timely payment or provision of Other Benefits. In such case, all Accrued Obligations shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination.
Cause; Other than for Good Reason
.
     7.  Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing or future participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by the Company or any of its affiliated companies and for which the Executive may qualify, nor, subject to
Non-exclusivity of Rights.
 
Section 12(f), shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the Executive may have under any contract or agreement with the Company or any of its affiliated companies. Amounts which are vested benefits or which the Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan, policy, practice or program of or any contract or agreement with the Company or any of its affiliated companies at or subsequent to the Date of Termination shall be payable in accordance with such plan, policy, practice or program or contract or agreement except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.
     8. The Company's obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which the Company may have against the Executive or others. In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement and such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other employment. The Company agrees to pay as incurred, to the full extent permitted by law, all legal fees and expenses which the Executive may reasonably incur as a result of any contest (regardless of the outcome thereof) by the Company, the Executive or others of the validity or enforceability of, or liability under, any provision of this Agreement or any guarantee of performance thereof (including as a result of any contest by the Executive about the amount of any payment pursuant to this Agreement), plus in each case interest on any delayed payment at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the "Code". Any reimbursement of legal fees paid to the Executive pursuant to this Section 8 shall be paid no later than the end of the Executive's taxable year next following the Executive's taxable year of the Executive in which the related expense is incurred, and, if paid on account of a separation from service, no earlier than the seventh month following the Executive's separation from service.
Full Settlement
.
     9. (a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company or its affiliates to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Section 9) (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9(a), if it shall be determined that the Executive is entitled to a Gross-Up Payment, but that the Executive, after taking into account the Payments and the Gross-Up Payment, would not receive a net after-tax benefit of at least $50,000 (taking into account both income taxes and any Excise Tax) as compared to the net after-tax proceeds to the Executive resulting from an elimination of the Gross-Up Payment and a reduction of the Payment, in the aggregate, to an amount (the "Reduced Amount") such that the receipt of the Payments would not give rise to any Excise Tax, then no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to the Executive and the Payments, in the aggregate, shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount. The Gross-Up Payment, if any, will be paid no later than the end of the Executive's taxable year next following the Executive's taxable year in which the Excise Tax is paid and no earlier than the seventh month following the Date of Termination.
Certain Additional Payments by the Company
.
 
     (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 9(c), all determinations required to be made under this Section 9, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by Deloitte & Touche LLP or such other certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Executive (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change of Control, the Executive shall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Section 9, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made ("Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 9(c) and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive.
     (c) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but no later than ten business days after the Executive is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which it gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:
     (i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim,
     (ii) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,
     (iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim, and
     (iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim; provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and
 
expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 9(c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole option, either direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that if the Company directs the Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive, on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; and further provided that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.
     (d) If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 9(c), the Executive becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of Section 9(c)) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 9(c), a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.
     10. The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company all secret or confidential information, knowledge or data relating to the Company or any of its affiliated companies, and their respective businesses, which shall have been obtained by the Executive during the Executive's employment by the Company or any of its affiliated companies and which shall not be or become public knowledge (other than by acts by the Executive or representatives of the Executive in violation of this Agreement). After termination of the Executive's employment with the Company, the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company and those designated by it. In no event shall an asserted violation of the provisions of this Section 10 constitute a basis for deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement.
Confidential Information
.
     11. (a) This Agreement is personal to the Executive and without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by the Executive otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's legal representatives.
Successors
.
     (b) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.
 
     (c) The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to assume expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law, or otherwise.
     12. (a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey without reference to principles of conflict of laws. The captions of this Agreement are not part of the provisions hereof and shall have no force or effect. This Agreement may not be amended or modified otherwise than by a written agreement executed by the parties hereto or their respective successors and legal representatives.

of the Executive by the Company is "at will" and, subject to Section 1(a) hereof, prior to the Effective Date, the Executive's employment and/or this Agreement may be terminated by either the Executive or the Company at any time prior to the Effective Date, in which case the Executive shall have no further rights under this Agreement; provided, that this Agreement may not be terminated by the Company if it is reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such termination (i) was at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or anticipation of a Change of Control. From and after the Effective Date this Agreement shall supersede any other agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
