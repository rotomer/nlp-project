At Vulcan's option, any loan under the 364-Day Credit Agreement (other than Competitive Bid Loans) will bear interest at a rate equal to (i) LIBOR the Applicable Margin (defined as the Credit Default Swap Spread, subject to minimum and maximum levels based on reference to a ratings-based pricing grid), or (ii) the Base Rate the Applicable Margin. The Base Rate for any day is equal to the highest of (i) the Bank of America prime rate for such day, (ii) the Federal Fund Rate for such day .50%, and (iii) except during a Eurodollar Unavailability Period, the one month LIBOR, in each case the Applicable Margin, plus the Market Disruption Spread (defined as 1.50% per annum), if any.

3.03 Inability to Determine Rates.
     (a) If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof or any request for a Base Rate Loan or a LIBOR Floating Rate Loan that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan or in connection with a LIBOR Floating Rate Loan or a Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to the Alternative Base Rate, or (iii) the Eurodollar Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan or in connection with a Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans, LIBOR Floating Rate Loans and Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to the Alternative Base Rate shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or LIBOR Floating Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed
 
Borrowing of Base Rate Loans (as to which the rate of interest is not determined with reference to the Alternative Base Rate) in the amount specified therein.
     (b) If the Required Lenders determine that the Eurodollar Rate, the Alternative Base Rate or the LIBOR Daily Floating Rate, as the case may be, will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified in a certificate by each such Lender, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error; that such determinations are made on a reasonable basis) of making or maintaining their affected Loans, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter and, upon delivery of such notice and all such certificates and for a period of 30 days thereafter, the Market Disruption Spread, without duplication of any other costs or compensation under this , shall be included in the calculation of the Eurodollar Rate, the Alternative Base Rate and the LIBOR Daily Floating Rate.

Delay in Requests
provided
     Upon written request of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent, which shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amounts), from time to time, but without duplication of any other costs or compensation under this , the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:

     (b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan or a LIBOR Floating Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or
     (c) any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to ;

The Borrower shall also pay any customary out-of-pocket administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
 
     For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this , each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Base Rate used in determining the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.

General Provisions
 
EXHIBIT F-1
 
      
To the Banks and the Administrative Agent Referred to Below
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as in-house counsel to Vulcan Materials Company, a New Jersey corporation (the "Borrower") in connection with the 364-Day Credit Agreement dated as of November 14, 2008, among the Borrower, the banks listed on the signature pages thereof and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent and the Lenders party thereto (the "Credit Agreement"). Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
     We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law as we have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion. The Credit Agreement, the Notes and the Loan Documents are herein referred to as the "Subject Documents". In rendering the opinions expressed herein, we have assumed (i) the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Subject Documents by each of the parties thereto (other than the Borrower); and (ii) that the Subject Documents are the legal, binding, and enforceable obligation of each party (other than the Borrower).
     Upon the basis of the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
     1. The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of New Jersey and has all corporate powers required to carry on its business as now conducted.
     2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes (i) are within the Borrower's corporate powers, (ii) have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, (iii) require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official, except as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect, (iv) do not contravene, or constitute a default, under any provision of applicable law or regulation or of any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other instrument which to our knowledge is binding upon the Borrower, (v) do not contravene, or constitute a default under any provision of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Borrower and (vi) to our knowledge, except as provided in the Credit Agreement, do not result in
 
To the Banks and the Administrative Agent November 17, 2008 Page 2
the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, except in each case referred to in clauses (iv) or (vi) to the extent such contravention or default would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
     3. Except as disclosed in any SEC filings of the Borrower made prior to the Closing Date, there is no action, suit or proceeding pending, or to the knowledge of the Borrower threatened in writing, against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or which in any manner draws into question the validity of or which involves the Subject Documents.
     4. The Borrower is not and is not required to be registered an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
     5. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is a "holding company", or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company", or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company", as such terms are defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.
     6. The choice of New York law to govern the Subject Documents in which such choice is stipulated is a valid and effective choice of law under the laws of the State of Alabama, and adherence to existing judicial precedents generally would require a court sitting in the State of Alabama to abide by such choice of law, unless a fundamental policy of the State of Alabama would be violated. We are not aware of any provision of the Subject Documents which would violate a fundamental policy of the State of Alabama.
     We are qualified to practice in the State of Alabama and do not purport to be experts on any laws other than the laws of the United States and the State of Alabama in each case in effect on the date hereof (the "Subject Laws") and this opinion is rendered only with respect to such laws. We have made no independent investigation of the laws of any other jurisdiction. To the extent the Subject Documents purport to be governed by laws other than those of the State of Alabama, we have assumed that such laws are the same as the laws of the State of Alabama.
     The opinion expressed above is subject to the following qualifications and comments:
     a. Our opinion is subject to the effect of (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief, and (ii) the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
     b. We express no opinion as to the effect of any Subject Laws (including Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code) regarding fraudulent transfers or fraudulent conveyances, or restricting
 
To the Banks and the Administrative Agent November 17, 2008 Page 3
dividends, loans or distributions by a corporation or limited liability company to or for the benefit of its stockholders or members.
     c. We express no opinion as to the effect of compliance or non-compliance by the Borrower with any Subject Laws or other laws or regulations applicable to the Borrower or the transactions contemplated by the Subject Documents because of the nature of the business of the Borrower and its subsidiaries.
     d. We express no opinion with respect to the validity or enforceability of: (i) any provision in the Subject Documents relating to delay or omission of enforcement of rights or remedies, waivers of defenses, waivers of notices, or waivers of benefits of usury, appraisement, valuation, stay, extension, moratorium, redemption, statutes of limitation or other non-waivable benefits bestowed by operation of law, (ii) any exculpation clauses, clauses relating to releases of unmatured claims, clauses purporting to waive unmatured rights, severability clauses, and clauses similar in substance or nature to those described in the foregoing clause (i) and this clause (ii); (iii) any indemnification or contribution provisions set forth in the Subject Documents to the extent they purport to relate to liabilities resulting from or based upon a party's own gross negligence or willful misconduct or any violation of federal or state securities or blue sky laws; or (iv) any provisions in the Subject Documents which subject the Borrower to any claim for deficiency resulting from a judgment being rendered in a currency other than the currency called for in the Subject Documents.
     e. The provisions of the Subject Documents that permit the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to take action or make determinations, or to benefit from indemnities and similar undertakings of the Borrower, may be subject to a requirement that such action, inaction or determination by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders that may give rise to a request for payment under such an undertaking be taken or made, or not taken or made, on a reasonable basis and in good faith and may also be subject to public policy and equitable limitations.
     f. We express no opinion as to (i) whether a federal, state or any other court outside of the State of Alabama would give effect to the choice of New York law provided for in the Subject Documents, (ii) provisions of the Subject Documents that relate to the subject matter jurisdiction of any federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City to adjudicate any controversy related to the Subject Documents, or the transactions contemplated thereby, (iii) any waiver of objections to venue, inconvenient forum, or the like set forth in the Credit Agreement, (iv) the waiver of jury trial set forth in the Credit Agreement or (v) the effect (if any) of any law of any jurisdiction (except the State of Alabama) in which any enforcement of the Subject Documents may be sought.
     g. We express no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any jurisdiction (other than the laws of the State of Alabama) wherein any Lender may be located which limit rates of interest that may be charged or collected by such Lender.
     h. We express no opinion with respect to any provisions of the Subject Documents insofar as they purport to create rights of set-off: (i) against deposits and indebtedness held or
 
To the Banks and the Administrative Agent November 17, 2008 Page 4
owing by persons other than the Lenders or special deposits held by the Lenders; (ii) in respect of contingent and unmatured indebtedness; or (iii) in favor of participants.
     This opinion is delivered to you in connection with the transaction referenced above and may only be relied upon by you, any Eligible Assignee or Participant under the Credit Agreement, and McGuireWoods LLP without our prior written consent; , this opinion letter may be furnished or quoted to regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over you.

Indemnification
          (b) . The effect, if applicable, of fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, and preferential transfer laws, and principles of equitable subordination;
Fraudulent Transfer
 
          (c) . The enforceability in any court of any agreement of the Borrower in a Subject Document to submit to the jurisdiction of a specified federal or state court (other than the enforceability in a court of the State of New York of any such agreement to submit to the jurisdiction of a court of the State of New York); or the enforceability of any agreement of the Borrower in a Subject Document to waive any objection to the laying of the venue, to waive the defense of forum non conveniens in any action or proceeding referred to therein, to waive trial by jury, or to effect service of process in any particular manner or to establish evidentiary standards; or the enforceability of any agreement of the Borrower regarding the choice of law governing a Subject Document (other than the enforceability in a court of the State of New York of any such agreement that the laws of the State of New York shall govern a Subject Document);
Jurisdiction, Venue, etc
          (d) . The creation of any trust relationship by the Borrower on behalf of any Lender Party;
Trust Relationship
          (e) . Federal securities laws or regulations, state securities and Blue Sky laws or regulations, federal and state banking laws and regulations, pension and employee benefit laws and regulations, federal and state environmental laws and regulations, federal and state tax laws and regulations, federal and state health and occupational safety laws and regulations, building code, zoning, subdivision and other laws and regulations governing the development, use and occupancy of real property, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and other federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws and regulations, the Assignment of Claims Act of 1940, and the effect of any of the foregoing on any of the opinions expressed;

Certain Agreements of Borrower Parties
          (i) specific performance of the Borrower's obligations;
          (ii) the right of any purchaser of a participation interest from any Lender to set off or apply any deposit, property or indebtedness with respect to any such participation interest;
          (iii) establishment of a contractual rate of interest payable after judgment;
          (iv) adjustments of payments among Lenders or rights of set off;
          (v) the granting of any power of attorney;

          (vii) obligations to make an agreement in the future; and
          (h) . Any provision in any Subject Document to the effect that rights or remedies are not exclusive, that every right or remedy is cumulative and may be exercised in addition to any other right or remedy, that the election of some particular remedy does not preclude recourse to one or more others or that failure to exercise or delay in exercising rights or remedies will not operate as a waiver of any such right or remedy.
Remedies
          The opinions set forth above are subject to the following qualifications and limitations:
          (a) . Our opinions are limited to the federal law of the United States and the laws of the State of New York, and we do not express any opinion concerning any other law.
Applicable Law
          (b) . Our opinions are subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, laws relating to preferences and fraudulent transfers or conveyances), reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally.
Bankruptcy
          (c) . Our opinions are subject to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing. In applying such principles, a court, among other things, might limit the availability of specific equitable remedies (such as injunctive relief and the remedy of specific performance), might not allow a creditor to accelerate maturity of debt or exercise other remedies upon the occurrence of a default deemed immaterial or for non-credit reasons or might decline to order a debtor to perform covenants in a Subject Document. Further, a court may refuse to enforce a covenant if and to the extent that it deems such covenant to be violative of applicable public policy, including, for example, provisions requiring indemnification of a Lender Party against liability for its own wrongful or negligent acts.
Equitable Principles
          (d) . To the extent that any opinion relates to the enforceability of the choice of New York law and choice of New York forum provisions of any Subject Document, our opinion is rendered in reliance upon N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law  5-1401 and 5-1402 (McKinney 2001) and N.Y. CPLR 327(b) (McKinney 2001) and is subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by public policy considerations of any jurisdiction, other than the courts of the State of New York, in which enforcement of such provisions, or of a judgment upon an agreement containing such provisions, is sought.
Choice of New York Law and Forum
 
          (e) . Provisions in the Subject Documents which provide that any obligations of the Borrower thereunder will not be affected by the action or failure to act on the part of any Lender Party or by an amendment or waiver of the provisions contained in the other Subject Documents might not be enforceable under circumstances in which such action, failure to act, amendment or waiver so materially changes the essential terms of the obligations that, in effect, a new contract has arisen between the Lender Parties and the Borrower.
Material Changes to Terms
          (f) . This opinion does not relate to (and we have not reviewed) any documents or instruments other than the Subject Documents, and we express no opinion as to such other documents or instruments (including, without limitation, any documents or instruments referenced or incorporated in any of the Subject Documents) or as to the interplay between the Subject Documents and any such other documents and instruments.
Incorporated Documents
          The foregoing opinions are being furnished to the Lender Parties for the purpose referred to in the first paragraph of this opinion letter, and this opinion letter is not to be furnished to any other person or entity or used or relied upon for any other purpose without our prior written consent. The opinions set forth herein are made as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to supplement this opinion letter if any applicable laws change after the date hereof or if we become aware after the date hereof of any facts that might change the opinions expressed herein. Headings in this opinion letter are intended for convenience of reference only and shall not affect its interpretation.
