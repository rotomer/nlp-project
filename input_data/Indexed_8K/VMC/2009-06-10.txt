Item 7.01.     Regulation FD Disclosure.
On June 10, 2009, the Company issued a press release in which it announced its intention to offer 11.5 million shares of its common stock to the public and to reduce its future quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2009.  A press release detailing the particulars of the offering is attached as an exhibit to this Form 8-K.  
Additionally, in a presentation to investors, management of Vulcan made the following comments:
Regarding our outlook for 2010, we anticipate year-over-year growth in aggregates volumes, including the stimulus, of approximately 15 percent.  During 2010, when volumes begin to recover, we expect aggregates pricing to improve 6 to 7 percent.  
We believe that the combination of continued federal stimulus spending in 2010, 2011 and 2012, along with renewal of the multi-year federal highway bill, some recovery for housing in 2011, and some late-cycle recovery in non-residential construction, should translate into recovery and growth in aggregates volumes through 2013.  
New highway spending as a result of federal stimulus legislation is expected to contribute to earnings growth at Vulcan from the second half of 2009 through 2012.  During this period, the Company anticipates aggregates shipments from the stimulus plan of 35 to 45 million tons, asphalt shipments of 3 to 4 million tons, and concrete shipments of 250 to 300 thousand cubic yards.  Some 45 to 65 percent of these shipments are expected to occur by the end of 2010.

Exhibit 99.1
Vulcan Materials to Enhance Financial Flexibility
Company to Offer 11.5 Million Shares of Common Stock in Public Equity Offering
Plans to Reduce Future Quarterly Dividend to $0.25
Actions Will Reduce Debt, Strengthen Credit Profile and Provide New Opportunities for the Long Term
BIRMINGHAM, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 10, 2009--Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), the nations largest producer of construction aggregates, today announced that it intends to offer 11.5 million shares of common stock in an underwritten public equity offering. At yesterdays closing price, this offering would yield gross proceeds of approximately $500 million. In addition, the Company plans to reduce its quarterly dividend, effective for the third quarter 2009, to $0.25 from $0.49 per share, which will increase cash available to the Company by approximately $100 million annually.
The Company will offer, subject to market conditions, up to 11.5 million shares of common stock in an underwritten registered public offering. In connection with this offering, the Company intends to grant the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 15 percent of the number of shares sold in the offering. The Company will use the capital raised through the equity offering for debt reduction and other corporate purposes, enhancing flexibility for strategic investments in organic and bolt-on growth opportunities. After giving effect to the offering, the Companys total debt to total capital ratio would equal 44 percent, down from 50 percent as of March 31, 2009. Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch & Co., J.P.Morgan and Wachovia Securities will act as the joint book-running managers of the offering.
Todays actions will position Vulcan to participate more effectively in the nations economic recovery, while addressing the effects of the current prolonged recession, said the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Don James. While our current liquidity is adequate to address our needs, the actions announced today will create further opportunities for Vulcan and will realign our capital structure for the long term.
Vulcan has a long history of returning cash to shareholders, having paid a dividend every year since becoming a public company in 1956. Reducing our dividend in this adverse economic environment allows Vulcan to maintain a strong balance sheet while providing our shareholders with a competitive dividend yield.
Outlook
In conjunction with todays announced actions, the Company updated its outlook for 2009. Aggregates shipments in the second quarter are expected to be 27 to 32 percent lower than the prior years second quarter due to weak demand and unusually wet weather in key markets. Second quarter aggregates prices are anticipated to increase 4 to 5 percent from the prior year. Shipments in the second half of 2009 are expected to decline from the second half of 2008, but second half comparisons should improve over first half comparisons as the result of more normal weather patterns and the initial impacts of federal stimulus funds. The Company now expects 2009 full year aggregate shipments, including some projected incremental demand in the second half of 2009 from the stimulus plan, to decline 17 to 20 percent from 2008 levels. Full year aggregates prices should increase 4 to 5 percent from the 2008 levels, reflecting stable price growth.
As a result, the Company estimates that second quarter earnings from continuing operations will be in the range of $0.15 to $0.30 per diluted share. For the second half of 2009, the Company estimates earnings of $0.85 to $1.00 per share, compared to 2008 second half earnings of $0.65 per share. Full year earnings from continuing operations are expected to be in the range of $0.70 to $1.00 per diluted share. These estimates do not include the impact of the proposed equity issuance.
For the full year 2009, capital spending is expected to be approximately $175 million, down sharply from the $353 million spent in 2008. Debt reduction and achieving the Companys target debt ratio of 35 to 40 percent remain a priority use of cash flows, including the funds generated by the actions announced today. The Company now expects to reduce total debt by approximately $700 million during 2009.
Commenting on the Companys outlook for 2009, Mr. James stated, While we are clearly continuing to feel the effects of the recession, the Company has been focused on managing costs and driving profitability in the current environment, and believes that it is well positioned to benefit as the construction cycle turns. We believe that the combination of continued federal stimulus spending in 2010, 2011 and 2012, along with renewal of the multi-year federal highway bill, some recovery for housing in 2011, and some late-cycle recovery in non-residential construction, will translate into substantial growth in aggregates shipments through 2013. In summary, the actions announced today will enhance our ability to participate fully in activity generated by increased infrastructure spending by federal, state and local governments and in the overall economic recovery.
