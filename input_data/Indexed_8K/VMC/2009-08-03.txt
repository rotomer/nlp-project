BIRMINGHAM, Ala.,Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC), the nations largest producer of construction aggregates, announced results today for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009.
Aug. 3 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ --
Second Quarter Summary and Comparisons with the Prior Year
 
Commenting for the Company, Don James, Vulcans Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, While our current results reflect the volume effect of the prolonged recession, we are encouraged by the increased level of bid activity by state transportation departments as well as the significant increase in highway construction contract awards reported in May and June. The increased level of bid activity and contracts awarded demonstrate that funding provided by the federal economic stimulus plan, or American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), is working its way into the economy.  We expect construction activity referable to these contract awards to begin in the second half of 2009 and to provide a meaningful contribution to overall aggregates demand in 2010.
We remain focused on managing costs and generating cash, which will enhance our ability to increase earnings as the economy recovers and construction activity improves.  In early June, we further strengthened our balance sheet and enhanced our financial flexibility by completing a successful public equity offering.  Net proceeds of $520 million from the offering were used to reduce short-term bank borrowings, thereby freeing up a like amount of liquidity under our lines of credit.
Second Quarter Operating Results Commentary
Second quarter earnings for aggregates declined as the impact of sharply lower shipments more than offset the earnings benefit from improved prices, lower unit costs for diesel fuel and cost control measures.  Aggregates shipments declined 31 percent from the prior year due to weak demand and wet weather.  The decrease in aggregates volumes reduced second quarter EBITDA by approximately $112 million versus the prior year.  The increase in the average selling price for aggregates reflects wide variations across Vulcan-served markets.  Many major markets realized price improvement from the prior year well above the 3 percent average, while certain markets in the far West and Florida reported year-over-year declines in average selling price.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
By rationalizing production, reducing operating hours, streamlining the workforce and effectively managing spending, the Company offset some of the cost impact related to lower volumes.   Aggregates cash fixed costs were reduced 17 percent from the prior years second quarter.  The unit cost for diesel fuel decreased 54 percent from the prior years second quarter, increasing earnings $0.12 per diluted share.
Asphalt earnings in the second quarter were higher than last years second quarter as material margins recovered to more normal levels, reflecting moderation in the cost of liquid asphalt, which more than offset the earnings effect of a 30 percent decline in asphalt volumes.  Concrete earnings decreased from the prior years second quarter due primarily to lower volumes.
Cement earnings showed a slight loss in the second quarter due to the effects of weaker sales volumes, slightly offset by lower energy costs.
Selling, administrative and general expenses in the second quarter decreased $5 million from the prior year. Cost-saving actions implemented across the Company to align spending levels with weak product demand more than offset $4 million in project costs related to the replacement of legacy IT systems.  Additionally, the prior years second quarter included expenses of $6 million for the fair market value of donated real estate.
During the second quarter, we revised our estimated annual effective tax rate to 6.4 percent, significantly lower than the 23.2 percent estimated in the first quarter.  An adjustment to the current quarters income tax provision was required so that the year-to-date provision reflects the expected annual tax rate.  A substantial amount of the tax benefit recognized for the loss reported in the first quarter of 2009 was reversed during the second quarter to reflect the revised annual rate.  This adjustment reduced earnings $0.06 per diluted share, during the second quarter of 2009, resulting in an effective tax rate of 38.2 percent, as compared with 31.0 percent in the second quarter of 2008.
All results are unaudited.
Outlook Highlights and Commentary
Commenting on the Companys outlook for 2009, Mr. James stated, The current year remains challenging due to weak private construction activity.  Despite these challenges, we believe the cost management actions we have taken, along with our disciplined approach to pricing, and the improved liquidity and financial flexibility we have achieved, will enable us to participate fully in the economic recovery.
Plant operating costs and overhead are being tightly managed as we continue to adjust our cost structure to match the weak demand environment.  Additionally, lower unit costs for diesel fuel and liquid asphalt should continue to benefit earnings in 2009.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
We expect higher selling prices for our products in 2009 to partially offset the earnings effects of lower volumes.  For the full year 2009, we expect aggregates pricing to improve 3 to 4 percent.  The average selling price for asphalt mix in 2009 should also increase from 2008.
Our revised outlook for 2009 aggregates demand is due primarily to further weakness expected in private construction.  U.S. contract awards in the most recent two months for private nonresidential and private infrastructure construction have weakened, lowering our expectation for aggregates demand from this end use in the second half of the year.  Specifically, published contract awards for private nonresidential buildings reported during the second quarter declined more than 60 percent in Vulcan-served states when compared with the prior years second quarter.  Contract awards for private infrastructure-related projects declined more than 80 percent.  As a result, we now expect 2009 full year aggregates shipments to decline 21 to 24 percent from 2008 levels.
 
We expect the further weakness in private construction awards to be offset somewhat by incremental demand in the second half of 2009 from highway construction activity related primarily to economic stimulus projects.  State departments of transportation and local governments continue to make good progress obligating stimulus dollars for transportation projects.  In July, the Federal Highway Administration reported that 64 percent of the $26.8 billion of ARRA highway funds has been obligated by state departments of transportation, up from $13 billion at the end of May.  Additionally, the number of transportation projects bid and the frequency of bid lettings have increased in recent months, contributing to a 61 percent increase in the value of transportation contract awards in June in Vulcan-served states.  Overall, our outlook for stimulus-related demand remains unchanged for the second half of 2009 and beyond.
As a result, we now expect second half earnings of $0.60 to $0.85 per diluted share, including $0.55 to $0.80 per diluted share from continuing operations.  In the second half of 2008, earnings were $0.63 per share, excluding the noncash charge for impairment of the goodwill associated with the cement segment.  Full year earnings are expected to be $0.51 to $0.76 per diluted share, including $0.40 to $0.65 per diluted share from continuing operations.
Debt reduction and achieving target debt ratios remain a priority use of cash flows. With the proceeds of the recent equity offering and the previously announced reduction in the quarterly dividend, we expect to reduce total debt by approximately $700 million during 2009.  For the full year 2009, we expect capital spending to be approximately $175 million, down sharply from the $354 million spent in 2008.
Looking ahead to 2010, Vulcan should benefit from our aggregates-focused strategy that is complemented by our asphalt and concrete operations in certain markets.  Our preliminary estimates for growth in demand for our products from stimulus-related construction activity, as well as some improvement in residential construction, point toward growth in earnings.  Our available production capacity and improved cost structure position Vulcan to participate efficiently and effectively in the supply of material for economic stimulus projects.  Key Vulcan-served states such as California, Florida and Texas will receive the largest percentage of highway funding under the stimulus plan and are likely targets for above-average funding for other stimulus spending for infrastructure because of their high growth and large population base.

EBITDA is an acronym for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.  Cash earnings adjusts EBITDA for net interest and current taxes.  These financial metrics are often used by the investment community as indicators of a companys ability to incur and service debt.  They are not defined by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP); thus, it should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities, operating earnings, or any other liquidity or performance measure defined by GAAP.
 
These metrics are presented for the convenience of investment professionals that use such metrics in their analysis and to provide the Company's shareholders an understanding of metrics management uses to assess performance and to monitor our cash and liquidity positions.  Due to the significant write-up of the assets acquired in the November 2007 acquisition of Florida Rock resulting from the application of SFAS 141, Business Combinations, Vulcan's management internally uses EBITDA, cash earnings and other such measures to assess the operating performance of the acquired Florida Rock assets and consolidated company.  Vulcan's management does not use these metrics as a measure to allocate resources internally.
