Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
Effective as of October 1, 2009, Vulcan Materials Company ("Vulcan" "we" or "us") terminated its revolving $175 million 364-Day Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, National Association, as administrative agent and the other Lenders party thereto (the "Lenders") dated November 17, 2008.
The material terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement are set forth on our Current Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 17, 2008.
The Credit Agreement was scheduled to terminate by its terms on November 16, 2009. We chose to terminate the Credit Agreement prior to that date because we no longer needed the borrowing capacity. We terminated the Credit Agreement early in order to save the facility fees which would otherwise have been due for the remainder of the term.
We did not incur any penalties by canceling the Credit Agreement prior to its scheduled termination date.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
