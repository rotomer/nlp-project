The directors present at any such special meeting shall make reasonable effort to notify all absent directors of any action taken thereat, but failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the action taken at any such meeting.

                (b)  The Board of Directors shall have the power to alter, amend, or repeal any Articles of these By-laws by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the directors present at any special meeting attended by two or more directors and held in the manner prescribed in paragraph (a) of this Article, if it is determined in good faith by said two-thirds that such alteration, amendment or repeal would be conducive to the proper direction of the corporations affairs.
