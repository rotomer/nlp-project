Additional information about the method of calculation of the 2010 bonus follows.
 
 
Bonus Earned in 2010 Payable in Current Year
Each of the NEOs participates in the Companys Executive Incentive Plan (EIP). Under this plan, participating executives are entitled to earn an annual cash incentive award to the extent established financial objectives are achieved.
The payment of the bonus is subject to both the attainment of a minimum performance threshold for the year, as established by the Compensation Committee and the Committees downward discretion based on the Economic Profit (EP) performance of the Company. For 2010, the minimum threshold for earning a cash bonus was either:
Even though the minimum financial performance threshold under EIP was achieved in 2010, the Companys results at the corporate level, under the EP formula, fell well short of the performance goal. Upon recommendation by the CEO, the Compensation Committee determined to exercise its discretion not to pay cash bonuses for the NEOs for 2010.
Long-Term Incentive Award Payments
 
The Compensation Committee also authorized payments to the NEOs for the Performance Share Units (PSUs) previously granted in 2008 pursuant to the Companys 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The payments were based on internal performance measures, total shareholder return versus the S&P 500 index, and changes in the market value of our common stock.
 
The following table sets forth the amount earned for the previously granted PSUs for the three year period ending December 31, 2010. The earned value will be paid in shares of the Companys common stock.
