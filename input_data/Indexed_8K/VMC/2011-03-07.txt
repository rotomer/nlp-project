On March 3, 2011, we received an imminent danger order issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 at our Uvalde Quarry in Uvalde, Texas. The order was issued when a miner was observed sitting on an access platform adjacent to a screen structure, cleaning material off the platform, without adequate fall protection.  His right leg was hanging over the edge and his body was below the provided hand-railing, exposing himself to a 20 foot fall to the ground.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant had duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
