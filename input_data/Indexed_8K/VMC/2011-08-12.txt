This Form 8-K/A is being filed as an amendment to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Vulcan Materials Company (the Company) with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 13, 2011 (the Original Report).  The sole purpose of this amendment is to disclose the Companys decision regarding how frequently it will conduct shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation.  No other changes have been made to the Original Report.
Item 5.0.7.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holder.
At the Companys 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on May 13, 2011, the Companys Shareholders voted on, among other matters, a proposal regarding the frequency of holding advisory votes on executive compensation.  As previously reported in the Original Report, the shareholders approved, on an advisory basis, an annual advisory vote on compensation for the Companys named executive officers.
In light of these results, the Companys Board of Directors determined that the Company will hold an advisory vote on executive compensation every year until the next shareholder advisory vote on this matter.
