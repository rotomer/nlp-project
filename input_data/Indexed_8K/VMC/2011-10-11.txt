Exhibit 10.1
AGREEMENT by and between Vulcan Materials Company, a New Jersey corporation (the Company) and John R. McPherson (the Executive), dated as of the 7th day of October, 2011.
 
The Board of Directors of the Company (the Board) has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of the Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below) of the Company, and to ensure that in the event of the Executives termination of employment under circumstances entitling the Executive to the payments and benefits under Section 6(a) of this Agreement, the Executive is prohibited from competing with the Company.  The Board believes it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change of Control and to encourage the Executives full attention and dedication to the Company currently and in the event of any threatened or pending Change of Control, and to provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change of Control which ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of the Executive will be satisfied and which are competitive with those of other corporations.  Therefore, in order to accomplish these objectives, the Board has caused the Company to enter into this Agreement.

Death or Disability
 
(b)          .  The Company may terminate the Executives employment during the Employment Period for Cause.  For purposes of this Agreement, Cause shall mean:
Cause
 
(i)           the willful and continued failure of the Executive to perform substantially the Executives duties with the Company or one of its affiliates (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Executive by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or Chief Executive Officer believes that the Executive has not substantially performed the Executives duties, or
 
(ii)          the willful engaging by the Executive in illegal conduct which is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company.
 
For purposes of this provision, no act or failure to act, on the part of the Executive, shall be considered willful unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Executives action or omission was in the best interests of the Company.  Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or a senior officer of the Company or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company.  The cessation of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Executive and the Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive is guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

(iii)         A material change in the geographic location at which the Executive must perform services, provided that a change in office or location permitted under Section 4(a)(i)(B) shall not be considered material for this purpose;
 
(iv)         A material diminution in the budget over which the Executive retains authority; or
 
(v)          Any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company of this Agreement.
 
(d)          .  Any termination by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto given in accordance with Section 12(b) of this Agreement.  For purposes of this Agreement, a Notice of Termination means a written notice which (i) indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) to the extent applicable, sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executives employment under the provision so indicated (including, in the case of a termination for Good Reason, the condition constituting Good Reason) and (iii) if the date on which the termination will become effective is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the termination date (which date shall be not more than thirty days after the giving of such notice, except in the case of a termination for Good Reason, notice shall be not more than 90 days before the termination date).  The Executives employment shall be terminated for Good Reason only if the Executive provides a Notice of Termination to the Company within 90 days of the initial existence of the condition constituting Good Reason and the Company fails to remedy the condition within 30 days of receipt of the Notice of Termination.  Except as provided in the preceding sentence with respect to termination for Good Reason, the failure by the Executive or the Company to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes to a showing of Good Reason or Cause shall not waive any right of the Executive or the Company, respectively, hereunder or preclude the Executive or the Company, respectively, from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing the Executives or the Companys rights hereunder.
Notice of Termination
 
(e)          .  Date of Termination means the date on which the Executive incurs a separation from service with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code).

(iv)        upon the Date of Termination, the Executive shall have the right and option to purchase the automobile which the Company was providing to the Executive immediately prior to the Date of Termination in accordance with the Companys practice for retiring employees as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date (provided that, to the extent such option results in a benefit that is includable in the Executives gross income for federal income tax purposes, such purchase must occur no later than the 15th day of the third month following the end of the Executives taxable year in which the Date of Termination occurs); and
 
(v)         the Company shall, at its sole expense as incurred, provide the Executive with outplacement services the scope and provider of which shall be selected by the Executive in his sole discretion, provided that the aggregate cost of such services shall not exceed $50,000, and provided that (A) such expense shall not be incurred later than the last day of the second taxable year of the Executive following the Date of Termination, (B) any reimbursement for such expenses shall not be paid to the Executive later than the last day of the third taxable year of the Executive following the Date of Termination, and (C) the amount of such expenses shall not exceed the amount of reasonable outplacement expenses, as determined under Treas.

Limitation on Payments Under Certain Circumstances
 
(a)          Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event the Accounting Firm (as defined below) shall determine that receipt of all Payments (as defined below) would subject the Executive to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the Accounting Firm shall determine whether to reduce any of the Payments paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement (the Agreement Payments) so that the Parachute Value (as defined below) of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount (as defined below).  The Agreement Payments shall be so reduced only if the Accounting Firm determines that the Executive would have a greater Net After-Tax Receipt (as defined below) of aggregate Payments if the Agreement Payments were so reduced.  If the Accounting Firm determines that the Executive would not have a greater Net After-Tax Receipt (as defined below) of aggregate Payments if the Agreement Payments were so reduced, the Executive shall receive all Agreement Payments to which the Executive is entitled hereunder.
 
(b)          If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Agreement Payments should be reduced so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, the Company shall promptly give the Executive notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof.  All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 9 shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive and shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable and in no event later than 15 days following the Date of Termination.  For purposes of reducing the Agreement Payments so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, only amounts payable under this Agreement (and no other Payments) shall be reduced.  The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by reducing the payments and benefits under the following sections in the following order:  (i) cash payments that do not constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, (ii) welfare or in-kind benefits and (iii) cash payments that do constitute deferred compensation, in each case, beginning with payments or benefits that are to be paid the farthest in time from the Accounting Firms determination.   All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.
 
Page 12 of 17
 
(c)          As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement which should not have been so paid or distributed (Overpayment) or that additional amounts which will have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement could have been so paid or distributed (Underpayment), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Safe Harbor Amount hereunder.  In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against either the Company or the Executive which the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success, determines that an Overpayment has been made, the Executive shall pay promptly (and in no event later than 60 days following the date on which the Overpayment is determined) any such Overpayment to the Company together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided, however, that no amount shall be payable by the Executive to the Company if and to the extent such payment would not either reduce the amount on which the Executive is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes.  In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be paid promptly (and in no event later than 60 days following the date on which the Underpayment is determined) by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code.
 
(d)          To the extent requested by the Executive, the Company shall cooperate with the Executive in good faith in valuing, and the Accounting Firm shall take into account the value of, services provided or to be provided by the Executive (including without limitation, the Executives agreeing to refrain from performing services pursuant to a covenant not to compete or similar covenant, including that set forth in Section 10 of this Agreement before, on or after the date of a change in ownership or control of the Company (within the meaning of Q&A-2(b) of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code), such that payments in respect of such services may be considered reasonable compensation within the meaning of Q&A-9 and Q&A-40 to Q&A-44 of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code and/or exempt from the definition of the term parachute payment within the meaning of Q&A-2(a) of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code in accordance with Q&A-5(a) of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code.

Exhibit 10.2
 
WHEREAS, Vulcan Materials Company, its successors, assigns, affiliates, and subsidiaries (Vulcan), has agreed, under certain conditions described herein, to engage the services of McPherson in a consulting capacity in connection with Vulcan business, and McPherson desires to act in a consulting capacity to Vulcan upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth;
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree to enter into an Independent Contractor Consulting Agreement (Consulting Agreement) as set forth below:
(a)           As referenced above, the obligations of this Consulting Agreement only become effective in the event of an occurrence of McPhersons termination of employment for any reason (including Good Reason) other than for Cause Prior to October 18, 2015.   The definitions of the terms Good Reason and Cause contained in McPhersons Change in Control and Non-Competition Agreement dated October 7, 2011 (Change in Control Agreement) are applicable to the terms of this Consulting Agreement.
(b)           Assuming the provisions in paragraph 1(a) are met, Vulcan agrees to retain McPhersons services and McPherson hereby agrees to make himself available to Vulcan to provide consulting services for 400 hours annually over a three year period beginning with the first business day of the calendar month immediately following the termination of employment described in paragraph 1(a) above (the Term of this Consulting Agreement). As compensation for his services, McPherson shall receive, during the Term of this Consulting Agreement, a monthly consulting fee equal to the sum of $43,333 per month. The first payment will be paid to McPherson on the first business day of the calendar month in which the Term begins.  Thereafter, the monthly consulting fee may be paid to McPherson in accordance with the customary payroll practices for service providers of Vulcan, but no less frequently than monthly.
(c)           Vulcan shall reimburse McPherson for all reasonable expenses incurred by him during the Term in connection with the performance of his duties hereunder, provided such expenses are in accordance with the policies of Vulcan in effect at the time of the expenditure and are within such reasonable budgeted limits, if any, as may be established from time to time by the executive officers of Vulcan.  Upon receipt of the expense request (but in no event later than the close of McPhersons taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense was incurred), Vulcan shall promptly reimburse McPherson for such expenses.
 
Page 1 of 4
 
 
(d)           McPherson hereby acknowledges and agrees that during the Term of this Consulting Agreement he shall not be eligible to accrue benefits in any employee benefit retirement plans maintained by Vulcan (or any of its affiliates), or to receive any fringe benefits or participate in any welfare benefit plan other than that for which he is eligible pursuant to the terms of his Change in Control Agreement and in accordance with applicable law.
(a)           During the Term, McPherson shall serve as a consultant to Vulcan with respect to such business matters and at such times and places as the officials of Vulcan may reasonably request.  McPherson shall act in the capacity of an independent contractor and shall not be subject to the direction, control or supervision of Vulcan with respect to consulting services or procedures followed in the performance of his consulting services hereunder.  McPherson represents and warrants that he shall assume all obligations and duties of an independent contractor and that he shall hold Vulcan harmless from all liabilities, actions, suits, audits, assessments, or other claims made or brought by any person, corporation, tax authority, governmental agency or entity.  McPherson will not be considered an agent, employee, executive officer or servant of Vulcan during the Term of this Consulting Agreement and McPherson will have no authority to bind Vulcan in any capacity for any purpose.
(b)           McPherson shall assist with various strategic planning and business development opportunities for Vulcan, pursuant to the direction of Vulcans Chief Executive Officer or as otherwise determined by Vulcans Board of Directors.
 
(c)           The specific hours during which McPherson performs such services on any given day will be within McPherson's control.
(a)           McPherson agrees that he will not use Confidential Information in any way that might injure or damage Vulcan or disclose such Confidential Information to anyone without Vulcans prior written consent, and agrees to return promptly at the close of this Consulting Agreement any written Confidential Information including all copies (in electronic, hard copy or other form) that he may have in his possession. Unless at Vulcans request, pursuant to his duties under this Consulting Agreement, or as otherwise provided by law, he also agrees to refrain from discussing any of Vulcans business matters with anyone, including, but not limited to, Vulcans employees, customers, vendors, or competitors.
(b)           As used above, Confidential Information means information which meets all of the following criteria:  (1) disclosed to or known by McPherson as a consequence of or through work performed by him during his prior employment with Vulcan or pursuant to the terms of this Consulting Agreement; (2) not generally known outside Vulcan; and (3) which relates to Vulcans business or internal procedures.  Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, trade secrets as defined in the Alabama Trade Secrets Act, Alabama Code  8-27-1 et. seq., as amended.
(c)           Vulcan shall be deemed to be the absolute and unqualified owner of all work produced by McPherson under this Consulting Agreement, and all data and research materials for which Vulcan has reimbursed McPherson, it being understood that McPherson acts as an independent contractor and has no right, title, or interest in or to such material.
 
Page 2 of 4
 
(d)           In the event any covenant contained in this Section 3 shall be to any extent construed by any court of competent jurisdiction as being too broad in area or time, or both, or otherwise to any extent held invalid, then those portions thereof which may be construed to be invalid or unenforceable shall be severed and the remaining portions thereof shall continue in full force and effect.  The covenants set forth in this Section 3 are and shall be construed as independent covenants and shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of McPherson's services hereunder.
(e)           During the Term of this Consulting Agreement, McPherson acknowledges he may be exposed to airline or flying related activities, industrial activities, or mining activities and areas of mining, both dormant and active, and to areas which are otherwise acknowledged to pose a risk of injury to person and property.  Thus, as part of this Consulting Agreement, McPherson, on behalf of himself, his spouse, legal representatives, personal representatives, estate, heirs, assigns, and beneficiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as the Consultant for purposes of this Section), hereby waives and discharges Vulcan, its successors, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, officers and directors (hereinafter collectively referred to as Vulcan for purposes of this Section) from all liability for any and all loss or damage, any claim or damages resulting therefrom, on account of injury to Consultants person or property, even injuries resulting in the death of Consultant, while Consultant is on or about the property of Vulcan or performing work for Vulcan.
(f)           In addition, it is specifically agreed that damages would be inadequate to compensate Vulcan for any breach or threatened breach by McPherson of any such covenants and that the breach by McPherson of any of such covenants will result in irreparable harm and injury to Vulcan.  Therefore, McPherson agrees and consents that Vulcan shall, in addition to and without limiting any other remedy or right it may have, be entitled to such equitable and injunctive relief as may be available to restrain or prevent a breach or contemplated breach of any such covenant, such right to be cumulative and in addition to any other remedy Vulcan may have, including the recovery of damages by Vulcan.
This Consulting Agreement may be terminated prior to its termination date under the following circumstances, at any time, by Vulcan in the event any of the following occurs:
(a)           McPherson is arrested for, charged with, convicted of or pleads guilty to a crime constituting a felony or involving moral turpitude; or
(b)           McPherson engages in misconduct satisfying the definition of Cause as set forth in his Employment Agreement; or
(c)           The death of McPherson, or his experiencing a disability such that he is unable to perform his duties hereunder, with or without reasonable accommodation.
 
Page 3 of 4
 
(a)           This Consulting Agreement shall be binding upon Vulcan, its successors and assigns and shall be binding upon McPherson in accord with its terms.  This Consulting Agreement may be assigned by Vulcan to any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, without consent of McPherson.  This Consulting Agreement shall not be assignable by McPherson.
(b)           McPherson shall have full responsibility for satisfying any liability for any federal, state or local income or other taxes required by law to be paid with respect to the fees paid to him pursuant to this Consulting Agreement.
(c)           The interpretation and enforcement of this Consulting Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey without application of its conflicts of laws provisions.
(d)           This Consulting Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties with reference to the subject matter hereof and shall not be changed or modified except by a written instrument executed by both parties.  The waiver by either party of a breach of any provisions of this Consulting Agreement by the other party shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent or other breach by such other party.
(e)           To the extent applicable, this Consulting Agreement is intended to comply with, or be exempt from, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code).   This Consulting Agreement will be administered, construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent.  In the event that McPherson determines, in good faith, that a provision of this Consulting Agreement or that the terms of his consulting relationship with Vulcan could reasonably violate Section 409A of the Code or result in taxes accrued pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, McPherson has the right to request a modification or amendment to this Consulting Agreement or to the terms of his consulting relationship with Vulcan that will cure such a violation.  In the event that Vulcan denies McPhersons request for modification or amendment of this Consulting Agreement or to the consulting relationship, McPherson has the right to unilaterally terminate this Consulting Agreement.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement as of October 7, 2011.
