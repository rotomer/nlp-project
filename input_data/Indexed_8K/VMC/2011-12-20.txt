Item 1.01   Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On December 15, 2011, Vulcan Materials Company (Vulcan, we, our, or us) entered into a credit agreement (the ABL Credit Agreement) providing for a $600 million asset based lending credit facility (the ABL Credit Facility) with SunTrust Bank, as administrative agent (in such capacity, the Administrative Agent), and the lenders (the Lenders) and other parties thereto. The Lenders are:
The ABL Credit Facility is senior secured debt of Vulcan, and is secured by accounts receivable and inventory (the Collateral), and borrowings are limited by a borrowing base derived from advance rates against the Collateral.  Additionally, the ABL Credit Facility is guaranteed by most of our subsidiaries.  The ABL Credit Agreement contains representations, affirmative, negative, and financial covenants and events of default customary for credit facilities of this type.  The primary covenants include limitations on liens, indebtedness, guaranties, certain restricted payments, and acquisitions and divestitures, and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio that is only applicable if our facility usage exceeds 90% of the lesser of the facility amount and the borrowing base.  The ABL Credit Facility matures on December 15, 2016.
Proceeds of the ABL Credit Facility will be used for general corporate purposes.
The loans under the ABL Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate (LIBOR), or the Base Rate (which is defined as the highest of the SunTrust prime rate, the Federal funds rate plus 0.50% and the one-month Eurodollar Rate determined on a daily basis plus 1.00%) at the option of Vulcan, plus a margin determined by reference to a facility-utilization based pricing grid.  With less than 34% of the facility used currently, the applicable margin under the ABL Credit Facility is 1.75% over the Eurodollar Rate.
Certain of the Lenders and their affiliates have provided, from time to time, and may continue to provide, investment banking, commercial banking, financial and other services to us, including letters of credit, depository services and account processing services, for which we have paid and intend to pay customary fees, and our pension fund also invests in funds managed by certain of the Lenders or affiliates of the Lenders. Certain of the Lenders were parties to our prior credit agreements.
The foregoing description of the ABL Credit Facility is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the ABL Credit Agreement, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 1.1 to this Report and is incorporated in this Report by reference.

The Majority Lenders may at any time revoke the Administrative Agents authority to direct the Swing Bank to make Overadvances pursuant to this Section 2.1(d)(ii) and instruct the Administrative Agent to demand repayment of outstanding Revolving Loans from the Credit Parties to the extent necessary to cause an Overadvance to cease to exist.  Any such revocation must be in writing and shall become effective prospectively upon the Administrative Agents receipt thereof.  Absent such revocation, the Administrative Agents determination that funding of a Revolving Loan is appropriate shall be conclusive.  In the event the Administrative Agent obtains actual knowledge that an Overadvance exists, regardless of the amount of, or reason for, such Overadvance, the Administrative Agent shall notify Lenders as soon as practicable (and prior to making any (or any additional) intentional Overadvances (except for and excluding amounts charged to the Loan Account for interest, fees, or expenses owed to the Lender Group) unless the Administrative Agent determines that prior notice would result in imminent harm to the Collateral or its value, in which case the Administrative Agent may (subject to the limitations set forth in the first sentence of this paragraph (ii)) make such Overadvances and provide notice as promptly as practicable thereafter), and Lenders with Revolving Loan Commitments thereupon shall, together with the Administrative Agent, jointly determine the terms of arrangements that shall be implemented with the Borrowers intended to reduce, within a reasonable time, the outstanding principal amount of the Overadvance.  In such circumstances, if any Lender with a Revolving Loan Commitment objects to the proposed terms of reduction or repayment of any Overadvance, the terms of reduction or repayment thereof shall be implemented according to the determination of the Majority Lenders.  In any event: (x) if any Overadvance remains outstanding for more than thirty (30) days, unless otherwise agreed to by the Majority Lenders, the Borrowers shall immediately repay the Revolving Loans in an amount sufficient to eliminate all such Overadvances, and (y) after the date all Overadvances have been eliminated, there must be at least five (5) consecutive days before Overadvances are made or permitted to remain outstanding.  Each Lender shall be obligated to settle with the Administrative Agent or Swing Bank Lender as provided in Section 2.1(e) or Section 2.2(g), as applicable, for the amount of such Lenders pro rata share of any unintentional Overadvances by the Administrative Agent reported to such Lender, any intentional Overadvances made as permitted under this Section 2.1(d)(ii), and any Overadvances resulting from the charging to the Loan Account of interest, fees, or expenses.

(iv)         Each Lender and Issuing Bank shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Taxes attributable to such Lender or Issuing Bank (but only to the extent that a Credit Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Taxes and without limiting the obligation of any Credit Party to do so) and (ii) any other taxes attributable to such Lender or Issuing Bank, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender or Issuing Bank by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

Each such Foreign Lender agrees to provide the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers with new forms prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered form, or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent forms delivered by it to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers.  In addition, if a payment made to a Lender, Administrative Agent, or Issuing Bank (and, in each case, any financial institution through which any payment is made subject to such recipient) under any Loan Document would be subject to United States federal withholding imposed by FATCA if such Lender, Administrative Agent, or Issuing Bank were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA, such Lender, Administrative Agent, or Issuing Bank shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers such forms or other documents as shall be prescribed by Applicable Law, if any, or as otherwise reasonably requested, as may be necessary for the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, as applicable, to determine that such payment is exempt from withholding under FATCA.

The Borrowers agree that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.10(b) may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrowers in the amount of such participation.

Upon receipt of any such Request for Issuance of Letter of Credit, subject to satisfaction of all conditions precedent thereto as set forth in Section 4.2 or waiver of such conditions pursuant to the last sentence of Section 4.2, the Issuing Bank shall process such Request for Issuance of Letter of Credit and the certificates, documents and other papers and information delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested thereby.  The Issuing Bank shall furnish a copy of such Letter of Credit to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent following the issuance thereof.  In addition to the fees payable pursuant to Section 2.4(c)(ii), the Borrowers shall pay or reimburse the Issuing Bank for normal and customary costs and expenses incurred by the Issuing Bank in issuing, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering the Letters of Credit.

The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of any draw under a Letter of Credit.  At such time as the Administrative Agent shall be notified by the Issuing Bank that the beneficiary under any Letter of Credit has drawn on the same, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrowers and the Swing Bank (or, at its option, all Lenders), by telephone or telecopy, of the amount of the draw and, in the case of each Lender, such Lenders portion of such draw amount as calculated in accordance with its Revolving Commitment Ratio.

Each Lender shall pay its share of such Base Rate Loan to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.2(e) and its Revolving Commitment Ratio, without reduction for any set-off or counterclaim of any nature whatsoever and regardless of whether any Default or Event of Default exists or would be caused thereby.  The disbursement of funds in connection with a draw under a Letter of Credit pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 2.2(e).  The obligation of each Lender to make payments to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, in accordance with this Section 2.15 shall be absolute and unconditional and no Lender shall be relieved of its obligations to make such payments by reason of noncompliance by any other Person with the terms of the Letter of Credit or for any other reason (other than the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank in paying such Letter of Credit, as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction).  The Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received from the other Lenders.  Any overdue amounts payable by the Lenders to the Issuing Bank in respect of a draw under any Letter of Credit shall bear interest, payable on demand, (x) for the first two (2) Business Days, at the Federal Funds Rate, and (y) thereafter, at the Base Rate.

In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in good faith, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

All costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, incurred by the Administrative Agent in obtaining performance of or collecting payments due under this Guaranty shall be deemed part of the Obligations guaranteed hereby.

 Section 12.2      .  If any Change in Law shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Lender to make, maintain, or fund its Eurodollar Loans, such Lender shall so notify the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Lenders and the Borrowers.  Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 12.2, such Lender shall designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.  Upon receipt of such notice, notwithstanding anything contained in Article 2, the Borrowers shall repay in full the then outstanding principal amount of each affected Eurodollar Loan of such Lender, together with accrued interest thereon, either (a) on the last day of the then current Eurodollar Loan Period applicable to such Eurodollar Loan if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Eurodollar Loan to such day or (b) immediately if such Lender may not lawfully continue to fund and maintain such Eurodollar Loan to such day.

(a)           If any Change in Law:
 
(i)           Shall subject any Lender to any tax, duty, or other charge with respect to its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans or its Eurodollar Loans, or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender of the principal of or interest on its Eurodollar Loans or in respect of any other amounts due under this Agreement in respect of its Eurodollar Loans or its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender);
 
(ii)           Shall impose, modify, or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding any included in an applicable Eurodollar Reserve Percentage), special deposit, assessment, or other requirement or condition against assets of, deposits (other than as described in Section 12.5) with or for the account of, or commitments or credit extended by any Lender, or shall impose on any Lender or the eurodollar interbank borrowing market any other condition affecting its obligation to make such Eurodollar Loans or its Eurodollar Loans; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any such Eurodollar Loans or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by the Lender under this Agreement or under any Revolving Loan Notes with respect thereto, and such increase is not given effect in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate;
 
(iii)           Shall subject the Issuing Bank or any Lender to any tax, duty or other charge with respect to the obligation to issue Letters of Credit, maintain Letters of Credit or participate in Letters of Credit, or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to the Issuing Bank or any Lender in respect of amounts drawn under Letters of Credit or in respect of any other amounts due under this Agreement in respect of Letters of Credit or the obligation of the Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit or maintain Letters of Credit or the obligation of the Lenders to participate in Letters of Credit (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of the Issuing Bank or any Lender); or

then promptly upon demand, which demand shall be accompanied by the certificate described in Section 12.3(b), by such Lender or Issuing Bank, the Borrowers agree to pay, without duplication of amounts due under Section 2.8(b), to such Lender or Issuing Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank for such increased costs.  Each Lender or Issuing Bank will promptly notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Lender or the Issuing Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section 12.3 and will designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the sole judgment of such Lender or the Issuing Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender or the Issuing Bank.

Concurrently with prepaying such Eurodollar Loans, the Borrowers shall borrow a Base Rate Loan, or a Eurodollar Loan not so affected, from such Lender, and such Lender shall make such Loan in an amount such that the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans held by such Lender shall equal the outstanding principal amount of such Revolving Loans immediately prior to such prepayment.
 
(c)           The Issuing Bank and each Lender shall endeavor to notify the Borrowers of any event occurring after the date of this Agreement entitling the Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, to compensation under this Section 12.3 within one hundred eighty (180) days after the Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, obtains actual knowledge thereof; that if the Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, fails to give such notice within one hundred eighty (180) days after it obtains actual knowledge of such an event, the Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, shall, with respect to compensation payable pursuant to this Section 12.3 in respect of any costs resulting from such event, only be entitled to payment under this Section 12.3 for costs incurred from and after the date one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the date that the Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, gives such notice.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Investor Contact:  Mark Warren (205) 298-3220
Media Contact:  David Donaldson (205) 298-3220
 Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) today announced that it is consolidating its eight divisions into four operating regions as part of ongoing efforts to reduce overhead costs and increase operating efficiency.  This initiative is expected to generate an ongoing annualized pre-tax cost savings of approximately $30 million, in addition to approximately $25 million in annual pre-tax overhead reductions already implemented in 2011.  The initiative, which senior management began developing earlier in the year, was approved by Vulcans Board of Directors at its regularly scheduled quarterly meeting on December 9, 2011, following a preliminary review of the Companys proposal at the Boards October 14, 2011 meeting.
Birmingham, Ala. December 19, 2011
The new organizational structure is consistent with Vulcans longstanding commitment to decentralized management of its sales, marketing and operating functions, and will enable the Company to maintain close, local relationships with its customers. It also will allow the Company to leverage significant investments in technology that have replaced legacy IT and financial reporting systems.  These new systems support improvement in administrative and operating efficiencies while also creating new opportunities for greater standardization and implementation of best practices throughout the organization.
The Company expects that approximately 200 positions will be affected, with most coming from overhead and administrative staff.  Staffing at plant facilities will be largely unaffected.
Donald M. James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "This consolidation is another important step in our ongoing efforts to optimize operational efficiency and better position the Company for improved performance.  We are very mindful of the impact this initiative will have on affected employees and will work with them to make this transition as smooth as possible.
Following the consolidation, Vulcan will have four regions: East, South, Central and West.
 
 
 
 
Exhibit 99.2
The Senior Vice Presidents heading the newly formed regions will report to Danny R. Shepherd, Executive Vice President, Construction Materials.
As a result of the consolidation, Vulcan expects to record a charge of approximately $10 million on a pre-tax basis, or $0.05 per share after tax, during the fourth quarter of 2011.  This charge will consist primarily of severance costs.  Vulcan expects to substantially complete the consolidation in the first quarter of 2012.
Vulcan Materials will continue to report financial results for its four operating segments  Aggregates, Concrete, Asphalt Mix and Cement.
The above announcement relates to an action that was approved by the Board prior to the receipt on December 12, 2011 by Vulcan of the unsolicited exchange offer from Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (Martin Marietta) to exchange Vulcan common stock for Martin Marietta common stock, with respect to which Vulcans Board of Directors has not yet made a recommendation to shareholders. Vulcans Board of Directors is continuing to review such offer and, as previously announced, intends to advise shareholders of its recommendation by December 23, 2011 via a Solicitation/Recommendation statement on Schedule 14D-9 that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and made available to Vulcan shareholders.  The Board continues to advise shareholders to take no action at this time pending the completion of its review.
