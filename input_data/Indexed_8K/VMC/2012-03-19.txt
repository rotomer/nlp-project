Item 1.04 Mine Safety
 
On March 16, 2012, Vulcan Materials Company (the Company) received an imminent danger order issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 at our Savannah Quarry in Hardin County, Tennessee. The order was issued when a customer truck driver was observed standing on top of a loaded truck, parked in the tarp rack without wearing the proper fall protection. The area where the truck driver was standing was approximately 8-9 feet from the ground level and the Company had previously posted a notice prohibiting the practice of climbing on truck loads. The truck driver acknowledged that he was aware of the prohibition and that he had received that information through site specific training. The Mine Safety and Health Administration also issued two 104(a) S&S citations to the Company for the customer truck driver failing to wear a safety belt and line (56.15005) and for not providing site specific hazard awareness training (56.46.11(b)) to the customer truck driver. The Company provided the customer truck driver additional site specific hazard awareness training, and the order and additional citations were terminated pursuant to the MSHA regulations.
