Item 1.04 Mine Safety
 
On September 10, 2012, Vulcan Materials Company (the Company) received an imminent danger order issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 at our TSB Cement Plant in Newberry, Florida.  The order and subsequent 104(a) S&S citation were issued when a tanker driver employed by M&M Carrier Group Corp was observed standing on top of the cement tanker without using the provided fall prevention equipment.
 
As of filing time, MSHA officials have verbally communicated to the Company that the 107(a) imminent danger order as well as the 104(a) S&S citation will be vacated and re-issued to M&M Carrier Group Corp.
