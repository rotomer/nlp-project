Item 1.04 Mine Safety
 
On December 17, 2012, Vulcan Materials Company (the Company) received an imminent danger order issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 at its Tuscaloosa Quarry, in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama. The order was issued because a drill rig operator performed work within eight feet of the base of a high wall that was deemed by the MSHA inspector as having large, loose and under-cut overhead material. The area at the base of the high wall was barricaded to prevent re-entry. No injuries occurred from this incident.
