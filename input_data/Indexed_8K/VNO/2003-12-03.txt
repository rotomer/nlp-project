Vornado Realty Trust (the "Company") is electing to re-issue in an updated format the presentation of its historical financial statements in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ("SFAS 144").
 
During 2003, the Company has classified certain properties as assets related to discontinued operations and, in accordance with SFAS 144, has reported revenue and expenses related to these properties as discontinued operations for the periods presented in its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2003. This reclassification had no effect on the Company's reported net income or net income per common share.  This Current Report on Form 8-K updates Part II, Items 6, 7 and 8 of the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 to reflect those properties as discontinued operations for comparison purposes.
 
Additionally, the Company has revised its presentation of EBITDA and Funds From Operations ("FFO") for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 in order to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G concerning non-GAAP financial measures, and to adhere to NAREIT's definition of FFO.  Regulation G was not effective at the time of the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002.
 
In 2003, the Company revised how it presents EBITDA, a measure of performance of its segments, and has revised the disclosure for all periods presented.  EBITDA as disclosed represents "Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization."
 
The information contained in this current report on Form 8-K is presented as of December 31, 2002, and other than as indicated above, has not been updated to reflect developments subsequent to that date.
 
All other items of the Form 10-K remain unchanged.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
Funds from operations ("FFO") does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs which is disclosed in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the applicable periods.  FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company's operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.  Management considers FFO a relevant supplemental measure of operating performance because it provides a basis for comparison among REITs.  FFO is computed in accordance with NAREIT's definition, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with NAREIT's definition.

Index to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
 
Overview
 
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes a discussion of the Company's consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000.
 
Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2002, reflect the Company's January 1, 2002 acquisition of the remaining 66% of Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P. ("CESCR") and the resulting consolidation of CESCR's operations.  See Supplemental Information, page 33, for Condensed Pro Forma Operating Results for the year ended December 31, 2001 giving effect to the CESCR acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2001.
 
The Company has revised its definition of EBITDA to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G concerning non-GAAP financial measures.  The revised definition of EBITDA includes minority interest, gains (losses) on the sale of depreciable real estate and income arising from the straight-lining of rent and the amortization of below market leases net of above market leases.  Accordingly, EBITDA as disclosed represents "Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization."  Management considers EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of its segments as it is related to the return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity.  As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, management utilizes this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of its assets to that of its peers.  EBITDA is not a surrogate for net income because net income is after interest expense and accordingly, is a measure of return on equity as opposed to return on assets.
Critical Accounting Policies
 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.  The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the Company's accounting policies included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K.
 
Real Estate
 
Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.  As of December 31, 2002, the Company's carrying amount of its real estate, net of accumulated depreciation is $6.7 billion.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.  Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components.  If the Company does not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimates the useful lives of its real estate, depreciation expense may be misstated.
 
Upon acquisitions of real estate, the Company assesses the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings, tenant improvements and acquired above and below market leases and the origination cost of acquired in-place leases in accordance with SFAS No. 141) and acquired liabilities, and allocates purchase price based on these assessments.  The Company assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property.  The Company's properties are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.  If the Company incorrectly estimates the values at acquisition or the undiscounted cash flows, initial allocations of purchase price and future impairment charges may be different.  The impact of the Company's estimates in connection with acquisitions and future impairment analysis could be material to the Company's financial statements.
 
Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable
 
The Company evaluates the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of its notes and mortgage loans receivable ($86.6 million as of December 31, 2002) if circumstances warrant to determine whether it is impaired.  If the Company fails to identify that the investee or borrower are unable to perform, the Company's bad debt expense may be different.
 
Partially-Owned Entities
 
The Company accounts for its investments in partially-owned entities ($961.1 million as of December 31, 2002) under the equity method when the Company's ownership interest is more than 20% but less than 50% and the Company does not exercise direct or indirect control.  When partially-owned investments are in partnership form, the 20% threshold may be reduced.  Factors that the Company considers in determining whether or not it exercises control include substantive participating rights of partners on significant business decisions, including dispositions and acquisitions of assets, financing and operating and capital budgets, board and management representation and authority and other contractual rights of its partners.  To the extent that the Company is deemed to control these entities, these entities would have to be consolidated and therefore impact the balance sheet, operations and related ratios.  On a periodic basis the Company evaluates whether there are any indicators that the value of the Company's investments in partially-owned entities are impaired.  An investment is impaired if management's estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying amount.  The ultimate realization of the Company's investment in partially-owned entities is dependent on a number of factors including the performance of the investee and market conditions.  If the Company determines that a decline in the value of its investee is other than temporary, then an impairment charge would be recorded.
 
Allowance For Doubtful Accounts
 
The Company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreement.  The Company also maintains an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents.  This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements.  Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates.  If estimates differ from actual results this would impact reported results.
Revenue Recognition
 
The Company has the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:
Base Rents  income arising from tenant leases.  These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and free rent abatements under the leases.
 - 
                 
Percentage Rents  income arising from retail tenant leases which are contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold.  These rents are recognized in accordance with SAB 101, which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e. sales thresholds have been achieved).
 - 
                 
Hotel Revenues  income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue.  Income is recognized when rooms are occupied.  Food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered.
 - 
                 
Trade Show Revenues  income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths.  This revenue is recognized in accordance with the booth rental contracts when the trade shows have occurred.
 - 
                 
Expense Reimbursement Income  income arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property.  This income is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.
 - 
                 
 
Before the Company recognizes revenue, it assesses among other things, its collectibility.  If the Company incorrectly determines the collectibility of its revenue, its net income and assets could be overstated.
 
Income Taxes
 
The Company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT") under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. The Company intends to distribute to its shareholders 100% of its taxable income.  Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.  If the Company fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders, it would fail to qualify as a REIT and substantial adverse tax consequences may result.
Below is a summary of Net income and EBITDA(1) by segment for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000.  Prior to 2001, income from the Company's preferred stock affiliates ("PSAs") was included in income from partially-owned entities.  On January 1, 2001, the Company acquired the common stock of its PSAs and converted these entities to taxable REIT subsidiaries.  Accordingly, the Hotel portion of the Hotel Pennsylvania and the management companies (which provide services to the Company's business segments and operate the Trade Show business of the Merchandise Mart division) have been consolidated effective January 1, 2001.  Amounts for the year ended December 31, 2000 have been reclassified to give effect to the consolidation of these entities, as if consolidated as of January 1, 2000 (see page 12 for the details of the reclassifications by line item).  In addition, the Company has revised EBITDA as previously reported for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 to include income from the early extinguishment of debt of $1,170,000 in 2001 and expense from the early extinguishment of debt of $1,125,000 in 2000 because such items are no longer treated as extraordinary items in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

Prior to 2001, income from the Company's investments in preferred stock affiliates ("PSAs") was included in income from partially-owned entities.  On January 1, 2001, the Company acquired the common stock of its PSAs and converted these entities to taxable REIT subsidiaries.  Accordingly, the operations of the Hotel portion of the Hotel Pennsylvania and the operations of the management companies (which provide services to the Company's business segments and operate the Trade Show business of the Merchandise Mart division) have been consolidated effective January 1, 2001.  Amounts for the year ended December 31, 2000 have been reclassified to give effect to the consolidation of these entities, as of January 1, 2000.  The effect of these reclassifications in 2000 was as follows:
 
 
These reclassifications had no effect on reported Net Income or EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2000 and no impact to any other year.
Notes:
 
EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income.  EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.  In addition, the Company has revised EBITDA as previously reported for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 to include income from the early extinguishment of debt of $1,170 in 2001 and expense from the early extinguishment of debt of $1,125 in 2000 because such items are no longer treated as Extraordinary Items in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

Interest and Other Investment Income
 
Interest and other investment income (interest income on mortgage loans receivable, other interest income and dividend income) was $31,685,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $54,385,000 in the year ended December 31, 2001, a decrease of $22,700,000.  This decrease resulted primarily from a decrease of (i) $12,347,000 due to the non-recognition of income on the mortgage loan to Primestone, which was foreclosed on April 30, 2002, (ii) $4,626,000 due to a lower yield on the investment of the proceeds received from the May 2002 repayment of the Company's loan to NorthStar Partnership L.P.

Primestone Foreclosure and Impairment Losses
 
On September 28, 2000, the Company made a $62,000,000 loan to Primestone Investment Partners, L.P. ("Primestone"). The Company received a 1% up-front fee and was entitled to receive certain other fees aggregating approximately 3% upon repayment of the loan. The loan bore interest at 16% per annum.  Primestone defaulted on the repayment of this loan on October 25, 2001. The loan was subordinate to $37,957,000 of other debt of the borrower that liened the Company's collateral. On October 31, 2001, the Company purchased the other debt for its face amount.  The loans were secured by 7,944,893 partnership units in Prime Group Realty, L.P., the operating partnership of Prime Group Realty Trust (NYSE:PGE) and the partnership units are exchangeable for the same number of common shares of PGE.  The loans are also guaranteed by affiliates of Primestone.
 
On November 19, 2001, the Company sold, pursuant to a participation agreement with a subsidiary of Cadim inc., a Canadian pension fund, a 50% participation in both loans at par for approximately $50,000,000 reducing the Company's net investment in the loans at December 31, 2001 to $56,768,000 including unpaid interest and fees of $6,790,000.  The participation did not meet the criteria for "sale accounting" under SFAS 140 because Cadim was not free to pledge or exchange the assets.  Accordingly, the Company was required to account for this transaction as a borrowing secured by the loan, rather than as a sale of the loan by classifying the participation as an "Other Liability" and continuing to report the outstanding loan balance at 100% in "Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable" on the balance sheet.  Under the terms of the participation agreement, cash payments received shall be applied (i) first, to the reimbursement of reimbursable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the servicing, administration or enforcement of the loans after November 19, 2001, and then to interest and fees owed to the Company through November 19, 2001, (ii) second, to the Company and Cadim, pro rata in proportion to the amount of interest and fees owed following November 19, 2001 and (iii) third, 50% to the Company and 50% to Cadim as recovery of principal.
 
On April 30, 2002, the Company and Cadim acquired the 7,944,893 partnership units at a foreclosure auction.  The price paid for the units by application of a portion of Primestone's indebtedness to the Company and Cadim was $8.35 per unit, the April 30, 2002 closing price of shares of PGE on the New York Stock Exchange.  On June 28, 2002, pursuant to the terms of the participation agreement, the Company transferred 3,972,447 of the partnership units to Cadim.
 
In the second quarter, in accordance with foreclosure accounting, the Company recorded a loss on the Primestone foreclosure of $17,671,000 calculated based on (i) the acquisition price of the units and (ii) its valuation of the amounts realizable under the guarantees by affiliates of Primestone, as compared with the net carrying amount of the investment at April 30, 2002.  In the third quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a $2,229,000 write-down on its investment based on costs expended to realize the value of the guarantees.  Further, in the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a $15,857,000 write-down of its investment in Prime Group consisting of (i) $14,857,000 to adjust the carrying amount of the Prime Group units to $4.61 per unit, the closing price of PGE shares on the New York Stock Exchange at December 31, 2002 and (ii) $1,000,000 for estimated costs to realize the value of the guarantees.  The Company considered the decline in the value of the units which are convertible into stock to be other than temporary as of December 31, 2002, based on the fact that the market value of the stock has been less than its cost for more than six months, the severity of the decline, market trends, the financial condition and near-term prospects of Prime Group and other relevant factors.
 
At December 31, 2002, the Company's carrying amount of the investment was $23,908,000, of which $18,313,000 represents the carrying amount of the 3,972,447 partnership units owned by the Company ($4.61 per unit), $6,100,000 represents the amount expected to be realized under the guarantees, partially offset by $1,005,000 representing the Company's share of Prime Group Realty's net loss through September 30, 2002 (see Note 5. Investments in Partially-Owned Entities).
 
At February 3, 2003, the closing price of PGE shares on the New York Stock Exchange was $5.30 per share.  The ultimate realization of the Company's investment will depend upon the future performance of the Chicago real estate market and the performance of PGE, as well as the ultimate realizable value of the net assets supporting the guarantees and the Company's ability to collect under the guarantees.  In addition, the Company will continue to monitor this investment to determine whether additional write-downs are required based on (i) declines in value of the shares of PGE (for which the partnership units are exchangeable) which are "other than temporary" as used in accounting literature and (ii) the amount expected to be realized under the guarantees.
Discontinued Operations
 
Assets related to discontinued operations at December 31, 2002, represents the Company's New York City office property located at Two Park Avenue and retail properties located in Vineland, New Jersey, Baltimore, Maryland and Hagerstown, Maryland.

In September 1998, Atlantic City condemned the Company's property.  In the third quarter of 1998, the Company recorded a gain of $1,694,000, which reflected the condemnation award of $3,100,000, net of the carrying value of the property of $1,406,000.

On May 17, 2001, the Company sold its 50% interest in 570 Lexington Avenue for $60,000,000, resulting in a gain of $12,445,000.
 
During 2000, the Company sold (i) its three shopping centers located in Texas for $25,750,000, resulting in a gain of $2,560,000 and (ii) its Westport, Connecticut office property for $24,000,000, resulting in a gain of $8,405,000.
 
Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle

This write-off was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in 2002.
 
Minority Interest
 
Minority interest was $140,584,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $112,363,000 for the prior year, an increase of $28,221,000.  This increase is primarily due to operating partnership units issued in connection with acquisitions.
EBITDA
 
Below are the details of the changes by segment in EBITDA.
 
 
Represents operations which were owned for the same period in each year and excludes non-recurring income and expenses.
(1)
         
EBITDA and the same store percentage increase was $316,963 and 5.0% for the New York City office portfolio and $289,657 and 4.1% for the CESCR portfolio.
(2)
         
Primarily due to lower occupancy and increases in allowances for bad debt expense as a result of the K-Mart and other bankruptcies and the expiration of the Stop & Shop guarantees of several former Bradlees locations.  Average occupancy for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 88.3% (84.0% excluding leases which have not commenced as described in the following sentences) as compared to 92% at December 31, 2001.  The 88.3% occupancy rate includes leases for 490,000 square feet at five locations which have not commenced as of December 31, 2002.  Three of these locations aggregating 268,000 square feet are ground leased to Lowe's which plans to demolish the existing buildings and construct its own stores at the sites and two locations containing 223,000 square feet are leased to Wal-Mart, which plans to demolish an existing building and construct its own store at one of the sites and occupy the existing store at the other site.  All of these redevelopment projects are subject to governmental approvals and in some cases, the relocation of existing tenants.
(3)
         
Primarily due to the Company's share of losses from the Starwood Ceruzzi venture in 2002 of $1,416 (before depreciation) from properties placed in service, as compared to a gain of $1,394 from the sale of one of the venture's assets in 2001.  EBITDA aggregating $2,600 from the acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2002 of a 50% interest in the Monmouth Mall and the remaining 50% interest in the Las Catalinas Mall the Company did not previously own, was offset by lease termination fees and other refunds in the fourth quarter of 2001.
(4)
         
The net of a $1,685 or 1.5% same store increase in the core portfolio and a $3,300 or a 66% decline at the LA Mart as a result of rent reductions and increased marketing expenditures.
(5)
         
The Company reflects its 60% share of Vornado Crescent Portland Partnership's ("the Landlord") rental income it receives from AmeriCold Logistics, its tenant, which leases the underlying temperature controlled warehouses used in its business.  The Company's joint venture does not recognize rental income unless earned and collection is assured or cash is received.  The Company did not recognize its $19,349 share of the rent the joint venture was due for the year ended December 31, 2002.  The tenant has advised the Landlord that (i) its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 from the warehouses it leases from the Landlord, is lower than last year by .1%, and (ii) its gross profit before rent at these warehouses for the corresponding period decreased by $614 (a .001% decrease).  The decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to a reduction in customer inventory turns, a rate reduction with a significant customer and temporary plant shut-downs.  The decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable to higher insurance and workers' compensation.  In addition, the tenant's cash requirements for capital expenditures, debt service and a non-recurring pension funding were $8,293 higher in the current year than in the prior year, which impacted the ability of the tenant to pay rent.
(6)
         
The decrease in same store operations was primarily due to (i) a $14,973 reduction in investment income and (ii) a $9,342 reduction in operating results at the Hotel Pennsylvania, partially offset by (iii) additional development and commitment fees from Alexander's and (iv) income from the Newkirk MLP.  The reduction in investment income is primarily due to the reinvestment of the proceeds received from the repayment of the Company's $75,000 loan to NorthStar Partnership LP. in May 2002 at lower yields (1.5% vs. 22%) and not recognizing income on the Company's foreclosed loan to Primestone and outstanding loan to Vornado Operating.  The Hotel Pennsylvania's operating results reflect a reduction in average occupancy and REVPAR to 65% and $58 for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to 63% and $70 for the year ended December 31, 2001.
(7)
         
Reflects net non-recurring items included in EBITDA (see page 13 footnote 2 for details)

Years Ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000
 
Revenues
 
The Company's revenues, which consist of property rentals, tenant expense reimbursements and other income, were $953,321,000 in the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $893,969,000 in the prior year, an increase of $59,352,000.  These increases by segment resulted from:
 
 
Results primarily from the 14th Street and Union Square property being taken out of service for redevelopment on February 9, 2001 and the sale of the Company's Texas properties on March 2, 2000.
(1)
          
Results primarily from the termination of the Sports Authority lease at the Hotel Pennsylvania in January 2001.
(2)
          
Average occupancy and REVPAR for the Hotel Pennsylvania were 63% and $70 for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 76% and $87 for the year ended December 31, 2000.
(3)
          
Reflects a decrease of $2,514 in property rentals arising from the straight-lining of rent escalations.
(4)
          
 
Expenses
 
The Company's expenses were $583,572,000 in the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $533,899,000 in the prior year, an increase of $49,673,000.  This increase by segment resulted from:
 
 
Includes $1,900 for the collection of a receivable from a commercial tenant of the Hotel in 2001 which was previously fully reserved.
(1)
              
 
Income Applicable to Alexander's
 
Income applicable to Alexander's (loan interest income, management, leasing and development fees, and equity in income) was $25,718,000 in the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $17,363,000 in the prior year, an increase of $8,355,000.  This increase resulted primarily from the Company's share of Alexander's gain on sale of its Fordham Road property on January 12, 2001.
Income from Partially-Owned Entities
 
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company reflects the income it receives from (i) entities it owns less than 50% of and (ii) entities it owns more than 50% of, but which have a partner who has shared board and management representation and authority and substantive participating rights on all significant business decisions, on the equity method of accounting resulting in such income appearing on one line in the Company's consolidated statements of income. Below is the detail of income from partially-owned entities by investment as well as the increase (decrease) in income from partially-owned entities for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to the prior year:
 
Interest and Other Investment Income
 
Interest and other investment income (interest income on mortgage loans receivable, other interest income, dividend income and net gains on marketable securities) was $54,385,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $33,681,000 in the prior year, an increase of $20,704,000.  This increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of NorthStar subordinated unsecured debt (22% effective rate) on September 19, 2000 and a loan to Primestone Investment Partners, L.P. on September 28, 2000 (20% effective rate).
 
On September 28, 2000, the Company made a $62,000,000 loan to Primestone Investment Partners, L.P.  The Company received a 1% upfront fee and is entitled to receive certain other fees aggregating approximately 3% upon repayment of the loan.  The loan bears interest at 16% per annum. Primestone Investment Partners, L.P. defaulted on the repayment of this loan on October 25, 2001.  The Company's loan was subordinate to $37,957,000 of other debt of the borrower that liened the Company's collateral.  On October 31, 2001, the Company purchased the other debt for its face amount.  The loans are secured by 7,944,893 partnership units in Prime Group Realty, L.P., the operating partnership of Prime Group Realty Trust (NYSE:PGE), which units are exchangeable for the same number of shares of PGE.  The loans are also guaranteed by affiliates of the borrower. The Company has commenced foreclosure proceedings with respect to the collateral.
 
On November 19, 2001 the Company sold, pursuant to a participation agreement with a subsidiary of Cadim inc., a Canadian pension fund, a 50% participation in both loans at par for approximately $50,000,000 reducing the Company's net investment in the loans at December 31, 2001 to $56,768,000 including unpaid interest and fees of $6,790,000.  Under the terms of the participation agreement, cash payments received shall be applied (i) first, to the reimbursement of reimbursable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the servicing, administration or enforcement of the loans after November 19, 2001, (ii) second, to the Company and Cadim pro rata in proportion to the amount of interest and fees owed to them (all of such fees and interest accrued through November 19, 2001 are for the account of Vornado and all of such fees and interest accrued after November 19, 2001 accrue on a 50/50 basis to the Company and Cadim) and (iii) third, 50% to the Company and 50% to Cadim.  The Company has agreed that in the event the Company acquires the collateral in a foreclosure proceeding it will, upon the request of Cadim, deliver 50% of such collateral to Cadim.
 
For financial reporting at December 31, 2002, purposes, the gross amount of the loan, $106,768,000, is included in "Notes and mortgage loans receivable" and Cadim's 50% participation, $50,000,000, is reflected in "Other liabilities".  The Company did not recognize income on these loans for the period from November 19, 2001 through December 31, 2001, and will not recognize income until such time that cash is received or foreclosure proceedings have been consummated.
 
Included in interest and other investment income for the year ended December 31, 2001, is $2,422,000 of interest income from the $31,424,000 note receivable the Company has from Vornado Operating.  Vornado Operating has only one significant asset, its investment in AmeriCold Logistics and does not generate positive cash flow sufficient to cover all of its expenses.  Accordingly, commencing January 1, 2002, the Company will no longer recognize the interest income due on the $31,424,000 loan until Vornado Operating is cash flow positive in an amount sufficient to fund the interest due to the Company.
 
Interest and Debt Expense
 
Interest and debt expense was $167,430,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $173,432,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $6,002,000.  This decrease resulted primarily from a $36,270,000 savings from a 289 basis point reduction in weighted average interest rate on variable rate debt partially offset by interest on higher average outstanding loan balances.  Interest and debt expense includes amortization of debt issuance costs of $8,458,000 and $8,423,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.

Write-off Investments in Technology Companies
In the first quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $4,723,000 resulting from the write-off of an equity investment in a technology company.  In the second quarter of 2001, the Company recorded an additional charge of $13,561,000 resulting from the write-off of all of its remaining equity investments in technology companies due to both the deterioration of the financial condition of these companies and the lack of acceptance by the market of certain of their products and services.  In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded $1,481,000 of income resulting from the reversal of a deferred rent liability relating to the termination of an agreement permitting one of the technology companies access to its properties.
 
After-tax Net Gain on Sale of Park Laurel Condominium Units
In the third and fourth quarters of 2001, the Park Laurel Joint Venture (69% interest owned by the Company) completed the sale of 52 condominium units of the total 53 units and received proceeds of $139,548,000.  The Company's share of the after tax net gain was $15,657,000 and is after a charge of $3,953,000 (net of tax benefit of $1,826,000) for awards accrued under the venture's incentive compensation plan.
 
Write-off of Net Investment in RTR
In the third quarter of 2001, the Company wrote-off its entire net investment of $7,374,000 in RTR based on the operating losses and an assessment of the value of the real estate.
Discontinued Operations
 
Assets related to discontinued operations at December 31, 2002 represents the Company's New York City office property located at Two Park Avenue and retail properties located in Vineland, New Jersey, Baltimore, Maryland and Hagerstown, Maryland.  The following is a summary of the combined results of operations of these properties:
 
 
 
Gains on Sale of Real Estate
 
In September 1998, Atlantic City condemned the Company's property.  In the third quarter of 1998, the Company recorded a gain of $1,694,000, which reflected the condemnation award of $3,100,000, net of the carrying value of the property of $1,406,000.  The Company appealed the amount and on June 27, 2001, was awarded an additional $3,050,000, which has been recorded as a gain in the quarter ended June 30, 2001.
 
On August 6, 2001, the Company sold its leasehold interest in 550/600 Mamaroneck Avenue for $22,500,000, which approximated its net book value.
 
On May 17, 2001, the Company sold its 50% interest in 570 Lexington Avenue for $60,000,000, resulting in a gain of $12,445,000.
 
During 2000, the Company sold (i) its three shopping centers located in Texas for $25,750,000, resulting in a gain of $2,560,000 and (ii) its Westport, Connecticut office property for $24,000,000, resulting in a gain of $8,405,000.
Other
 
The Company recorded the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $4,110,000 in the first quarter of 2001.  The Company had previously marked-to-market changes in the value of stock purchase warrants through accumulated other comprehensive loss.  Under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, those changes are recognized through earnings, and accordingly, the Company has reclassified $4,110,000 from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the consolidated statement of income as of January 1, 2001.  Future changes in value of such securities will be recorded through earnings.
 
Minority interest was $112,363,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $102,374,000 for the prior year, an increase of $9,989,000.  This increase is primarily due to an increase in perpetual preferred units distributions for units issued in 2000 and 2001.
 
EBITDA
 
Below are the details of the changes by segment in EBITDA.
 
 
Represents operations which were owned for the same period in each year.
(1)
         
EBITDA and the same store percentage increase was $325,204 and 13.7% for the New York City office portfolio and $84,639 and 3.6% for the CESCR portfolio.
(2)
         
The tenant has reported that (i) its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 from the warehouses it leases from the Landlord, is lower than last year by 4.2% and (ii) its gross profit before rent at these warehouses for the corresponding period is lower than last year by $26,764 (a 14.4% decline).  This decrease is attributable to a reduction in total customer inventory stored at the warehouses and customer inventory turns.
(3)
         
Based on the Landlord's policy of recognizing rental income when earned and collection is assured or cash is received, the Company did not recognize $15,281 and $8,606 of the rent it was due in the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.  On December 31, 2001 the Landlord released the tenant from its obligation to pay $39,812 of deferred rent of which the Company's share was $23,887.  This amount equals the rent which was not recognized as income by the Company and accordingly had no profit and loss effect to the Company.
Included in "Other" is $2,422 of interest income from the $31,424 note receivable the Company has from Vornado Operating.  Vornado Operating has only one significant asset, its investment in AmeriCold Logistics and does not generate positive cash flow sufficient to cover all of its expenses.  Accordingly, commencing January 1, 2002, the Company no longer recognizes interest income due on the $31,424 loan until Vornado Operating is cash flow positive in an amount sufficient to fund the interest due to the Company.

Loan and Compensation Agreements
 
At December 31, 2002, the loan due from Mr. Roth, in accordance with his employment arrangement, was $13,122,500 ($4,704,500 of which is shown as a reduction in shareholders' equity).  The loan bears interest at 4.49 % per annum (based on the applicable Federal rate) and matures in January 2006.  The Company also provided Mr. Roth with the right to draw up to $15,000,000 of additional loans on a revolving basis.  Each additional loan will bear interest, payable quarterly, at the applicable Federal rate on the date the loan is made and will mature on the sixth anniversary of the loan.
 
On May 29, 2002, Mr. Roth replaced common shares of the Company securing the Company's outstanding loan to Mr. Roth with options to purchase common shares of the Company with a value of not less than two times the loan amount.  As a result of the decline in the value of the options, Mr. Roth supplemented the collateral with cash and marketable securities.
 
At December 31, 2002, loans due from Mr. Fascitelli, in accordance with his employment agreement, aggregated $8,600,000.  The loans, which were scheduled to mature in 2003, have been extended to 2006 in connection with the extension of Mr. Fascitelli's employment agreement (discussed below) and bear interest, payable quarterly at a weighted average interest rate of 3.97% (based on the applicable Federal rate).
 
Pursuant to his 1996 employment agreement, Mr. Fascitelli became entitled to a deferred payment consisting of $5 million in cash and a convertible obligation payable November 30, 2001, at the Company's option, in either 919,540 Company common shares or the cash equivalent of their appreciated value, so long as such appreciated value is not less than $20 million.  The Company delivered 919,540 shares to a rabbi trust upon execution of the 1996 employment agreement.  The Company accounted for the stock compensation as a variable arrangement in accordance with Plan B of EITF No. 97-14 "Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where Amounts Earned Are Held in a Rabbi Trust and Invested" as the agreement permitted settlement in either cash or common shares.  Following the guidance in EITF 97-14, the Company recorded changes in fair value of its compensation obligation with a corresponding increase in the liability "Officer's Deferred Compensation".  Effective as of June 7, 2001, the payment date was deferred until November 30, 2004.  Effective as of December 14, 2001, the payment to Mr. Fascitelli was converted into an obligation to deliver a fixed number of shares (919,540 shares), establishing a measurement date for the Company's stock compensation obligation, accordingly the Company ceased accounting for the Rabbi Trust under Plan B of the EITF and began Plan A accounting.  Under Plan A, the accumulated liability representing the value of the shares on December 14, 2001, was reclassified as a component of Shareholders' Equity as "Deferred compensation shares earned but not yet delivered."  In addition, future changes in the value of the shares are no longer recognized as additional compensation expense.  The fair value of this obligation was $34,207,000 at December 31, 2002.  The Company has reflected this liability as Deferred Compensation Shares Not Yet Delivered in the Shareholders' Equity section of the balance sheet.  For the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company recognized approximately $4,744,000 and $3,733,000 of compensation expense of which $2,612,000 and $1,968,000 represented the appreciation in value of the shares in each period and $2,132,000 and $1,765,000 represented dividends paid on the shares.
 
Effective January 1, 2002, the Company extended its employment agreement with Mr. Fascitelli for a five-year period through December 31, 2006.  Pursuant to the extended employment agreement, Mr. Fascitelli is entitled to receive a deferred payment on December 31, 2006 of 626,566 Vornado common shares which are valued for compensation purposes at $27,500,000 (the value of the shares on March 8, 2002, the date the extended employment agreement was executed).  The shares are held in a rabbi trust for the benefit of Mr. Fascitelli and vested 100% on December 31, 2002.  The extended employment agreement does not permit diversification, allows settlement of the deferred compensation obligation by delivery of these shares only, and permits the deferred delivery of these shares.  The value of these shares was amortized ratably over the one year vesting period as compensation expense.
 
Pursuant to the Company's annual compensation review in February 2002 with Joseph Macnow, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, the Compensation Committee approved a $2,000,000 loan to Mr. Macnow, bearing interest at the applicable federal rate of 4.65% per annum and due January 1, 2006.  The loan, which was funded on July 23, 2002, was made in conjunction with Mr. Macnow's June 2002 exercise of options to purchase 225,000 shares of the Company's common stock.  The loan is collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the loan amount.  As a result of the decline in the value of the options, Mr. Macnow supplemented the collateral with cash and marketable securities.
 
One other executive officer of the Company has a loan outstanding pursuant to an employment agreement totaling  $1,500,000 at December 31, 2002.  The loan matures in April 2005 and bears interest at the applicable Federal rate provided (4.5% at December 31, 2002).
Transactions with Affiliates and Officers and Trustees of the Company
 
Alexander's
 
The Company owns 33.1% of Alexander's.  Mr. Roth and Mr. Fascitelli are Officers and Directors of Alexander's, the Company provides various services to Alexander's in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements and the Company has made loans to Alexander's aggregating $119,000,000 at December 31, 2002.  These agreements and the loans are described in Note 5 to the Company's consolidated financial statements  Investments in Partially-Owned Entities in this report on form 8-K.
 
The Company constructed a $16.3 million community facility and low-income residential housing development (the "30th Street Venture"), in order to receive 163,728 square feet of transferable development rights, generally referred to as "air rights".  The Company donated the building to a charitable organization.  The Company sold 106,796 square feet of these air rights to third parties at an average price of $120 per square foot.  An additional 28,821 square feet of air rights was sold to Alexander's at a price of $120 per square foot for use at Alexander's 59th Street development project (the "59th Street Project").  In each case, the Company received cash in exchange for air rights.  The Company identified third party buyers for the remaining 28,111 square feet of air rights related to the 30th Street Venture.  These third party buyers wanted to use the air rights for the development of two projects located in the general area of 86th Street which was not within the required geographical radius of the construction site nor in the same Community Board as the low-income housing and community facility project.  The 30th Street Venture asked Alexander's to sell 28,111 square feet of the air rights it already owned to the third party buyers (who could use them) and the 30th Street Venture would replace them with 28,111 square feet of air rights.  In October 2002, the Company sold 28,111 square feet of air rights to Alexander's for an aggregate sales price of $3,059,000 (an average of $109 per square foot).  Alexander's then sold an equal amount of air rights to the third party buyers for an aggregate sales price of $3,339,000 (an average of $119 per square foot).
 
Interstate Properties
 
The Company manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate Properties pursuant to a management agreement for which the Company receives an annual fee equal to 4% of base rent and percentage rent and certain other commissions. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days' notice at the end of the term. Although the management agreement was not negotiated at arms length, the Company believes based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies that its terms are fair to the Company. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, $1,450,000, $1,655,000, and $1,418,000 of management fees were earned by the Company pursuant to the management agreement.
 
Building Maintenance Service Company ("BMS")
 
On January 1, 2003, the Company acquired BMS, a company which provides cleaning and related services primarily to the Company's Manhattan office properties, for $13,000,000 in cash from the estate of Bernard Mendik and certain other individuals including Mr. Greenbaum, one of the Company's executive officers.  The Company paid BMS $53,024,000, $51,280,000, and $47,493,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 for services rendered at the Company's Manhattan office properties.  Although the terms and conditions of the contracts pursuant to which these services were provided were not negotiated at arms length, the Company believes based upon comparable amounts charged to other real estate companies that the terms and conditions of the contracts were fair to the Company.
 
Vornado Operating Company and AmeriCold Logistics
 
In October 1998, Vornado Operating was spun off from the Company in order to own assets that the Company could not itself own and conduct activities that the Company could not itself conduct.  The Company granted Vornado Operating a $75,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility which expires on December 31, 2004.  Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 3%.  The Company receives a commitment fee equal to 1% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the facility.  No amortization is required to be paid under the revolving credit facility during its term.  The revolving credit facility prohibits Vornado Operating from incurring indebtedness to third parties (other than certain purchase money debt and certain other exceptions) and prohibits Vornado Operating from paying dividends.  As of December 31, 2002, $21,989,000 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
Vornado Operating has disclosed that in the aggregate its investments do not, and for the foreseeable future are not expected to, generate sufficient cash flow to pay all of its debts and expenses.  Further, Vornado Operating states that its only investee, AmeriCold Logistics ("Tenant"), anticipates that its Landlord, a partnership 60% owned by the Company and 40% owned by Crescent Real Estate Equities, will need to restructure the leases between the Landlord and the Tenant to provide additional cash flow to the Tenant (the Landlord has previously restructured the leases to provide additional cash flow to the Tenant).  Management anticipates a further lease restructuring and the sale and/or financing of assets by AmeriCold Logistics, and accordingly, Vornado Operating is expected to have a source to repay the debt under this facility, which may be extended.  Since January 1, 2002, the Company has not recognized interest income on the debt under this facility.
 
On December 31, 2002, the Company and Crescent Real Estate Equities formed a joint venture to acquire the Carthage, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas quarries from AmeriCold Logistics, the Company's tenant at the cold storage warehouses (Temperature Controlled Logistics), for $20,000,000 in cash (appraised value).  The Company contributed cash of $8,800,000 to the joint venture representing its 44% interest.  AmeriCold Logistics used the proceeds from the sale to repay a portion of a loan to Vornado Operating.  Vornado Operating then repaid $9,500,000 of the amount outstanding under the Company's revolving credit facility.  On December 31, 2002, the joint venture purchased $5,720,000 of trade receivables from AmeriCold at a 2% discount, of which the Company's share was $2,464,000.
 
Other
 
The Company owns preferred securities in Capital Trust, Inc. ("Capital Trust") totaling $29,212,000 at December 31, 2002.  Mr. Roth, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado Realty Trust, is a member of the Board of Directors of Capital Trust nominated by the Company.
 
On May 17, 2001, the Company sold its 50% interest in 570 Lexington Avenue to the other venture partner, an entity controlled by the late Bernard Mendik, a former trustee and executive officer of the Company, for $60,000,000, resulting in a gain to the Company of $12,445,000.  The sale was initiated by the Company's partner and was based on a competitive bidding process handled by an independent broker.  The Company believes that the terms of the sale was at arm's length and were fair to the Company.
 
During 2002 and 2001, the Company paid approximately $147,000 and $136,000 for legal services to a firm in which one of the Company's trustees is a member.
 
On January 1, 2001, the Company acquired the common stock of various preferred stock affiliates which was owned by Officers and Trustees of the Company and converted the affiliates to taxable REIT subsidiaries.  The total acquisition price was $5,155,000.  The purchase price, which was the estimated fair value, was determined by both independent appraisal and by reference to the individuals' pro rata share of the earnings of the preferred stock affiliates during the three-year period that these investments were held.

The Company currently expects to continue to grow. However, its ability to do so will be dependent on a number of factors, including, among others, (a) the availability of reasonably priced assets that meet the Company's acquisition criteria and (b) the price of the Company's common shares, the rates at which the Company is able to borrow money and, more generally, the availability of financing on terms that, in the Company's view, make such acquisitions financially attractive.

Funds From Operations For
The Years Ended December 31, 2002 And 2001
 
Funds from operations was $439,775,000 or $3.91 per diluted share in the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $394,532,000 or $3.96 per diluted share in the prior year, an increase of $45,243,000.  In order to report FFO in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's recent Regulation G concerning non-GAAP financial measures, adhere to NAREIT's definition of FFO and to disclose FFO on a comparable basis with the vast majority of other companies in the industry, the Company has revised its definition of funds from operations to include both the effect of income arising from the straight-lining of rents and income from the amortization of acquired below market leases net of above market leases.  Income from the straight-lining of rents amounted to $27,295,000, or $.24 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2002, and $24,314,000, or $.24 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2001.  Income from the amortization of acquired below market leases net of above market leases amounted to $12,634,000, or $.11 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $0 for the year ended December 31, 2001.  Such amounts are included in reported FFO above.
 
Funds from operations includes certain items which effect comparability totaling $41,216,000(1) or $.36 per diluted share and $12,903,000(1) or $.13 per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001.  Funds from operations before these items and after minority interest was $480,991,000 in the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $407,435,000 in the prior year, a $73,556,000 increase over the prior year, or a 4.4% increase on a per share basis.
 
The following table reconciles funds from operations and net income:
 
 
The number of shares used for determining funds from operations per share is as follows:
 
Funds from Operations ("FFO") does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs which is disclosed in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the applicable periods.  FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company's operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.  Management considers FFO a relevant supplemental measure of operating performance because it provides a basis for comparison among REITs.  FFO is computed in accordance with NAREIT's definition, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with NAREIT's definition.
 
Certain items which affect comparability included in funds from operations above are as follows:
(1)
                  
 
Certain Future Cash Requirements
 
For 2003, the Company has budgeted approximately $197.3 million for capital expenditures (excluding acquisitions) and leasing commissions as follows:

Primarily for the Hotel Pennsylvania.
(2)
              
 
In addition to the capital expenditures reflected above, the Company is currently engaged in certain development and redevelopment projects for which it has budgeted approximately $230.9 million to be expended as outlined in the "Development and Redevelopment Projects" section of Item 1Business.  The $230.9 million does not include amounts for other projects which are also included in the "Development and Redevelopment Projects" section of Item 1 -Business, as no budgets for them have been finalized.  There can be no assurance that any of the above projects will be ultimately completed, completed on time or completed for the budgeted amount.
 
No cash requirements have been budgeted for the capital expenditures and amortization of debt of Alexander's, The Newkirk MLP, or any other entity that is partially owned by the Company.  These investees are expected to fund their own cash requirements.

The Company is reviewing various alternatives for the repayment or refinancing of debt coming due during 2003.  The Company has $1 billion available under its revolving credit facility which matures in July 2003 and a number of properties which are unencumbered.
 
The Company's credit facility contains customary conditions precedent to borrowing such as the bring down of customary representations and warranties as well as compliance with financial covenants such as minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization.  The facility provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in the Company's ratings below Baa3/BBB.  This facility also contains customary events of default which could give rise to acceleration and include such items as failure to pay interest or principal and breaches of financial covenants such as maintenance of minimum capitalization and minimum interest coverage.
 
The Company carries comprehensive liability and all risk property insurance (fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance) with respect to its assets.  The Company's all risk insurance policies in effect before September 11, 2001 do not expressly exclude coverage for hostile acts, except for acts of war.  Since September 11, 2001, insurance companies have for the most part excluded terrorist acts from coverage in all risk policies.  The Company has generally been unable to obtain all risk insurance which includes coverage for terrorist acts for policies it has renewed since September 11, 2001, for each of its businesses.  In 2002, the Company obtained $200,000,000 of separate coverage for terrorist acts for each of its New York City Office, Washington, D.C. Office, Retail and Merchandise Mart businesses and $60,000,000 for its Temperature Controlled Logistics business.  Therefore, the Company is at risk for financial loss in excess of these limits for terrorist acts (as defined), which loss could be material.
 
The Company's debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by its properties (which are generally non-recourse to the Company), its senior unsecured notes due 2007 and its revolving credit agreement, contain customary covenants requiring the Company to maintain insurance.  There can be no assurance that the lenders under these instruments will not take the position that an exclusion from all risk insurance coverage for losses due to terrorist acts is a breach of these debt instruments that allows the lenders to declare an event of default and accelerate repayment of debt.  The Company has received correspondence from four lenders regarding terrorism insurance coverage, which the Company has responded to.  In these letters the lenders took the position that under the agreements governing the loans provided by these lenders the Company was required to maintain terrorism insurance on the properties securing the various loans.  The aggregate amount of borrowings under these loans as of December 31, 2002 was approximately $770.4 million, and there was no additional borrowing capacity.  Subsequently, the Company obtained an aggregate of $360 million of separate coverage for "terrorist acts".  To date, one of the lenders has acknowledged to the Company that it will not raise any further questions based on the Company's terrorism insurance coverage in place, and the other three lenders have not raised any further questions regarding the Company's insurance coverage.  If lenders insist on greater coverage for these risks, it could adversely affect the Company's ability to finance and/or refinance its properties and to expand its portfolio.
On November 26, 2002, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 was signed into law.  Under this new legislation, through 2004 (with a possible extension through 2005), regulated insurers must offer coverage in their commercial property and casualty policies (including existing policies) for losses resulting from defined "acts of terrorism".  The Company cannot currently anticipate whether the scope and cost of such coverage will be commercially reasonable.  As a result of the legislation, in February 2003 the Company obtained $300 million of per occurrence coverage for terrorist acts for its New York City Office, Washington, D.C. Office and Merchandise Mart businesses, of which $240 million is for Certified Acts, as defined in the legislation.  The Company maintains $200 million and $60 million of separate aggregate coverage that it had in 2002 for each of its Retail and Temperature Controlled Logistics businesses (which has been renewed as of January 1, 2003).  The Company's current Retail property insurance carrier has advised the Company that there will be an additional premium of approximately $11,000 per month through the end of the policy term (June 30, 2003) for "Acts of Terrorism" coverage, as defined in the new legislation and that the situation may change upon renewal.
 
In addition, many of the Company's non-recourse mortgages contain debt service covenants which if not satisfied could require cash collateral.  These covenants are not "ratings" related.
 
In conjunction with the closing of Alexander's Lexington Avenue construction loan on July 3, 2002, the Company agreed to guarantee, among other things, the lien free, timely completion of the construction of the project and funding of all project costs in excess of a stated budget, as defined in the loan agreement, if not funded by Alexander's.
 
Corporate
 
On June 24, 2002, the Company completed an offering of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2007.  Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on June 15th and December 15th,commencing December 15, 2002.  The net proceeds of approximately $496,300,000 were used to repay the mortgages on 350 North Orleans, Two Park Avenue, the Merchandise Mart and Seven Skyline.  On June 27, 2002, the Company entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the interest rate on the $500,000,000 senior unsecured notes due 2007 from a fixed rate of 5.625% to a floating rate of LIBOR plus .7725%, based upon the trailing 3 month LIBOR rate (2.5% if set on December 31, 2002).
 
On February 25, 2002, the Company sold 884,543 common shares to a closed-end fund and 514,200 shares to a unit investment trust based on the closing price of $42.96 on the NYSE.  The net proceeds to the Company were approximately $57,042,000.
 
The Company has an effective shelf registration under which the Company can offer an aggregate of approximately $895,479,000 of equity securities and Vornado Realty L.P. can offer an aggregate of $500,720,000 of debt securities.
 
The Company anticipates that cash from continuing operations will be adequate to fund business operations and the payment of dividends and distributions on an on-going basis for more than the next twelve months; however, capital outlays for significant acquisitions will require funding from borrowings or equity offerings.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
 
SFAS No. 141 - Business Combinations
 
SFAS No. 141 - requires companies to account for the value of leases acquired and the costs of acquiring such leases separately from the value of the real estate for all acquisitions subsequent to July 1, 2001.  Accordingly, the Company has evaluated the leases in place for (i) the remaining 66% of CESCR it did not previously own which it acquired on January 1, 2002, (ii) the remaining 50% of the Las Catalinas Mall it did not previously own which it acquired on September 23, 2002 and (iii) a 50% interest in the Monmouth Mall which it acquired on October 10, 2002; to determine whether they were acquired at market, above market or below market.  The Company's evaluations were based on (i) the differences between contractual rentals and the estimated market rents over the applicable lease term discounted back to the date of acquisition utilizing a discount rate adjusted for the credit risk associated with the respective tenants and (ii) the estimated cost of acquiring such leases giving effect to the Company's history of providing tenant improvements and paying leasing commissions.
Business Combinations
 
As a result of its evaluations, as of December 31, 2002, the Company has recorded a deferred credit of $48,430,000 representing the value of acquired below market leases, deferred charges of $15,976,000, for the value of acquired above market leases and $3,621,000 for origination costs.  In addition, in the year ended December 31, 2002 the Company has recognized property rentals of $12,634,000 for the amortization of below market leases net of above market leases, and depreciation expense of $1,214,000 for the amortization of the lease origination costs and additional building depreciation resulting from the reallocation of the purchase price of the applicable properties.
 
SFAS No. 142  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, (effective January 1, 2002).  SFAS No. 142 specifies that goodwill and some intangible assets will no longer be amortized but instead be subject to periodic impairment testing.  SFAS No. 142 provides specific guidance for impairment testing of these assets and removes them from the scope of SFAS No. 121, .  The Company's goodwill balance on December 31, 2001 of $30,129,000 consisted of $14,639,000 related to the Hotel Pennsylvania acquisition and $15,490,000 related to the acquisition of the Temperature Controlled Logistics businesses.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
 
Prior to January 1, 2002, the Company performed impairment testing in accordance with SFAS 121.  The Company reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Given the decrease in the estimated market values and the deteriorating performance of Hotel Pennsylvania and Temperature Controlled Logistics, the Company performed a review for recoverability estimating the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition.  As of December 31, 2001, the sum of the expected cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) exceeded the carrying amounts of goodwill, and therefore no impairments were recognized.
 
Upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002, the Company tested the goodwill for impairment at the reporting level unit utilizing the prescribed two-step method.  The first step compared the fair value of the reporting unit (determined based on a discounted cash flow approach) with its carrying amount.  As the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value, the second step of the impairment test was performed to measure the impairment loss.  The second step compared the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill.  As the carrying amounts of the goodwill exceeded the fair values, on January 1, 2002 the Company wrote-off all of the goodwill of the Hotel and the Temperature Controlled Logistics business as an impairment loss totaling $30,129,000.  The write-off has been reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on the income statement.  Earnings allocable to the minority interest has been reduced by their pro-rata share of the write-off of goodwill.
 
Previously reported "Income before gains on sale of real estate, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle" and "Net income applicable to common shares" for the year ended December 31, 2001 would have been approximately $972,000 higher, or $2.35 and $2.48 per diluted share, if such goodwill was not amortized in the prior year.
SFAS No. 143  Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations and SFAS No. 144  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
 
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, (effective January 1, 2003) and SFAS No. 144, (effective January 1, 2002).  SFAS No. 143 requires the recording of the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period which it is incurred.  SFAS No. 144 supersedes current accounting literature and now provides for a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale and requires discontinued operations presentation for disposals of a "component" of an entity.  In accordance with SFAS No. 144, for all periods presented, the Company reclassified its consolidated statements of operations to reflect income and expenses for properties which are held for sale as discontinued operations and reclassified its consolidated balance sheets to reflect assets and liabilities related to such properties as assets related to discontinued operations and liabilities related to discontinued operations.

In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, SFAS No. 145 requires, among other things, (i) that the modification of a lease that results in a change of the classification of the lease from capital to operating under the provisions of SFAS No. 13 be accounted for as a sale-leaseback transaction and (ii) the reporting of gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt as extraordinary items only if they met the criteria of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30,   The rescission of SFAS No. 4 is effective January 1, 2003.  The amendment of SFAS No. 13 is effective for transactions occurring on or after May 15, 2002. The adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

SFAS No. 146  Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
 
In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Associated(effective January 1, 2003).  SFAS No. 146 replaces current accounting literature and requires the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan.  The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

SFAS No. 148  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure  An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123
 
On August 7, 2002, the Company announced that beginning January 1, 2003, it will expense the cost of employee stock options in accordance with the SFAS No. 123,   In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148  to amend the transition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123.  Specifically, SFAS No. 123, as amended, would permit two additional transition methods for entities that adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation.  The Company will adopt SFAS No. 123 prospectively by valuing and accounting for employee stock options granted in 2003 and thereafter.  The Company will utilize a binomial valuation model and appropriate market assumptions to determine the value of each grant.  Stock-based compensation expense will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the respective grants.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45  , Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, which elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued.  The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this Interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002.  The Company believes that the adoption of this interpretation will not have a material effect to the Company's financial statements.

FASB Interpretation No. 46 
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
 
In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46  which requires the consolidation of an entity by an enterprise (i) if that enterprise, known as a "primary beneficiary", has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity's expected losses if they occur, receive a majority of the entity's expected residual returns if they occur, or both and (ii) if the entity is a variable interest entity, as defined by Interpretation No. 46.  An entity is a variable interest entity if (a) the total equity investment at risk in the entity is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or (b) the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest in the entity.  Interpretation No. 46 applies immediately to all variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003.  For variable interest entities created by public companies before February 1, 2003, Interpretation No. 46 must be applied no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003.  The initial determination of whether an entity is a variable interest entity shall be made as of the date at which a primary beneficiary becomes involved with the entity and reconsidered as of the date one of three triggering events described by Interpretation No. 46 occur.  The Company does not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material effect on its financial statements.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
                
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vornado Realty Trust and its majority-owned subsidiary, Vornado Realty L.P., as well as entities in which the Company has a 50% or greater interest, provided that the Company exercises direct or indirect control.  All significant intercompany amounts have been eliminated.  The Company considers the guidance in APB 18, SOP 78-9 and EITF 96-16 in determining whether it does or does not control joint ventures on a case-by-case basis, taking into account board representation, management representation and authority and the contractual and substantive participating rights of its partners/members.  If the approval of all of the partners/members is contractually required with respect to major decisions, such as operating and capital budgets, the sale, exchange or other disposition of any real property assets, the hiring of a Chief Executive Officer, the commencement, compromise or settlement of any lawsuit, legal proceeding or arbitration or the placement of any new or additional financing secured by any assets of the joint venture, then the Company does not control the venture and therefore will not consolidate the entity, despite the fact that it may own 50% or more of the relevant entity.  This is the case with respect to Temperature Controlled Logistics, Monmouth Mall, MartParc Orleans, MartParc Wells, 825 Seventh Avenue and Starwood Ceruzzi.  If the Company is able to unilaterally make major decisions for the partially owned entity and owns an interest greater than 50%, the Company has control and therefore consolidates the entity.  The Company accounts for investments under the equity method when the Company's ownership interest is more than 20% but less than 50% and the Company does not exercise direct or indirect control. When partially-owned investments are in partnership form, the 20% threshold may be reduced.  For all other investments, the Company uses the cost method.  Equity investments are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Company's share of the net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions to or from these entities.
Basis of Presentation: 
 
Prior to January 1, 2001, the Company's equity interests in partially-owned entities also included investments in preferred stock affiliates (corporations in which the Company owned all of the preferred stock and none of the common equity).  Ownership of the preferred stock entitled the Company to substantially all of the economic benefits in the preferred stock affiliates.  On January 1, 2001, the Company acquired the common stock of the preferred stock affiliates, which was owned by the Officers and Trustees of the Company, and converted them to taxable REIT subsidiaries.  Accordingly, the Hotel portion of the Hotel Pennsylvania and the management companies (which provide services to the Company's business segments and operate the Trade Show business of the Merchandise Mart division) have been consolidated beginning January 1, 2001.
 
Management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
  Certain prior year balances have been reclassified in order to conform to current year presentation.
Reclassifications:
 
Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.  Betterments, major renewals and certain costs directly related to the acquisition, improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.  For redevelopment of existing operating properties, the net book value of the existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for the construction and improvements incurred in connection with the redevelopment are capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the property do not exceed the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property when complete.  If the cost of the redeveloped property, including the undepreciated net book value of the property carried forward, exceeds the estimated fair value of redeveloped property, the excess is charged to expense.  Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the assets' estimated useful lives which range from 7 to 40 years.  Tenant allowances are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which approximates the useful lives of the assets.  Additions to real estate include interest expense capitalized during construction of $6,677,000, $12,171,000, and $12,269,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000.
Real Estate: 
Upon acquisitions of real estate, the Company assesses the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, acquired above and below market leases and the origination cost of acquired in-place leases in accordance with SFAS No. 141) and acquired liabilities, and allocate purchase price based on these assessments.  The Company assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property.  The Company's properties are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.  If the Company incorrectly estimates the values at acquisition or the undiscounted cash flows, initial allocations of purchase price and future impairment charges may be different.
 
  Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents does not include cash escrowed under loan agreements and cash restricted in connection with an officer's deferred compensation payable.
Cash and Cash Equivalents:
 
The Company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreements.  The Company also maintains an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents.  This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements.  Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates.
Allowance for doubtful accounts: 
 
  The Company has classified debt and equity securities which it intends to hold for an indefinite period of time (including warrants to acquire equity securities) as securities available for sale; equity securities it intends to buy and sell on a short term basis as trading securities; and preferred stock investments as securities held to maturity.  Unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings.  Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are included as a component of shareholders' equity and other comprehensive income.  Realized gains or losses on the sale of securities are recorded based on specific identification.  A portion of the Company's preferred stock investments are redeemable and accounted for in accordance with EITF 99-20 "Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets."  Income is recognized by applying the prospective method of adjusting the yield to maturity based on an estimate of future cash flows.  If the value of the investment based on the present value of the future cash flows is less than the Company's carrying amount, the investments will be written-down to fair value through earnings.  Investments in securities of non-publicly traded companies are reported at cost, as they are not considered marketable under SFAS No. 115.
Marketable Securities:
 
At December 31, 2002 and 2001, marketable securities had an aggregate cost of $41,665,000 and $117,284,000 and an aggregate market value of $42,525,000 and $126,774,000 (of which $0 and $13,888,000 represents trading securities; $2,020,000 and $49,763,000 represents securities available for sale; and $40,505,000 and $63,123,000 represent securities held to maturity).  Gross unrealized gains and losses were $860,000 and $0 at December 31, 2002, and $14,738,000 and $5,243,000 at December 31, 2001.
 
The Company's policy is to record mortgages and notes receivable at the stated principal amount less any discount or premiums.  The Company accretes or amortizes any discounts or premiums over the life of the related loan receivable utilizing the effective interest method.  The Company evaluates the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of its loans, if circumstances warrant, to determine whether it is impaired. A loan is considered to be impaired, when based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is considered to be impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loan's effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  Interest on impaired loans is recognized on a cash basis.
Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable:
 
Direct financing costs are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related agreements as a component of interest expense. Direct costs related to leasing activities are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases. All other deferred charges are amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method, in accordance with the terms of the agreements to which they relate.
Deferred Charges:
All financial instruments of the Company are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at amounts which, in management's estimation, based upon an interpretation of available market information and valuation methodologies (including discounted cash flow analyses with regard to fixed rate debt) are considered appropriate.  The fair value of the Company's debt is approximately $178,566,000 in excess of the aggregate carrying amount at December 31, 2002.  Such fair value estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized upon disposition of the Company's financial instruments.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, (SFAS 133), as amended and interpreted, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities.  As required by SFAS 133, the Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.  The cumulative effect of implementing SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, was $4,110,000.
Derivative Instruments And Hedging Activities: 
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities
 
For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings.  The Company assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction. For derivatives not designated as hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.  Additionally, the Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently does not have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges.
 
On June 27, 2002, the Company entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the interest rate on the $500,000,000 senior unsecured notes due 2007 from a fixed rate of 5.625% to a floating rate of LIBOR plus .7725%, based upon the trailing 3 month LIBOR rate (2.18% at December 31, 2002).  These swaps were designated and effective as fair value hedges, with a fair value of $34,245,000 at December 31, 2002, which is included in Other Assets on the Company's balance sheet.  Accounting for these swaps also requires the Company to recognize changes in the fair value of the debt during each reporting period.  At December 31, 2002, the fair value adjustment of $34,245,000, based on the fair value of the swaps, is included in the balance of the Senior Unsecured Notes.  Because the hedging relationship qualifies for the "short-cut" method, the hedge ineffectiveness on these fair value hedges was recognized during 2002.
 
  The Company has the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:
Revenue Recognition:
 
Base Rents  income arising from tenant leases.  These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and free rent abatements under the leases.
 
Percentage Rents  income arising from retail tenant leases which are contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold.  These rents are recognized in accordance with SAB 101, which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e. sales thresholds have been achieved).
 
Hotel Revenues  income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue.  Income is recognized when rooms are occupied.  Food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered.
 
Trade Show Revenues  income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths.  This revenue is recognized in accordance with the booth rental contracts when the trade shows have occurred.
 
Expense Reimbursement Income  income arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property.  This income is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.  Contingent rents are not recognized until realized.
The Company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.  The Company will distribute to its shareholders 100% of its taxable income and therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. Dividend distributions for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, were characterized for Federal income tax purposes as ordinary income.
Income Taxes:
 
The Company owns stock in corporations that have elected to be treated for Federal income tax purposes, as taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS").  The value of the combined TRS stock cannot and does not exceed 20% of the value of the Company's total assets.  A TRS is taxable on its net income at regular corporate tax rates.  For the 2002 tax year, the total income tax is approximately $1,430,000.
 
The following table reconciles net income to estimated taxable income for the year ended December 31, 2002.
 
 
The net basis of the Company's assets and liabilities for tax purposes is approximately $2,822,000,000 lower than the amount reported for financial statement purposes.
 
At December 31, 2002, the Company had a capital loss carryover of approximately $73,000,000.  The capital loss carryover is available to offset future capital gains that would otherwise be required to be distributed as dividends to shareholders.
 
  Basic earnings per share is computed based on weighted average shares outstanding.  Diluted earnings per share considers the effect of outstanding options, warrants and convertible or redeemable securities.
Amounts Per Share:
 
  In 2002 and prior years, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method. Under the intrinsic value method compensation cost is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the Company's stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the option granted. Compensation cost for stock options, if any, is recognized ratably over the vesting period.  The Company's policy is to grant options with an exercise price equal to the quoted market price of the Company's stock on the grant date. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the Company's stock option plans.  See Note 9 - Employees' Share Option Plan for details of the Company's outstanding employee share options and the related pro forma stock-based employee compensation cost. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" as amended by SFAS No. 148 "Accounting for Stock - Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure."  The Company will adopt SFAS No. 123 prospectively by valuing and accounting for employee stock options granted in 2003 and thereafter.  The Company will utilize a binomial valuation model and appropriate market assumptions to determine the value of each grant.  Stock-based compensation expense will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the respective grants.
Stock Based Compensation:
 
In addition to employee stock option grants, the Company has also granted restricted shares to certain of its employees that vest over a three to five year period.  The Company records the value of each restricted share award as stock-based compensation expense based on the Company's closing stock price on the NYSE on the date of grant on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  As of December 31, 2002, the Company has 250,927 restricted shares or rights to receive restricted shares outstanding to employees of the Company, excluding 626,566 shares issued to the Company's President in connection with his employment agreement.  The Company recognized $1,868,000 of stock-based compensation expense in 2002 for the portion of these shares that vested during the year.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
 
SFAS No. 141 - requires companies to account for the value of leases acquired and the costs of acquiring such leases separately from the value of the real estate for all acquisitions subsequent to July 1, 2001.  Accordingly, the Company has evaluated the leases in place for (i) the remaining 66% of CESCR it did not previously own which it acquired on January 1, 2002, (ii) the remaining 50% of the Las Catalinas Mall it did not previously own which it acquired on September 23, 2002 and (iii) a 50% interest in the Monmouth Mall which it acquired on October 10, 2002, to determine whether they were acquired at market, above market or below market.  The Company's evaluations were based on (i) the differences between contractual rentals and the estimated market rents over the applicable lease term discounted back to the date of acquisition utilizing a discount rate adjusted for the credit risk associated with the respective tenants and (ii) the estimated cost of acquiring such leases giving effect to the Company's history of providing tenant improvements and paying leasing commissions.
Business Combinations
 
As a result of its evaluations, as of December 31, 2002, the Company has recorded a deferred credit of $48,430,000 representing the value of acquired below market leases, deferred charges of $15,976,000 for the value of acquired above market leases and $3,621,000 for origination costs.  In addition, in the year ended December 31, 2002 the Company has recognized property rentals of $12,634,000, for the amortization of below market leases net of above market leases, and depreciation expense of $1,214,000 for the amortization of the lease origination costs and additional building depreciation resulting from the reallocation of the purchase price of the applicable properties.
 
SFAS No. 142  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 142, (effective January 1, 2002).  SFAS No. 142 specifies that goodwill and some intangible assets will no longer be amortized but instead be subject to periodic impairment testing.  SFAS No. 142 provides specific guidance for impairment testing of these assets and removes them from the scope of SFAS No. 121, .  The Company's goodwill balance on December 31, 2001 of $30,129,000 consisted of $14,639,000 related to the Hotel Pennsylvania acquisition and $15,490,000 related to the acquisition of the Temperature Controlled Logistics businesses.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
 
Prior to January 1, 2002, the Company performed impairment testing in accordance with SFAS 121.  The Company reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Given the decrease in the estimated market values and the deteriorating performance of Hotel Pennsylvania and Temperature Controlled Logistics, the Company performed a review for recoverability estimating the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition.  As of December 31, 2001, the sum of the expected cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) exceeded the carrying amounts of goodwill, and therefore no impairments were recognized.
 
Upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002, the Company tested the goodwill for impairment at the reporting level unit utilizing the prescribed two-step method.  The first step compared the fair value of the reporting unit (determined based on a discounted cash flow approach) with its carrying amount.  As the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value, the second step of the impairment test was performed to measure the impairment loss.  The second step compared the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill.  As the carrying amounts of the goodwill exceed the fair values, on January 1, 2002 the Company wrote-off all of the goodwill of the Hotel and the Temperature Controlled Logistics businesses as an impairment loss totaling $30,129,000.  The write-off has been reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on the income statement.  Earnings allocable to the minority interest have been reduced by their pro-rata share of the write-off of goodwill.
 
Previously reported "Income before gains on sale of real estate, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle" and "Net income applicable to common shares" for the year ended December 31, 2001 would have been approximately $972,000 higher, or $2.35 and $2.48 per share, if such goodwill was not amortized in the prior year.
SFAS No. 143  Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations and SFAS No. 144  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
 
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, (effective January 1, 2003) and SFAS No. 144, (effective January 1, 2002).  SFAS No. 143 requires the recording of the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period which it is incurred.  SFAS No. 144 supersedes current accounting literature and now provides for a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale and requires discontinued operations presentation for disposals of a "component" of an entity.  In accordance with SFAS No. 144, for all periods presented, the Company reclassified its consolidated statements of operations to reflect income and expenses for properties which are held for sale as discontinued operations and reclassified its consolidated balance sheets to reflect assets and liabilities related to such properties as assets related to discontinued operations and liabilities related to discontinued operations.

SFAS No. 145  Rescission of SFAS No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of SFAS No. 13, and Technical Corrections
 
In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, SFAS No. 145 requires, among other things, (i) that the modification of a lease that results in a change of the classification of the lease from capital to operating under the provisions of SFAS No. 13 be accounted for as a sale-leaseback transaction and (ii) the reporting of gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt as extraordinary items only if they met the criteria of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30,   The rescission of SFAS No. 4 is effective January 1, 2003.  The amendment of SFAS No. 13 is effective for transactions occurring on or after May 15, 2002. The adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

SFAS No. 146  Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
 
In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, (effective January 1, 2003).  SFAS No. 146 replaces current accounting literature and requires the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan.  The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

SFAS No. 148  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure  An Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123
 
On August 7, 2002, the Company announced that beginning January 1, 2003, it will expense the cost of employee stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123,   In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 148    to amend the transition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123.  Specifically, SFAS No. 123, as amended, would permit two additional transition methods for entities that adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation.  The Company will adopt SFAS No. 123 prospectively by valuing and accounting for employee stock options granted in 2003 and thereafter.  The Company will utilize a binomial valuation model and appropriate market assumptions to determine the value of each grant.  Stock-based compensation expense will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the respective grants.

FASB Interpretation No. 45  Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others
 
In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45  , which elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued.  The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this Interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002.  The Company believes that the adoption of this interpretation will not have a material effect to the financial statements.

FASB Interpretation No. 46  Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
 
In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46  which requires the consolidation of an entity by an enterprise (i) if that enterprise, known as a "primary beneficiary", has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity's expected losses if they occur, receive a majority of the entity's expected residual returns if they occur, or both and (ii) if the entity is a variable interest entity, as defined by Interpretation No. 46.  An entity is a variable interest entity if (a) the total equity investment at risk in the entity is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or (b) the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest in the entity.  Interpretation No. 46 applies immediately to all variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003.  For variable interest entities created by public companies before February 1, 2003, Interpretation No. 46 must be applied no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003.  The initial determination of whether an entity is a variable interest entity shall be made as of the date at which a primary beneficiary becomes involved with the entity and reconsidered as of the date one of three triggering events described by Interpretation No. 46 occur.  The Company does not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material effect on its financial statements.

Acquisitions and Dispositions
             
 
The Company completed approximately $1,834,600,000 of real estate acquisitions or investments in 2002 and $19,200,000 in 2001.  These acquisitions were consummated through subsidiaries or preferred stock affiliates of the Company.  Acquisitions of business were recorded under the purchase method of accounting. Related net assets and results of operations have been included in these financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition.  The pro forma effect of the individual acquisitions and in the aggregate other than Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty, were not material to the Company's historical results of operations.
 
Acquisitions of individual properties are recorded as acquisitions of real estate assets.  Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The purchase price for property acquisitions and businesses acquired is allocated to acquired assets and assumed liabilities using their relative fair values as of the acquisition date based on valuations and other studies. Initial valuations are subject to change until such information is finalized no later than 12 months from the acquisition date.
 
Office:
 
Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty Investment ("CESCR")
 
On January 1, 2002, the Company completed the combination of CESCR with Vornado.  CESCR has a dominant market position in the Washington, D.C. and Northern Virginia area, owning approximately 12.4 million square feet in 53 office properties as well as a highly competent management team.  In the Company's opinion, the assets were acquired at below replacement cost and with below market leases.  As a result of the combination, the Company will be in position to capitalize on the favorable supply/demand characteristics of the Washington, D.C office markets.  Prior to the combination, Vornado owned a 34% interest in CESCR.  The consideration for the remaining 66% of CESCR was approximately $1,600,000,000, consisting of 15.6 million newly issued Vornado Operating Partnership units and approximately $1 billion of debt (66% of CESCR's total debt).  The purchase price paid by the Company was determined based on the weighted average closing price of the equity issued to CESCR unitholders for the period beginning two business days before and ending two business days after the date the acquisition was agreed to and announced on October 19, 2001.  The Company also capitalized as part of the basis of the assets acquired approximately $32,000,000 for third party acquisition related costs, including advisory, legal and other professional fees that were contemplated at the time of the acquisition.  The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at January 1, 2002, the date of acquisition.
 
(Amounts in thousands)
 
 
The Company's estimate of the weighted average useful life of acquired intangibles is approximately three years.  This acquisition was recorded as a business combination under the purchase method of accounting.  The purchase price was allocated to acquired assets and assumed liabilities using their relative fair values as of January 1, 2002 based on valuations and other studies.  The operations of CESCR are consolidated into the accounts of the Company beginning January 1, 2002.  Prior to this date the Company accounted for its 34% interest on the equity method.
The unaudited pro forma information set forth below presents the condensed consolidated statements of income for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2001 as if the following transactions had occurred on January 1, 2001, (i) the acquisition of CESCR described above and (ii) the Company's November 21, 2001 sale of 9,775,000 common shares and the use of proceeds to repay indebtedness.

Retail:
Las Catalinas Mall
On September 23, 2002, the Company increased its interest in the Las Catalinas Mall located in Caguas, Puerto Rico (San Juan area) to 100% by acquiring the 50% of the mall and 25% of the Kmart anchor store it did not already own. The purchase price was $48,000,000, of which $16,000,000 was paid in cash and $32,000,000 was debt assumed.  The Las Catalinas Mall, which opened in 1997, contains 492,000 square feet, including a 123,000 square foot Kmart and a 138,000 square foot Sears owned by the tenant.  Prior to September 23, 2002, the Company accounted for its investment on the equity method.  Subsequent to this date the operations of Las Catalinas are consolidated into the accounts of the Company.
 
Monmouth Mall
On October 10, 2002, a joint venture in which the Company has a 50% interest, acquired the Monmouth Mall, an enclosed super regional shopping center located in Eatontown, New Jersey containing approximately 1.5 million square feet, including four department stores, three of which aggregating 731,000 square feet are owned by the tenants.  The purchase price was approximately $164,700,000, including transaction costs of $4,400,000.  The Company made a $7,000,000 cash investment in the form of common equity to the venture and provided it with cash of $23,500,000 representing preferred equity yielding 14%.  The venture financed the purchase of the Mall with $135,000,000 of floating rate debt at LIBOR plus 2.05%, with a LIBOR floor of 2.50% on $35,000,000, a three year term and two one-year extension options.  The Company accounts for its investment on the equity method.
Other:
 
On December 31, 2002, the Company and Crescent Real Estate Equities formed a joint venture to acquire the Carthage, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas quarries from AmeriCold Logistics, the Company's tenant at the cold storage warehouses (Temperature Controlled Logistics) facilities for $20,000,000 in cash (appraised value).  The Company contributed cash of $8,800,000 to the joint venture representing its 44% interest.  The Company accounts for its investment in the venture on the equity method.
 
Dispositions:
 
The following table sets forth the details of sales, dispositions, write-offs and other similar transactions for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000:
 
 
Gain on Transfer of Mortgages
 
In the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded a net gain of approximately $2.1 million resulting from payments to the Company by third parties that assumed certain of the Company's mortgages.  Under these transactions the Company paid to the third parties that assumed the Company's obligations the outstanding amounts due under the mortgages and the third parties paid the Company for the benefit of assuming the mortgages.  The Company has been released by the creditors underlying these loans.
 
Net Gain on Sale of Air Rights
 
The Company constructed a $16.3 million community facility and low-income residential housing development (the "30th Street Venture"), in order to receive 163,728 square feet of transferable development rights, generally referred to as "air rights".  The Company donated the building to a charitable organization.  The Company sold 106,796 square feet of these air rights to third parties at an average price of $120 per square foot.  An additional 28,821 square feet of air rights was sold to Alexander's at a price of $120 per square foot for use at Alexander's 59th Street development project (the "59th Street Project").  In each case, the Company received cash in exchange for air rights.  The Company identified third party buyers for the remaining 28,111 square feet of air rights of the 30th Street Venture.  These third party buyers wanted to use the air rights for the development of two projects located in the general area of 86th Street which was not within the required geographical radius of the construction site nor in the same Community Board as the low-income housing and community facility project.  The 30th Street Venture asked Alexander's to sell 28,111 square feet of the air rights it already owned to the third party buyers (who could use them) and the 30th Street Venture would replace them with 28,111 square feet of air rights.  In October 2002, the Company sold 28,111 square feet of air rights to Alexander's for an aggregate sales price of $3,059,000 (an average of $109 per square foot).   Alexander's then sold an equal amount of air rights to the third party buyers for an aggregate sales price of $3,339,000 (an average of $119 per square foot).
Gain on Sale of Kinzie Park Condominium Units
 
The Company recognized a gain of $2,156,000 during 2002, from the sale of residential condos in Chicago, Illinois.
 
Primestone Foreclosure and Impairment Losses
 
On September 28, 2000, the Company made a $62,000,000 loan to Primestone Investment Partners, L.P. ("Primestone").  The Company received a 1% up-front fee and was entitled to receive certain other fees aggregating approximately 3% upon repayment of the loan.  The loan bore interest at 16% per annum.  Primestone defaulted on the repayment of this loan on October 25, 2001.  The loan was subordinate to $37,957,000 of other debt of the borrower that liened the Company's collateral.  On October 31, 2001, the Company purchased the other debt for its face amount.  The loans were secured by 7,944,893 partnership units in Prime Group Realty, L.P., the operating partnership of Prime Group Realty Trust (NYSE:PGE) and the partnership units are exchangeable for the same number of common shares of PGE.  The loans are also guaranteed by affiliates of Primestone.
 
On November 19, 2001, the Company sold, pursuant to a participation agreement with a subsidiary of Cadim inc., a Canadian pension fund, a 50% participation in both loans at par for approximately $50,000,000 reducing the Company's net investment in the loans at December 31, 2001 to $56,768,000 including unpaid interest and fees of $6,790,000.  The participation did not meet the criteria for "sale accounting" under SFAS 140 because Cadim was not free to pledge or exchange the assets.  Accordingly, the Company was required to account for this transaction as a borrowing secured by the loan, rather than as a sale of the loan by classifying the participation as an "Other Liability" and continuing to report the outstanding loan balance at 100% in "Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable" on the balance sheet.  Under the terms of the participation agreement, cash payments received shall be applied (i) first, to the reimbursement of reimbursable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the servicing, administration or enforcement of the loans after November 19, 2001, and then to interest and fees owed to the Company through November 19, 2001, (ii) second, to the Company and Cadim, pro rata in proportion to the amount of interest and fees owed following November 19, 2001 and (iii) third, 50% to the Company and 50% to Cadim as recovery of principal.
 
On April 30, 2002, the Company and Cadim acquired the 7,944,893 partnership units at a foreclosure auction.   The price paid for the units by application of a portion of Primestone's indebtedness to the Company and Cadim was $8.35 per unit, the April 30, 2002 closing price of shares of PGE on the New York Stock Exchange.  On June 28, 2002, pursuant to the terms of the participation agreement, the Company transferred 3,972,447 of the partnership units to Cadim.
 
In the second quarter, in accordance with foreclosure accounting, the Company recorded a loss on the Primestone foreclosure of $17,671,000 calculated based on (i) the acquisition price of the units and (ii) its valuation of the amounts realizable under the guarantees by affiliates of Primestone, as compared with the net carrying amount of the investment at April 30, 2002.  In the third quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a $2,229,000 write-down on its investment based on costs expended to realize the value of the guarantees.  Further, in the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a $15,857,000 write-down of its investment in Prime Group consisting of  (i) $14,857,000 to adjust the carrying amount of the Prime Group units to $4.61 per unit, the closing price of PGE shares on December 31, 2002 on the New York Stock Exchange and (ii) $1,000,000 for estimated costs to realize the value of the guarantees.  The Company considered the decline in the value of the units which are convertible into stock to be other than temporary as of December 31, 2002, based on the fact that the market value of the units which are convertible into stock has been less than its cost for more than six months, the severity of the decline, market trends, the financial condition and near-term prospects of Prime Group and other relevant factors.
 
At December 31, 2002, the Company's carrying amount of the investment was $23,408,000, of which $18,313,000 represents the carrying amount of the 3,972,447 partnership units owned by the Company ($4.61 per unit), $6,100,000 represents the amount expected to be realized under the guarantees, offset by $1,005,000 representing the Company's share of Prime Group Realty's net loss through September 30, 2002 (see Note 5. Investments in and Advances to Partially-Owned Entities).  Prior to April 30, 2002, this investment was in the form of a loan and was included in Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable on the balance sheet.
 
At February 3, 2003, the closing price of PGE shares on the New York Stock Exchange was $5.30 per share.  The ultimate realization of the Company's investment will depend upon the future performance of the Chicago real estate market and the performance of PGE, as well as the ultimate realizable value of the net assets supporting the guarantees and the Company's ability to collect under the guarantees.  In addition, the Company will continue to monitor this investment to determine whether additional write-downs are required based on (i) declines in value of the shares of PGE (for which the partnership units are exchangeable) which are "other than temporary" as used in accounting literature and (ii) the amount expected to be realized under the guarantees.
Write-off Investments in Technology Companies
In the first quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $4,723,000 resulting from the write-off of an equity investment in a technology company.  In the second quarter of 2001, the Company recorded an additional charge of $13,561,000 resulting from the write-off of all of its remaining equity investments in technology companies due to both the deterioration of the financial condition of these companies and the lack of acceptance by the market of certain of their products and services.  In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded $1,481,000 of income resulting from the reversal of a deferred liability relating to the termination of an agreement permitting one of the technology companies access to its properties.
 
Park Laurel Condominium Project
In the third quarter of 2001, the Park Laurel joint venture (69% interest owned by the Company) completed the sale of 52 condominium units of the total 53 units and received proceeds of $139,548,000.  The Company's share of the after tax net gain was $15,657,000.  The Company's share of the after-tax net gain reflects $3,953,000 (net of tax benefit of $1,826,000) awards accrued under the venture's incentive compensation plan.
 
Write-off of Net Investment in RTR
In the third quarter of 2001, the Company wrote-off its entire net investment of $7,374,000 in RTR based on the operating losses and an assessment of the value of the real estate.

In September 1998, Atlantic City condemned the Company's property.  In the third quarter of 1998, the Company recorded a gain of $1,694,000, which reflected the condemnation award of $3,100,000, net of the carrying value of the property of $1,406,000.  The Company appealed the amount and on June 27, 2001, was awarded an additional $3,050,000, which has been recorded as a gain in the quarter ended June 30, 2001.
 
On May 17, 2001, the Company sold its 50% interest in 570 Lexington Avenue for $60,000,000, resulting in a gain of $12,445,000.

SFAS No. 144 supersedes current accounting literature and now provides for a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale and requires discontinued operations presentation for disposals of a "component" of an entity.  In accordance with SFAS No. 144, for all periods presented, the Company reclassified its consolidated statements of operations to reflect income and expenses for properties which are held for sale as discontinued operations and reclassified its consolidated balance sheets to reflect assets and liabilities related to such properties as assets related to discontinued operations and liabilities related to discontinued operations.
 
Assets related to discontinued operations at December 31, 2002 and 2001 includes approximately $123,076,000 for the Company's New York City office property located at Two Park Avenue (principally real estate) and retail properties located in Vineland, New Jersey, Baltimore, Maryland and Hagerstown, Maryland.  The following is a summary of the combined results of operations of these properties:
 
 
The consolidated financial statements have been revised to reflect the reclassification of these properties for all periods presented.

Alexander's
 
Ownership
 
The Company owns 1,655,000 common shares or 33.1% of the outstanding common stock of Alexander's at December 31, 2002.  Alexander's is managed by and its properties are leased and developed by the Company pursuant to management, leasing and development agreements with one-year terms expiring in March of each year, which are automatically renewable.  In conjunction with the closing of the Alexander's Lexington Avenue construction loan on July 3, 2002, these agreements were revised to cover the Alexander's Lexington Avenue property separately.  Further, the Lexington Avenue management and development agreements were amended to provide for a term lasting until substantial completion of the development of the property, with automatic renewals, and for the payment of the development fee upon the earlier of January 3, 2006, or the payment in full of the construction loan encumbering the property.  The Company is entitled to a development fee estimated to be approximately $26,300,000, based on 6% of construction costs, as defined, of which $7,667,000 has been recognized as income during the year ended December 31, 2002.
 
Debt
At December 31, 2002, the Company had loans receivable from Alexander's of $119,000,000, including $24,000,000 drawn under the $50,000,000 line of credit the Company granted to Alexander's on August 1, 2000.  The maturity date of the loan and the line of credit is the earlier of January 3, 2006 or the date the Alexander's Lexington Avenue construction loan is repaid.  The interest rate on the loan and line of credit, which resets quarterly using the same spread to treasuries as presently exists with a 3% floor for treasuries, is 12.48% at December 31, 2002.  The Company believes that although Alexander's has disclosed that it does not have positive cash flow sufficient to repay this loan to the Company currently, Alexander's will be able to repay the loan upon the successful development and permanent financing of its Lexington Avenue development project or through asset sales.
 
On July 3, 2002, Alexander's finalized a $490,000,000 loan with HVB Real Estate Capital (HYPO Vereinsbank) to finance the construction of its approximately 1.3 million square foot multi-use building at its 59th Street and Lexington Avenue location.  The estimated construction costs in excess of the construction loan of approximately $140,000,000 will be provided by Alexander's.  The loan has an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.5% and a term of forty-two months plus two one-year extensions.  Alexander's has received an initial funding of $55,500,000 under the loan of which $25,000,000 was used to repay existing loans and notes payable.  Pursuant to this loan, Vornado has agreed to guarantee, among other things, the lien free, timely completion of the construction of the project and funding of project costs in excess of a stated budget, as defined in the loan agreement, if not funded by Alexander's  (the "Completion Guarantee").  The $6,300,000 estimated fee payable by Alexander's to the Company for the Completion Guarantee is 1% of construction costs (as defined) and is payable at the same time that the development fee is payable.  In addition, if the Company should advance any funds under the Completion Guarantee in excess of the $26,000,000 currently available under the secured line of credit, interest on those advances is at 15% per annum.
 
Agreements with Alexander's
 
Alexander's is managed by and its properties are leased by the Company, pursuant to agreements with a one-year term expiring in March of each year which are automatically renewable. The annual management fee payable to the Company by Alexander's is equal to the sum of (i) $3,000,000, (ii) 3% of the gross income from the Kings Plaza Mall, and (iii) 6% of development costs with minimum guaranteed fees of $750,000 per annum.
 
The leasing agreement provides for the Company to generally receive a fee of (i) 3% of sales proceeds and (ii) 3% of lease rent for the first ten years of a lease term, 2% of lease rent for the eleventh through the twentieth years of a lease term and 1% of lease rent for the twenty-first through thirtieth year of a lease term, subject to the payment of rents by Alexander's tenants.  Such amount is receivable annually in an amount not to exceed $2,500,000 until the present value of such installments (calculated at a discount rate of 9% per annum) equals the amount that would have been paid at the time the transactions which gave rise to the commissions occurred.  At December 31, 2002, $410,000 is due to the Company under this agreement.
Alexander's
 
Other
 
The Company constructed a $16.3 million community facility and low-income residential housing development (the "30th Street Venture"), in order to receive 163,728 square feet of transferable development rights, generally referred to as "air rights".  The Company donated the building to a charitable organization.  The Company sold 106,796 square feet of these air rights to third parties at an average price of $120 per square foot.  An additional 28,821 square feet of air rights was sold to Alexander's at a price of $120 per square foot for use at Alexander's 59th Street development project (the "59th Street Project").  In each case, the Company received cash in exchange for air rights.  The Company identified third party buyers for the remaining 28,111 square feet of air rights related to the 30th Street Venture.  These third party buyers wanted to use the air rights for the development of two projects located in the general area of 86th Street which was not within the required geographical radius of the construction site nor in the same Community Board as the low-income housing and community facility project.  The 30th Street Venture asked Alexander's to sell 28,111 square feet of the air rights it already owned to the third party buyers (who could use them) and the 30th Street Venture would replace them with 28,111 square feet of air rights.  In October 2002, the Company sold 28,111 square feet of air rights to Alexander's for an aggregate sales price of $3,059,000 (an average of $109 per square foot).   Alexander's then sold an equal amount of air rights to the third party buyers for an aggregate sales price of $3,339,000 (an average of $119 per square foot).
 
On October 5, 2001, Alexander's entered into a ground lease for its Paramus, N.J. property with IKEA Property, Inc.  The lease has a 40-year term with an option to purchase at the end of the 20th year for $75,000,000.  Further, Alexander's has obtained a $68,000,000 interest only, non-recourse mortgage loan on the property from a third party lender.  The interest rate on the debt is 5.92% with interest payable monthly until maturity in October 2011.  The triple net rent each year is the sum of $700,000 plus the amount of debt service on the mortgage loan.  If the purchase option is not exercised at the end of the 20th year, the triple net rent for the last 20 years must include debt service sufficient to fully amortize the $68,000,000 over the remaining 20 year lease period.
 
On May 1, 2001 Alexander's entered into a lease agreement with Bloomberg L.P., for approximately 695,000 square feet of office space.  The initial term of the lease is for 25 years, with one ten-year renewal option.  Base annual net rent is $34,529,000 in each of the first four years and $38,533,000 in the fifth year with similar percentage increases each four years.  There can be no assurance that this project ultimately will be completed, completed on time or completed for the budgeted amount.  If the project is not completed on a timely basis, the lease may be cancelled and significant penalties may apply.
 
On August 30, 2002, Alexander's sold its Third Avenue property, located in the Bronx, New York, which resulted in a gain of $10,366,000.  On January 12, 2001, Alexander's sold its Fordham Road property located in the Bronx, New York, for $25,500,000, which resulted in a gain of $19,026,000.  In addition, Alexander's paid off the mortgage on its Fordham Road property at a discount, which resulted in a gain from early extinguishment of debt of $3,534,000 in the first quarter of 2001.

Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable
                                     
 
Loan to Commonwealth Atlantic Properties ("CAPI")
 
On March 4, 1999 the Company made an additional $242,000,000 investment in Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P. ("CESCR") by contributing to CESCR the land under certain CESCR office properties in Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia and partnership interests in certain CESCR subsidiaries.  The Company acquired these assets from Commonwealth Atlantic Properties, Inc.  ("CAPI"), an affiliate of Lazard Freres Real Estate Investors L.L.C., for $242,000,000, immediately prior to the contribution to CESCR. In addition, the Company acquired from CAPI for $8 million the land under a Marriott Hotel located in Crystal City.  The Company paid the $250,000,000 purchase price to CAPI by issuing 4,998,000 of the Company's Series E-1 convertible preferred units.  In connection with these transactions, the Company agreed to make a five-year $41,200,000 loan to CAPI with interest at 8%, increasing to 9% ratably over the term.  The loan is secured by approximately 1.1 million of the Company's Series E-1 convertible preferred units issued to CAPI.  Each Series E-1 convertible preferred unit is convertible into 1.1364 of the Company's common shares.  The total value of these units, on an as-converted basis, was $46,500,000 based on a closing price of $37.20 per common share on December 31, 2002.
 
Loan to Vornado Operating Company ("Vornado Operating")
 
At December 31, 2002, the amount outstanding under the revolving credit agreement with Vornado Operating was $21,989,000.  Vornado Operating has disclosed that in the aggregate its investments do not, and for the foreseeable future are not expected to, generate sufficient cash flow to pay all of its debts and expenses.  Further, Vornado Operating states that its only investee, AmeriCold Logistics ("Tenant"), anticipates that its Landlord, a partnership 60% owned by the Company and 40% owned by Crescent Real Estate Equities, will need to restructure the leases between the Landlord and the Tenant to provide additional cash flow to the Tenant (the Landlord has previously restructured the leases to provide additional cash flow to the Tenant).  Management anticipates a further lease restructuring and the sale and/or financing of assets by AmeriCold Logistics, and accordingly, Vornado Operating is expected to have a source to repay the debt under this facility, which may be extended.  Since January 1, 2002, the Company has not recognized interest income on the debt under this facility.  The Company has assessed the collectibility of this loan as of December 31, 2002 and determined that it is not impaired.
 
Dearborn Center Mezzanine Construction Loan
 
As of December 31, 2002, $60,758,000 is outstanding under the Dearborn Center Mezzanine Construction Loan to a special purpose entity, of which $23,392,000 has been funded by the Company, representing a 38.5% interest.  The special purpose entity's sole asset is Dearborn Center, a 1.5 million square foot high-rise office tower under construction in Chicago.  The entity is owned by Prime Group Realty L.P. and another investor.  The Company is a member of a loan syndicate led by a money center bank.  The proceeds of the loan are being used to finance the construction, and are subordinate to a $225,000,000 first mortgage.  The loan is due January 21, 2004, three years from the date of the initial draw, and provides for a 1-year extension at the borrower's option (assuming net operating income at a specified level and a cash reserve sufficient to fund interest for the extension period).  The loan bears interest at 12% per annum plus additional interest upon repayment ranging from a minimum of 9.5% to 11.5%.

Debt
                                     
Following is a summary of the Company's debt:
 
(Amounts in thousands)
 
 
On January 11, 2001, the Company completed a $105,000 refinancing of its 888 Seventh Avenue office building.  The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.63% and matures on February 1, 2006.  A portion of the proceeds received was used to repay the then existing mortgage of $55,000.
(1)
         
On January 1, 2002, the Company acquired the remaining 66% of CESCR it did not previously own.  Prior to January 1, 2002, the Company's share of CESCR's debt was included in Investments in and Advances to Partially-Owned Entities.  In connection with the acquisition, CESCR's fixed rate debt of $1,282,780 was fair valued at $1,317,428 under purchase accounting.
(2)
         
On September 23, 2002, the Company acquired the 50% of the Mall and the 25% of Kmart's anchor store it did not already own.  Prior to this date, the Company accounted for its investment on the equity method and the Company's share of the debt was included in Investments in and Advances to Partially-Owned Entities.
(3)
         
On July 11, 2001, the Company completed a $50,000 refinancing of its Market Square Complex.  The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.95% per annum and matures in July 2011.  The proceeds received were used to repay the then existing mortgage of $49,000.
(4)
         
On October 16, 2001, the Company completed a $49,000 refinancing of its Washington Design Center property.  The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.95% and matures on October 16, 2011.   A portion of the proceeds received was used to repay the then existing mortgage of $23,000.
(5)
         
On September 20, 2001, the Company completed a $50,000 mortgage financing, cross collateralized by its eight industrial warehouse properties.  The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.95% per annum and matures on October 1, 2011.
(6)
         
On June 21, 2002, one of the lenders purchased the other participant's interest in the loan.  At the same time, the loan was extended for one year, with certain modifications including, (i) making the risk of a loss due to terrorism (as defined) not covered by insurance recourse to the Company and (ii) the granting of two 1-year renewal options to the Company.
(7)
         
On April 1, 2002, the Company increased its mortgage financing cross collateralized by its 770 Broadway/595 Madison Avenue properties by $115,000.  On July 15, 2002, the Company repaid $84,841 with proceeds received from a third party which resulted in a gain on transfer of mortgages of $2,096.  The proceeds of the loan are in a restricted mortgage escrow account which bears interest at the same rate as the loan, and at December 31, 2002 totals $153,659.
(8)
         
On June 24, 2002, the Company completed an offering of $500,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2007.  Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on June 15th and December 15th, commencing December 15, 2002.  The notes were priced at 99.856% of their face amount to yield 5.659%.  The net proceeds of approximately $496,300 were used to repay the mortgage payable on 350 North Orleans, Two Park Avenue, the Merchandise Mart and Seven Skyline.  On June 27, 2002, the Company entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the interest rate on the $500,000 senior unsecured notes due 2007 from a fixed rate of 5.625% to a floating rate of LIBOR plus .7725%, based upon the trailing 3 month LIBOR rate (2.15% if set on December 31, 2002).  As a result of the hedge accounting for the interest rate swap on the Company's senior unsecured debt, the Company recorded a fair value adjustment of $34,245, as of December 31, 2002 which is equal to the fair value of the interest rate swap asset.
(9)
         
The net carrying amount of properties collateralizing the notes and mortgages amounted to $4,938,012,000 at December 31, 2002.  As at December 31, 2002, the principal repayments for the next five years and thereafter are as follows:

Includes $153,659 which is offset by an equivalent amount of cash held in a restricted mortgage escrow account.
(1)
   
 
The Company's debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by its properties (which are generally non-recourse to the Company), its revolving credit agreement and its senior unsecured notes due 2007, contain customary covenants requiring the Company to maintain insurance.  There can be no assurance that the lenders under these instruments will not take the position that an exclusion from all risk insurance coverage for losses due to terrorist acts is a breach of these debt instruments that allows the lenders to declare an event of default and accelerate repayment of debt. The Company has received correspondence from four lenders regarding terrorism insurance coverage, to which the Company has responded.  In these letters the lenders took the position that under the agreements governing the loans provided by these lenders the Company was required to maintain terrorism insurance on the properties securing the various loans.  The aggregate amount of borrowings under these loans as of December 31, 2002 was approximately $770.4 million, and there was no additional borrowing capacity.  Subsequently, the Company obtained an aggregate of $360 million of separate coverage for "terrorist acts".  To date, one of the lenders has acknowledged to the Company that it will not raise any further questions based on the Company's terrorism insurance coverage in place, and the other three lenders have not raised any further questions regarding the Company's insurance coverage.  If lenders insist on greater coverage for these risks, it could adversely affect the Company's ability to finance and/or refinance its properties and to expand its portfolio.

Employees' Share Option Plan
 
The Company grants various officers and employees incentive share options and non-qualified options to purchase common shares. Options granted are at prices equal to 100% of the market price of the Company's shares at the date of grant.  Shares vest on a graduated basis, becoming fully vested 36 months after grant. All options expire ten years after grant.
 
The Plan also provides for the award of Stock Appreciation Rights, Performance Shares and Restricted Stock, as defined.  As of December 31, 2002, there were 250,927 restricted shares or rights to receive restricted shares outstanding, excluding 626,566 shares issued to the Company's President in connection with his employment agreement.
 
In 2002 and prior years, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method.  Accordingly, no stock-based compensation was recognized in the Company's financial statements for these years.  If compensation cost for Plan awards had been determined based on fair value at the grant dates, net income and income per share would have been reduced to the pro-forma amounts below, for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000:
 
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using an option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in the periods ending December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000.
 
 
A summary of the Plan's status and changes during the years then ended, is presented below:
 
The following table summarizes information about options outstanding under the Plan at December 31, 2002:
 
 
Shares available for future grant under the Plan at December 31, 2002 were 9,963,500, of which 2,500,000 are subject to shareholder approval.

Retirement Plan
 
In December 1997, benefits under the Company's Retirement Plan were frozen.  Prior to December 31, 1997, the Company's qualified plan covered all full-time employees. The Plan provided annual pension benefits that were equal to 1% of the employee's annual compensation for each year of participation. The funding policy is in accordance with the minimum funding requirements of ERISA.
 
Pension expense includes the following components:
 
 
Not applicable, as benefits under the Plan were frozen in December 1997.

11.
           
Leases
 
As lessor:
The Company leases space to tenants in office buildings and shopping centers under operating leases. Most of the leases provide for the payment of fixed base rentals payable monthly in advance. Shopping center leases provide for the pass-through to tenants of real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance. Office building leases generally require the tenants to reimburse the Company for operating costs and real estate taxes above their base year costs. Shopping center leases also provide for the payment by the lessee of additional rent based on a percentage of the tenants' sales. As of December 31, 2002, future base rental revenue under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding rents for leases with an original term of less than one year and rents resulting from the exercise of renewal options, is as follows:
 
($ in thousands)
 
 
These amounts do not include rentals based on tenants' sales.  These percentage rents approximated $1,832,000, $2,157,000, and $4,825,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000.
 
Former Bradlees Locations
 
The Company previously leased 18 locations to Bradlees which closed all of its stores in February 2001.  The Company has re-leased nine of the former Bradlees locations; three to Kohl's, two each to Lowe's and Haynes Furniture, and one each to Home Depot and Wal-Mart.  Lowe's and Wal-Mart will construct their own stores, subject to the receipt of various governmental approvals and the relocation of existing tenants.  In addition, the leases for four other former Bradlees locations were assigned by Bradlees to other retailers.  Of the remaining five locations which are currently vacant, two of the leases are guaranteed and the rent is being paid by Stop & Shop, a wholly-owned subsidiary of KoninKlijke Ahold NV (formerly Royal Ahold NV), an international food retailer.  Stop & Shop remains contingently liable for rent at a number of the former Bradlees locations for the term of the Bradlees leases.
 
Property rentals for the year ended December 31, 2002, include $5,000,000 of additional rent which was re-allocated to the former Bradlees locations in Marlton, Turnersville, Bensalem and Broomall and is payable by Stop & Shop, pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, dated May 1, 1992.  This amount is in addition to all other rent guaranteed at the former Bradlees locations.  On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court claiming the Company has no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect the $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop because of the expiration of the East Brunswick, Jersey City, Middletown, Union and Woodbridge leases to which the $5,000,000 of additional rent was previously allocated.  The additional rent provision of the guaranty expires at the earliest in 2012.  The Company intends to vigorously contest Stop & Shop's position.
 
In February 2003, KoninKlijke Ahold NV, parent of Stop & Shop, announced that it overstated its 2002 and 2001 earnings by at least $500 million and is under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission.  The Company cannot predict what effect, if any, this situation involving KoninKlijke Ahold NV may have on Stop & Shop's ability to satisfy its obligation under the Bradlees guarantees and rent for existing Stop & Shop leases aggregating approximately $10,500,000 million per annum.
Except for the U.S. Government, which accounted for 11.4% of the Company's revenue, none of the Company's other tenants represented more than 10% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002.
 
As lessee:
The Company is a tenant under operating leases for certain properties. These leases will expire principally during the next thirty years.  Future minimum lease payments under operating leases at December 31, 2002, are as follows:
 
($ in thousands)
 
 
Rent expense was $17,157,000, $15,433,000, and $15,248,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000.
12.
           
Commitments and Contingencies
 
At December 31, 2002, the Company's $1,000,000,000 revolving credit facility had a zero balance, and the Company utilized $9,112,000 of availability under the facility for letters of credit and guarantees.  In addition there were $7,667,000 of other letters of credit outstanding.
 
In conjunction with the closing of Alexander's Lexington Avenue construction loan on July 3, 2002, the Company agreed to guarantee, among other things, the lien free, timely completion of the construction of the project and funding of all project costs in excess of a stated budget, as defined in the loan agreement, if not funded by Alexander's (see note 5 - Investments in Partially-Owned Entities).
 
Each of the Company's properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to the Company.
 
The Company carries comprehensive liability and all risk property insurance (fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance) with respect to its assets.  The Company's all risk insurance policies in effect before September 11, 2001 do not expressly exclude coverage for hostile acts, except for acts of war.  Since September 11, 2001, insurance companies have for the most part excluded terrorist acts from coverage in all risk policies.  The Company has generally been unable to obtain all risk insurance which includes coverage for terrorist acts for policies it has renewed since September 11, 2001, for each of its businesses.  In 2002, the Company obtained $200,000,000 of separate coverage for terrorist acts for each of its New York City Office, Washington, D.C. Office, Retail and Merchandise Mart businesses and $60,000,000 for its Temperature Controlled Logistics business.  Therefore, the Company is at risk for financial loss in excess of these limits for terrorist acts (as defined), which loss could be material.
 
The Company's debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by its properties (which are generally non-recourse to the Company), its senior unsecured notes due 2007 and its revolving credit agreement, contain customary covenants requiring the Company to maintain insurance.  There can be no assurance that the lenders under these instruments will not take the position that an exclusion from all risk insurance coverage for losses due to terrorist acts is a breach of these debt instruments that allows the lenders to declare an event of default and accelerate repayment of debt.  In the second quarter of 2002, the Company received correspondence from four lenders regarding terrorism insurance coverage, which the Company has responded to.  In these letters the lenders took the position that under the agreements governing the loans provided by these lenders the Company was required to maintain terrorism insurance on the properties securing the various loans.  The aggregate amount of borrowings under these loans as of December 31, 2002 was approximately $770.4 million, and there was no additional borrowing capacity.  Subsequently, the Company obtained an aggregate of $360 million of separate coverage for "terrorist acts".  To date, one of the lenders has acknowledged to the Company that it will not raise any further questions based on the Company's terrorism insurance coverage in place, and the other three lenders have not raised any further questions regarding the Company's insurance coverage.  If lenders insist on greater coverage for these risks, it could adversely affect the Company's ability to finance and/or refinance its properties and to expand its portfolio.
 
From time to time, the Company has disposed of substantial amounts of real estate to third parties for which, as to certain properties, it remains contingently liable for rent payments or mortgage indebtedness.
 
There are various legal actions against the Company in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.
 
The Company enters into agreements for the purchase and resale of U.S. government obligations for periods of up to one week. The obligations purchased under these agreements are held in safekeeping in the name of the Company by various money center banks. The Company has the right to demand additional collateral or return of these invested funds at any time the collateral value is less than 102% of the invested funds plus any accrued earnings thereon.  The Company had $33,393,000 and $15,235,000 of cash invested in these agreements at December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Related Party Transactions
 
Loan and Compensation Agreements
On May 29, 2002, Mr. Roth replaced common shares of the Company securing the Company's outstanding loan to Mr. Roth with options to purchase common shares of the Company with a value of not less than two times the loan amount.  As a result of the decline in the value of the options, Mr. Roth supplemented the collateral with cash and marketable securities.
 
At December 31, 2002, the loan due from Mr. Roth in accordance with his employment arrangement was $13,122,500 ($4,704,500 of which is shown as a reduction in shareholders' equity).  The loan bears interest at 4.49 % per annum (based on the applicable Federal rate) and matures in January 2006.  The Company also provided Mr. Roth with the right to draw up to $15,000,000 of additional loans on a revolving basis.  Each additional loan will bear interest, payable quarterly, at the applicable Federal rate on the date the loan is made and will mature on the sixth anniversary of the loan.
 
At December 31, 2002, loans due from Mr. Fascitelli, in accordance with his employment agreement, aggregated $8,600,000.  The loans which were scheduled to mature in 2003 have been extended to 2006 in connection with the extension of Mr. Fascitelli's employment agreement (discussed below), and bear interest, payable quarterly at a weighted average interest rate of 3.97% (based on the applicable Federal rate).
 
Pursuant to his 1996 employment agreement, Mr. Fascitelli became entitled to a deferred payment consisting of $5 million in cash and a convertible obligation payable November 30, 2001, at the Company's option, in either 919,540 Company common shares or the cash equivalent of their appreciated value, so long as such appreciated value is not less than $20 million.  The Company delivered 919,540 shares to a rabbi trust upon execution of the 1996 employment agreement.  The Company accounted for the stock compensation as a variable arrangement in accordance with Plan B of EITF No. 97-14 "Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where Amounts Earned Are Held in a Rabbi Trust and Invested" as the agreement permitted settlement in either cash or common shares.  Following the guidance in EITF 97-14, the Company recorded changes in fair value of its compensation obligation with a corresponding increase in the liability "Officer's Deferred Compensation".  Effective as of June 7, 2001, the payment date was deferred until November 30, 2004.  Effective as of December 14, 2001, the payment to Mr. Fascitelli was converted into an obligation to deliver a fixed number of shares (919,540 shares) establishing a measurement date for the Company's stock compensation obligation; accordingly the Company ceased accounting for the Rabbi Trust under Plan B of the EITF and began Plan A accounting.  Under Plan A, the accumulated liability representing the value of the shares on December 14, 2001, was reclassified as a component of Shareholders' Equity as "Deferred compensation shares earned but not yet delivered."  In addition, future changes in the value of the shares are no longer recognized as additional compensation expense.  The fair value of this obligation was $34,207,000 at December 31, 2002.  The Company has reflected this liability as Deferred Compensation Shares Not Yet Delivered in the Shareholders' Equity section of the balance sheet.  For the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company recognized approximately $4,744,000 and $3,733,000 of compensation expense of which $2,612,000 and $1,968,000 represented the appreciation in value of the shares in each period and $2,132,000 and $1,765,000 represented dividends paid on the shares.
 
Effective January 1, 2002, the Company extended its employment agreement with Mr. Fascitelli for a five-year period through December 31, 2006.  Pursuant to the extended employment agreement, Mr. Fascitelli is entitled to receive a deferred payment on December 31, 2006 of 626,566 Vornado common shares which are valued for compensation purposes at $27,500,000 (the value of the shares on March 8, 2002, the date the extended employment agreement was executed).  The shares are being held in a rabbi trust for the benefit of Mr. Fascitelli and vested 100% on December 31, 2002.  The extended employment agreement does not permit diversification, allows settlement of the deferred compensation obligation by delivery of these shares only, and permits the deferred delivery of these shares.  The value of these shares is being amortized ratably over the one year vesting period as compensation expense.
 
Pursuant to the Company's annual compensation review in February 2002 with Joseph Macnow, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, the Compensation Committee approved a $2,000,000 loan to Mr. Macnow, bearing interest at the applicable federal rate of 4.65% per annum and due January 1, 2006.  The loan, which was funded on July 23, 2002, was made in conjunction with Mr. Macnow's June 2002 exercise of options to purchase 225,000 shares of the Company's common stock.  The loan is collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the loan amount.  As a result of the decline in the value of the options, Mr. Macnow supplemented the collateral with cash and marketable securities.
One other executive officer of the Company has a loan outstanding pursuant to an employment agreement totaling $1,500,000 at December 31, 2002.  The loan matures in April 2005 and bears interest at the applicable Federal rate provided (4.5% at December 31, 2002).
 
Transactions with Affiliates and Officers and Trustees of the Company
 
Alexander's
 
The Company owns 33.1% of Alexander's.  Mr. Roth and Mr. Fascitelli are Officers and Directors of Alexander's and the Company provides various services to Alexander's in accordance with management and leasing agreements.  See Note 5 "Investments in Partially-Owned Entities" for further details.
 
The Company constructed a $16.3 million community facility and low-income residential housing development (the "30th Street Venture"), in order to receive 163,728 square feet of transferable development rights, generally referred to as "air rights".  The Company donated the building to a charitable organization.  The Company sold 106,796 square feet of these air rights to third parties at an average price of $120 per square foot.  An additional 28,821 square feet of air rights was purchased by Alexander's at a price of $120 per square foot for use at Alexander's 59th Street development project (the "59th Street Project").  In each case, the Company received cash in exchange for air rights.  The Company identified third party buyers for the remaining 28,111 square feet of air rights related to the 30th Street Venture.  These third party buyers wanted to use the air rights for the development of two projects located in the general area of 86th Street which was not within the required geographical radius of the construction site nor in the same Community Board as the low-income housing and community facility project.  The 30th Street Venture asked Alexander's to sell 28,111 square feet of the air rights it already owned to the third party buyers (who could use them) and the 30th Street Venture would replace them with 28,111 square feet of air rights.  In October 2002, the Company sold 28,111 square feet of air rights to Alexander's for an aggregate purchase price of $3,059,000 (an average of $109 per square foot).   Alexander's then sold an equal amount of air rights to the third party buyers for an aggregate purchase price of $3,339,000 (an average of $119 per square foot).
 
Interstate Properties
 
The Company currently manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate Properties pursuant to a management agreement for which the Company receives an annual fee equal to 4% of base rent and percentage rent and certain other commissions. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days' notice at the end of the term. Although the management agreement was not negotiated at arm's length, the Company believes based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies, that its terms are fair to the Company. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, $1,450,000, $1,655,000, and $1,418,000 of management fees were earned by the Company pursuant to the management agreement.
 
Building Maintenance Service Company ("BMS")
 
On January 1, 2003, the Company acquired BMS, a company which provides cleaning and related services primarily to the Company's Manhattan office properties, for $13,000,000 in cash from the estate of Bernard Mendik and certain other individuals including Mr. Greenbaum, an executive officer of the Company.  The Company paid BMS $53,024,000, $51,280,000, and $47,493,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 for services rendered to the Company's Manhattan office properties.  Although the terms and conditions of the contracts pursuant to which these services were provided were not negotiated at arm's length, the Company believes based upon comparable amounts charged to other real estate companies that the terms and conditions of the contracts were fair to the Company.
Vornado Operating Company
 
In October 1998, Vornado Operating Company ("Vornado Operating") was spun off from the Company in order to own assets that the Company could not itself own and conduct activities that the Company could not itself conduct.  The Company granted Vornado Operating a $75,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Agreement") which expires on December 31, 2004.  Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus 3%.  The Company receives a commitment fee equal to 1% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the facility.  No amortization is required to be paid under the Revolving Credit Agreement during its term.  The Revolving Credit Agreement prohibits Vornado Operating from incurring indebtedness to third parties (other than certain purchase money debt and certain other exceptions) and prohibits Vornado Operating from paying dividends.
 
Vornado Operating has disclosed that in the aggregate its investments do not, and for the foreseeable future are not expected to, generate sufficient cash flow to pay all of its debts and expenses.  Further, Vornado Operating states that its only investee, AmeriCold Logistics ("Tenant"), anticipates that its Landlord, a partnership 60% owned by the Company and 40% owned by Crescent Real Estate Equities, will need to restructure the leases between the Landlord and the Tenant to provide additional cash flow to the Tenant (the Landlord has previously restructured the leases to provide additional cash flow to the Tenant).  Management anticipates a further lease restructuring and the sale and/or financing of assets by AmeriCold Logistics, and accordingly, Vornado Operating is expected to have a source to repay the debt under this facility, which may be extended.  Since January 1, 2002, the Company has not recognized interest income on the debt under this facility.
 
Carthage Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas Quarries
,
 
On December 31, 2002, the Company and Crescent Real Estate Equities formed a joint venture to acquire the Carthage, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas quarries from AmeriCold Logistics, the tenant of the Temperature Controlled Logistics facilities for $20,000,000 in cash.  The Company contributed cash of $8,800,000 to the joint venture representing its 44% interest.  AmeriCold Logistics used the proceeds from the sale to repay a portion of a loan to Vornado Operating. Vornado Operating then repaid $9,500,000 of the amount outstanding under the Company's Revolving Credit Facility.  On December 31, 2002, the joint venture purchased $5,720,000 of trade receivables from AmeriCold Logistics at a 2% discount, of which the Company's share was $2,464,000.
 
Other
 
The Company owns preferred securities in Capital Trust, Inc. ("Capital Trust") totaling $29,212,000 at December 31, 2002.  Mr. Roth, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado Realty Trust, is a member of the Board of Directors of Capital Trust.
 
On May 17, 2001, the Company sold its 50% interest in 570 Lexington Avenue to the other venture partner, an entity controlled by the late Bernard Mendik, a former trustee and executive officer of the Company, for $60,000,000, resulting in a gain to the Company of $12,445,000.  The sale was initiated by the Company's partner and was based on a competitive bidding process handled by an independent broker.  The Company believes that the terms of the sale were at arm's length and were fair to the Company.
 
During 2002 and 2001, the Company paid $147,000 and $136,000 for legal services to a firm in which one of the Company's trustees is a member.
 
On January 1, 2001, the Company acquired the common stock of various preferred stock affiliates which was owned by Officers and Trustees of the Company and converted them to taxable REIT subsidiaries.  The total acquisition price was $5,155,000.  The purchase price, which was the estimated fair value, was determined by both independent appraisal and by reference to the individuals' pro rata share of the earnings of the preferred stock affiliates during the three-year period that these investments were held.
 
In connection with the Park Laurel condominium project, in 2001 the joint venture accrued $5,779,000 of awards under the venture's incentive compensation plan.

Costs of Acquisitions and Development Not Consummated
 
The Company has a 70% interest in a joint venture to develop an office tower over the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City.  Current market conditions have resulted in the joint venture writing off $9,700,000 in the fourth quarter of 2002, representing all pre-development costs capitalized to date, of which the Company's share is $6,874,000.
 
In 2001, the Company was unable to reach a final agreement with the Port Authority of NY & NJ to conclude a net lease of the World Trade Center.  Accordingly, the Company wrote-off costs of $5,223,000 primarily associated with the World Trade Center.

Segment Information
 
The Company has four business segments: Office, Retail, Merchandise Mart Properties and Temperature Controlled Logistics.  In 2003, the Company revised how it presents EBITDA, a measure of performance of its segments, and has revised the disclosure for all periods presented.  EBITDA as disclosed represents "Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization."  This change is consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G. Prior to 2001, income from the Company's preferred stock affiliates ("PSAs") was included in income from partially-owned entities.  On January 1, 2001, the Company acquired the common stock of its PSAs and converted these entities to taxable REIT subsidiaries.  Accordingly, the Hotel portion of the Hotel Pennsylvania and the management companies (which provide services to the Company's business segments and operate the Trade Show business of the Merchandise Mart division) have been consolidated effective January 1, 2001.  Amounts for the years ended December 31, 2000 have been reclassified to give effect to the consolidation of these entities as if consolidated as of January 1, 2000.  In addition, the Company has revised EBITDA as previously reported for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 to include income from the early extinguishment of debt of $1,170,000 in 2001 and expense from the early extinguishment of debt of $1,125,000 in 2000 because such items are no longer treated as extraordinary items in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
