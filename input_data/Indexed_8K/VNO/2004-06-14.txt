ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS
ISSUANCE OF SERIES D-11 PREFERRED UNITS BY VORNADO REALTY L.P.
        On May 27, 2004, Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership through which Vornado Realty Trust conducts its business (the "Operating Partnership"), sold $35 million of Series D-11 Preferred Units of limited partnership interest (the "Series D-11 Preferred Units") to an institutional investor in a private placement, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $34,125,000.
        The Series D-11 Preferred Units may be redeemed without penalty in whole or in part by the Operating Partnership at any time on or after May 27, 2009 for cash equal to $25 per Series D-11 Preferred Unit and any accumulated and unpaid distributions owing in respect of the Series D-11 Preferred Units being redeemed. At any time on or after the Series D-11 Effective Date (as defined below), holders of Series D-11 Preferred Units will have the right to have their Series D-11 Preferred Units redeemed by the Operating Partnership for (i) cash equal to the holder's capital account after the carrying values of all Operating Partnership assets are adjusted pursuant to the limited partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership and the holder's capital account is adjusted accordingly for the Series D-11 Preferred Units being redeemed or (ii) at the option of Vornado Realty Trust, one Series D-11 7.2% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest (liquidation preference $25 per share), no par value (the "Series D-11 Preferred Shares"), of Vornado Realty Trust for each Series D-11 Preferred Unit redeemed. The "Series D-11 Effective Date" means the sooner of (i) May 27, 2014, (ii) the first business day following any period in which the Operating Partnership has failed to make full distributions in respect of the Series D-11 Preferred Units for six quarters, whether or not consecutive, (iii) the first business day following receipt by the holder of the Series D-11 preferred Units of either notice from Vornado Realty Trust, or an opinion of counsel, that the Operating Partnership is or likely is a "publicly-traded partnership," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and (iv) the first business day following the date on which the institutional investor to which the Series D-11 Preferred Units were issued reasonably determines that there is an imminent and substantial risk that the Series D-11 Preferred Units held by it represent or will represent 19.5% or more of the total profits or capital interests in the Operating Partnership for a taxable year.
        The Series D-11 Preferred Shares will be perpetual and will be redeemable at the option of Vornado Realty Trust at any time on and after May 27, 2009 for cash equal to $25 per Series D-11 Preferred Share plus dividends accumulated and unpaid prior to the date of redemption. No Series D-11 Preferred Shares are now outstanding. Vornado Realty Trust and the purchaser of the Series D-11 Preferred Units have entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the Series D-11 Preferred Shares that may be issued upon redemption of Series D-11 Preferred Units.
        The press release attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.3 was provided in accordance with Rule 135c under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). Pursuant to the requirements of Rule 135c, the press release is filed and incorporated by reference into this Item 5.

        Vornado Realty Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust (the "Trust"), hereby certifies to the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland that:
        : Under a power contained in Article VI of the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust of the Trust (the "Declaration"), the Board of Trustees of the Trust (the "Board of Trustees"), established a Pricing Committee of the Board of Trustees which, by unanimous written consent, classified and designated, 2,200,000 shares (the "Shares") of the Preferred Stock, no par value per share (as defined in the Declaration), of the Trust as shares of Series D-11 7.2% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest, liquidation preference $25.00 per share, with the following preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption, which upon any restatement of the Declaration, shall be deemed to be part of Article VI of the Declaration, with any necessary or appropriate changes to the enumeration or lettering of sections or subsections hereof:
FIRST
         This series of Preferred Stock shall be designated as Series D-11 7.2% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest, liquidation preference $25.00 per share (the "Series D-11 Preferred Shares"), and 2,200,000 shall be the number of shares of Preferred Stock constituting such series.
Section 1.
.
Number of Shares and Designation
         For purposes of the Series D-11 Preferred Shares, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
Section 2.
.
Definitions
         (a) The holders of Series D-11 Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if authorized by the Board of Trustees and declared by the Trust out of assets legally available for that purpose, dividends payable in cash at the rate per annum of $1.80 per Series D-11 Preferred Share (the "Annual Dividend Rate"). Such dividends with respect to each Series D-11 Preferred Share shall be cumulative from the date on which such Series D-11 Preferred Share was issued by the Trust, whether or not in any Dividend Period or Periods there shall be assets of the Trust legally available for the payment of such dividends, and shall be payable quarterly, when, as and if authorized by the Board of Trustees and declared by the Trust, in arrears on Dividend Payment Dates commencing with respect to each Series D-11 Preferred Share on the first Dividend Payment Date after the date on which such Series D-11 Preferred Share was issued by the Trust. Dividends are cumulative from the most recent Dividend Payment Date to which dividends have been paid, whether or not in any Dividend Period or Periods there shall be assets legally available therefor. Each such dividend shall be payable in arrears to the holders of record of the Series D-11 Preferred Shares, as they appear on the share records of the Trust at the close of business on such record dates, not more than 30 days preceding the applicable Dividend Payment Date (the "Dividend Payment Record Date"), as shall be fixed by the Board of Trustees. Accumulated and unpaid dividends for any past Dividend Periods may be authorized and declared
Section 3.
.
Dividends
and paid at any time, without reference to any regular Dividend Payment Date, to holders of record on such date, not exceeding 45 days preceding the payment date thereof, as may be fixed by the Board of Trustees.
        (b) The amount of dividends payable for each full Dividend Period for each Series D-11 Preferred Share shall be computed by dividing the Annual Dividend Rate by four. The amount of dividends payable for the initial Dividend Period, or any other period shorter or longer than a full Dividend Period, on the Series D-11 Preferred Shares shall be computed on the basis of twelve 30-day months and a 360-day year. Holders of Series D-11 Preferred Shares shall not be entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, property or stock, in excess of cumulative dividends, as herein provided, on the Series D-11 Preferred Shares. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on the Series D-11 Preferred Shares that may be in arrears.
        (c) So long as any Series D-11 Preferred Shares are outstanding, no dividends, except as described in the immediately following sentence, shall be authorized and declared or paid or set apart for payment on any series or class or classes of Parity Shares for any period unless full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are authorized and declared and paid or authorized and declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payment on the Series D-11 Preferred Shares for all Dividend Periods terminating on or prior to the dividend payment date on such class or series of Parity Shares. When dividends are not paid in full or a sum sufficient for such payment is not set apart, as aforesaid, all dividends authorized and declared upon Series D-11 Preferred Shares and all dividends authorized and declared upon any other series or class or classes of Parity Shares shall be authorized and declared ratably in proportion to the respective amounts of dividends accumulated and unpaid on the Series D-11 Preferred Shares and such Parity Shares.
        (d) So long as any Series D-11 Preferred Shares are outstanding, no dividends (other than dividends or distributions paid solely in shares of, or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase shares of, Junior Shares) shall be authorized and declared or paid or set apart for payment or other distribution authorized and
declared or made upon Junior Shares, nor shall any Junior Shares be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired (other than a redemption, purchase or other acquisition of Common Shares made for purposes of and in compliance with requirements of an employee incentive or benefit plan of the Trust or any subsidiary, or as permitted under Article VI of the Declaration), for any consideration (or any moneys to be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of beneficial interest) by the Trust, directly or indirectly (except by conversion into or exchange for Junior Shares), unless in each case (i) the full cumulative dividends on all outstanding Series D-11 Preferred Shares and any other Parity Shares of the Trust shall have been paid or set apart for payment for all past Dividend Periods with respect to the Series D-11 Preferred Shares and all past dividend periods with respect to such Parity Shares and (ii) sufficient funds shall have been paid or set apart for the payment of the dividend for the current Dividend Period with respect to the Series D-11 Preferred Shares and any Parity Shares.
        (e) Any accumulated distributions on Series D-11 Preferred Units that remain unpaid at the time such Series D-11 Preferred Units are acquired by the Trust for Series D-11 Preferred Shares shall also be deemed to be accumulated and unpaid dividends in respect of such Series D-11 Preferred Shares as of the date of issuance of such Series D-11 Preferred Shares and shall be paid when declared by the Board of Trustees.
         (a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Trust, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any payment or distribution of the assets of the Trust (whether capital or surplus) shall be made to or set apart for the holders of Junior Shares, the holders of Series D-11 Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive Twenty Five Dollars ($25.00) per Series D-11 Preferred Share (the "Liquidation Preference") plus an amount equal to all dividends (whether or not earned or declared) accumulated and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution to such holder; but such holders of Series D-11 Preferred Shares shall not be entitled to any further payment. If, upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Trust, the assets of the Trust, or proceeds thereof, distributable among the holders of Series D-11 Preferred Shares shall be
Section 4.
.
Liquidation Preference
insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid and liquidating payments on any other Parity Shares, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of such Series D-11 Preferred Shares and any such other Parity Shares ratably in accordance with the respective amounts that would be payable on such Series D-11 Preferred Shares and any such other Parity Shares if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. For the purposes of this Section 4, (i) a consolidation or merger of the Trust with one or more entities, (ii) a statutory share exchange and (iii) a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Trust's assets, shall not be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, of the Trust.
        (b) Subject to the rights of the holders of shares of any series or class or classes of shares of beneficial interest ranking on a parity with or prior to the Series D-11 Preferred Shares upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Trust, after payment shall have been made in full to the holders of the Series D-11 Preferred Shares, as provided in this Section 4, any series or class or classes of Junior Shares shall, subject to any respective terms and provisions applying thereto, be entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holders of the Series D-11 Preferred Shares shall not be entitled to share therein.
           (a) Except as otherwise permitted by Article VI of the Declaration, the Series D-11 Preferred Shares shall not be redeemable by the Trust prior to May 27, 2009. On and after May 27, 2009, the Trust, at its option, may redeem the Series D-11 Preferred Shares, in whole or in part, as set forth herein, subject to the provisions described below, at a redemption price, payable in cash, equal to the Liquidation Preference plus dividends accumulated and unpaid prior to the date of redemption (the "Redemption Price").
Section 5.
.
Redemption at the Option of the Trust
        (b) If full cumulative dividends on the Series D-11 Preferred Shares and any other series or class or classes of Parity Shares of the Trust have not been paid or declared and set apart for payment, except as otherwise
permitted under Article VI of the Declaration, the Series D-11 Preferred Shares may not be redeemed in part and the Trust may not purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire Series D-11 Preferred Shares or any Parity Shares other than in exchange for Junior Shares.
        (c) If the Trust shall redeem shares of Series D-11 Preferred Shares pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 5, notice of such redemption shall be given to each holder of record of the Series D-11 Preferred Shares to be redeemed. Such notice shall be provided by first class mail, postage prepaid, at such holder's address as the same appears on the stock records of the Trust, or by publication in The Wall Street Journal or The New York Times, or if neither such newspaper is then being published, any other daily newspaper of national circulation. If the Trust elects to provide such notice by publication, it shall also promptly mail notice of such redemption to the holders of the Series D-11 Preferred Shares to be redeemed. Neither the failure to mail any notice required by this paragraph (c), nor any defect therein or in the mailing thereof, to any particular holder, shall affect the sufficiency of the notice or the validity of the proceedings for redemption with respect to the other holders. Any notice that was mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given on the date mailed whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such mailed or published notice shall state, as appropriate: (1) the date on which such Series D-11 Preferred Shares are to be redeemed (the "Redemption Date"); (2) the number of Series D-11 Preferred Shares to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the Series D-11 Preferred Shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such Series D-11 Preferred Shares to be redeemed from such holder; (3) the Redemption Price; (4) the place or places at which certificates for such Series D-11 Preferred Shares are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price; and (5) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed shall cease to accrue on such Redemption Date except as otherwise provided herein. Notice having been published or mailed as aforesaid, from and after the Redemption Date (unless the Trust shall fail to make available an amount of cash necessary to effect such redemption), (i) except as otherwise provided herein, dividends on the Series D-11 Preferred Shares so called for redemption shall cease to accumulate, (ii) said shares
shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and (iii) all rights of the holders thereof as holders of Series D-11 Preferred Shares of the Trust shall cease (except the right to receive the Redemption Price, without interest thereon, upon surrender and endorsement of their certificates if so required). The Trust's obligation to provide cash in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be deemed fulfilled if, on or before the Redemption Date, the Trust shall deposit with a bank or trust company (which may be an affiliate of the Trust) that has an office in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York, or in Baltimore, Maryland and that has, or is an affiliate of a bank or trust company that has, a capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000, the cash necessary for such redemption, in trust, with irrevocable instructions that such cash be applied to the redemption of the Series D-11 Preferred Shares so called for redemption. No interest shall accrue for the benefit of the holder of Series D-11 Preferred Shares to be redeemed on any cash so set aside by the Trust. Subject to applicable escheat laws, any such cash unclaimed at the end of two years from the Redemption Date shall revert to the general funds of the Trust, after which reversion the holders of such shares so called for redemption shall look only to the general funds of the Trust for the payment of such cash.
        As promptly as practicable after the surrender in accordance with said notice of the certificates for any such Series D-11 Preferred Shares so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Trust shall so require and if the notice shall so state), such Series D-11 Preferred Shares shall be exchanged for the cash (without interest thereon) for which such Series D-11 Preferred Shares have been redeemed. If fewer than all of the outstanding Series D-11 Preferred Shares are to be redeemed, the Series D-11 Preferred Shares to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trust from the outstanding Series D-11 Preferred Shares not previously called for redemption by lot or pro rata (as nearly as may be) or by any other method determined by the Trust in its sole discretion to be equitable. If fewer than all the Series D-11 Preferred Shares evidenced by any certificate are redeemed, then new certificates evidencing the unredeemed Series D-11 Preferred Shares shall be issued without cost to the holder thereof.
         All Series D-11 Preferred Shares which shall have been issued and reacquired in any manner by the Trust shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without designation as to series.
Section 6.
.
Reacquired Shares to Be Retired
         The Series D-11 Preferred Shares are not convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or securities of the Trust at the option of any holder of Series D-11 Preferred Shares.
Section 7.
.
No Right of Conversion
         In determining whether a distribution (other than upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up), whether by dividend, or upon redemption or other acquisition of shares or otherwise, is permitted under Maryland law, amounts that would be needed, if the Trust were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of holders of shares of any class or series of beneficial interest whose preferential rights upon dissolution are superior or prior to those receiving the distribution shall not be added to the Trust's total liabilities.
Section 8.
.
Permissible Distributions
         Any class or series of shares of beneficial interest of the Trust shall be deemed to rank:
Section 9.
.
Ranking
        (a) prior to the Series D-11 Preferred Shares, as to the payment of dividends and as to distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, if the holders of shares of such class or series shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of Series D-11 Preferred Shares ("Senior Shares");
        (b) on a parity with the Series D-11 Preferred Shares, as to the payment of dividends and as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, whether or not the dividend rates, dividend payment dates or redemption or liquidation prices per share thereof be different from those of the Series D-11 Preferred Shares, if the holders of shares of such class or series and the Series D-11 Preferred Shares shall be
entitled to the receipt of dividends and of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up in proportion to their respective amounts of accumulated and unpaid dividends per share or liquidation preferences, without preference or priority one over the other ("Parity Shares"); and
        (c) junior to the Series D-11 Preferred Shares, as to the payment of dividends or as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, if such shares shall be Common Shares or if the holders of Series D-11 Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of shares of such class or series, and shares of such class or series shall not in either case rank prior to the Series D-11 Preferred Shares.
        Accordingly, the Series A Convertible Preferred Shares, Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series D-1 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series D-2 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series D-3 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series D-4 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series D-5 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series D-6 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series D-7 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series D-8 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series D-9 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares and Series D-10 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares are Parity Shares.
         Except as otherwise set forth herein, the Series D-11 Preferred Shares shall not have any relative, participating, optional or other voting rights or powers, and the consent of the holders thereof shall not be required for the taking of any corporate (or trust) action.
Section 10.
.
Voting
        If and whenever six quarterly dividends (whether or not consecutive) payable on the Series D-11 Preferred Shares or any series or class of Parity Shares shall be in arrears (which shall, with respect to any such quarterly dividend, mean that any such dividend has not been paid in full) and whether or not earned or declared, the number of
trustees then constituting the Board of Trustees shall be increased by two and the holders of Series D-11 Preferred Shares, together with the holders of shares of every other series or class of Parity Shares having like voting rights (shares of any such other series, the "Voting Preferred Shares"), voting as a single class regardless of series, shall be entitled to elect the two additional trustees to serve on the Board of Trustees at any annual meeting of shareholders or special meeting held in place thereof, or at a special meeting of the holders of Series D-11 Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares called as hereinafter provided. Whenever all arrears in dividends on the Series D-11 Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares then outstanding shall have been paid and full dividends thereon for the current quarterly dividend period shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment, then the right of the holders of the Series D-11 Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares to elect such additional two trustees shall cease (but subject always to the same provision for the vesting of such voting rights in the case of any similar future arrearages in six quarterly dividends), and the terms of office of all persons elected as trustees by the holders of the Series D-11 Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares shall forthwith terminate and the number of trustees constituting the Board of Trustees shall be reduced accordingly. At any time after such voting power shall have been so vested in the holders of shares of Series D-11 Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares, the Secretary of the Trust may, and upon the written request of any holder of Series D-11 Preferred Shares (addressed to the Secretary at the principal office of the Trust) shall, call a special meeting of the holders of the Series D-11 Preferred Shares and of the Voting Preferred Shares for the election of the two trustees to be elected by them as herein provided, such call to be made by notice similar to that provided in the Bylaws of the Trust for a special meeting of the shareholders or as required by law. If any such special meeting required to be called as above provided shall not be called by the Secretary within 20 days after receipt of such request, then any holder of Series D-11 Preferred Shares may call such meeting, upon the notice above provided, and for that purpose shall have access to the stock books of the Trust. The trustees elected at any such special meeting shall hold office until the next annual
meeting of the shareholders or special meeting held in lieu thereof if such office shall not have previously terminated as above provided. If any vacancy shall occur among the trustees elected by the holders of the Series D-11 Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares, a successor shall be elected by the Board of Trustees, upon the nomination of the then-remaining trustee elected by the holders of the Series D-11 Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares or the successor of such remaining trustee, to serve until the next annual meeting of the shareholders or special meeting held in place thereof if such office shall not have previously terminated as provided above.
        So long as any Series D-11 Preferred Shares are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of shareholders required by the Declaration, the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of Series D-11 Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares, at the time outstanding, voting as a single class regardless of series, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating (a) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any of the provisions of the Declaration or these Articles Supplementary that materially and adversely affects the voting powers, rights or preferences of the Series D-11 Preferred Shares; , , that (i) the amendment of the provisions of the Declaration so as to authorize or create or to increase the authorized amount of, any Junior Shares or any shares of any class or series ranking on a parity with the Series D-11 Preferred Shares or the Voting Preferred Shares shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect the voting powers, rights or preferences of the holders of Series D-11 Preferred Shares and (ii) any filing with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland by the Trust in connection with a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Trust shall not be deemed to be an amendment, alteration or repeal of any of the provisions of the Declaration or these Articles Supplementary; and , that if any such amendment, alteration or repeal would materially and adversely affect any voting powers, rights or preferences of the Series D-11 Preferred Shares but not all series of Voting Preferred Shares at the time outstanding, the
provided
however
provided further
affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all series similarly affected at the time outstanding, voting as a single class regardless of series, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be required in lieu of the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the Series D-11 Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares otherwise entitled to vote in accordance herewith or (b) the authorization or creation of, or the increase in the authorized or issued amount of, any shares of any class or series or any security convertible into or exchangeable for shares of any class or series ranking prior to the Series D-11 Preferred Shares in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Trust or in the payment of dividends or distributions; , , that, in the case of each of subparagraphs (a) and (b), no such vote of the holders of Series D-11 Preferred Shares or Voting Preferred Shares, as the case may be, shall be required if, at or prior to the time when such amendment, alteration or repeal is to take effect, or when the issuance of any such prior shares or convertible security is to be made, provision is made for the redemption of all Series D-11 Preferred Shares or Voting Preferred Shares, as the case may be, at the time outstanding in accordance with Section 5 hereof.
provided
however
        For purposes of the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, each Series D-11 Preferred Share shall have one (1) vote per share, except that when any other series of Preferred Stock shall have the right to vote with the Series D-11 Preferred Shares as a single class on any matter, then the Series D-11 Preferred Shares and such other series shall have with respect to such matters one (1) vote per $50.00 of stated liquidation preference.
         The Trust and the Transfer Agent may deem and treat the record holder of any Series D-11 Preferred Shares as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the Trust nor the Transfer Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

Record Holders
         The Series D-11 Preferred Shares constitute

On and after the Redemption Date, distributions will cease to accumulate on the Series D-11 Preferred Units called for redemption, unless the Partnership defaults in payment therefor. If any date fixed for redemption of Series D-11 Preferred Units is not a Unit Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Unit Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Unit Business Day falls in the next calendar year, such payment will be made on the immediately preceding Unit Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date fixed for redemption. If payment of the Redemption Price is improperly withheld or refused and not paid by the Partnership, distributions on such Series D-11 Preferred Units will continue to accumulate from the original redemption date to the date of payment, in which case the actual payment date will be considered the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the applicable Redemption Price. Except as provided above, the Partnership shall make no payment or allowance for unpaid distributions, whether or not in arrears, on Series D-11 Preferred Units called for redemption under this Section 2.D.

            As promptly as practicable after the surrender of any such Series D-11 Preferred Units so redeemed, such Series D-11 Preferred Units shall be exchanged for the amount of cash (without interest thereon) payable therefore pursuant to Section 2.D(i). If fewer than all the Series D-11 Preferred Units represented by any physical certificate are
redeemed, then the Partnership shall issue new certificates representing the unredeemed Series D-11 Preferred Units without cost to the holder thereof.

In the event the General Partner shall exercise its right to satisfy the Series D-11 Redemption Right in the manner described in the first sentence of this paragraph (ii) and shall fully perform its obligations in connection therewith, the Partnership shall have no right or obligation to pay any amount to the Redeeming Partner with respect to such Redeeming Partner's exercise of the Series D-11 Redemption Right, and each of the Redeeming Partner, the Partnership and the General Partner shall, for federal income tax purposes, treat the transaction between the General Partner and the Redeeming Partner as a sale of the Redeeming Partner's Partnership Units to the General Partner. Nothing contained in this paragraph (ii) shall imply any right of the General Partner to require any holder of Series D-11 Preferred Units to exercise the Series D-11 Redemption Right afforded pursuant to paragraph (i) above.

In the event that the General Partner determines to pay the Redeeming Partner in the form of Series D-11 Preferred Shares, the General Partner shall issue to the Series D-11 Redeeming Partner one Series D-11 Preferred Share for each Series D-11 Preferred Unit being redeemed (subject to modification as set forth in paragraph (c) below), whereupon the General Partner shall acquire the Series D-11 Preferred Units offered for redemption by the Series D-11 Redeeming Partner and shall be treated for all purposes of the Agreement as the owner of such Series D-11 Preferred Units. Any accumulated and unpaid distributions on such Series D-11 Preferred Units to the date of such redemption shall also be deemed to have accumulated on the Series D-11 Preferred Shares paid to the Series D-11 Redeeming Partner in consideration of such Series D-11 Preferred Units at the time of the issuance of such Series D-11 Preferred Shares.
             (c)        In the event that there shall be outstanding at any time both Series D-11 Preferred Shares and Series D-11 Preferred Units and the General Partner shall be a party to any transaction (including, without limitation, a merger, consolidation or statutory share exchange with respect to the Series D-11 Preferred Shares), in each case as a result of which the Series D-11 Preferred Shares are converted into the right to receive shares of capital stock, other securities or other property (including cash or any
combination thereof), thereafter the Redemption Price payable by the General Partner in respect of one Series D-11 Preferred Unit shall be the kind and amount of shares of capital stock and other securities and property (including cash or any combination thereof) that was received upon consummation of such transaction in return for one Series D-11 Preferred Share; and the General Partner may not become a party to any such transaction unless the terms thereof are consistent with the foregoing. In case there shall be outstanding Series D-11 Preferred Units and no Series D-11 Preferred Shares and the General Partner shall be a party to any merger or consolidation in which the General Partner is not the surviving entity, then the Series D-11 Preferred Shares deliverable by the General Partner thereafter in redemption of Series D-11 Preferred Units pursuant to clause (ii) above shall be shares of the surviving entity or any entity controlling the surviving entity having the preferences, rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption substantially similar to those set forth on to this .
