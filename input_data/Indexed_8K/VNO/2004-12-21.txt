Indemnification of Underwriters
 
(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
 
(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
provided
 
(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including, subject to Section 6(c) hereof, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
 
, , that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto); and , , that the Company
provided
however
provided
further
 
shall not be liable to any Underwriter under the indemnity agreement in this subsection (a) to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from the fact that such Underwriter sold Securities to a person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus or the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented (excluding documents incorporated by reference) in any case where such delivery is required by the 1933 Act and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the Prospectus, any such amendment or supplement thereto or any such other document was corrected in the Prospectus or the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented if the Company has furnished prior to such confirmation sufficient copies thereof to such Underwriter.
 
(b) . Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Operating Partnership, their respective trustees, partners or officers, including without limitation, each of the officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Operating Partnership within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Operating Partnership by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment thereto).
Indemnification of Company, Operating Partnership, Trustees, Partners and Officers
 
(c) . Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; , , that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified

provided
however
 
party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d) . If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel in accordance with Section 6(a)(iii) hereof, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into, (iii) such indemnifying party, if it has not theretofore paid such reimbursement, is requested again to pay reimbursement at least five, but not more than ten, days prior to such settlement being entered into, and (iv) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
 
SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
 
The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus Supplement, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover.
 
The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to
 
above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 7, each officer or director, as the case may be, of each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each trustee, partner or officer, as the case may be, of the Company or the Operating Partnership, including without limitation each officer who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Operating Partnership within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company or the Operating Partnership, as the case may be.
 
SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriters or any controlling person of an Underwriter, or by or on behalf of the Company or the Operating Partnership or any officer or trustee or partner or controlling person of the Company or the Operating Partnership, and shall survive delivery of the Securities to the Underwriters.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery
 
SECTION 9. .
Termination of Agreement
 
(a) . The Representatives may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to Closing Time (i) if there has been, since the time of execution of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus, any material adverse change in or affecting the condition, financial or otherwise, or the earnings or business affairs of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) if there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States, or any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis or any change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the
Termination; General
 
Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to commence or continue the offering of the Securities to the public or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (iii) if trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or if trading generally on the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by any of such exchanges or by order of the Commission or any other governmental authority, or (iv) if a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities or (v) there shall have been any downgrading in the rating assigned to the Securities or any of the Company's other securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential downgrading in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
 
(b) . If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 6, 7 and 8 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.
Liabilities
 
SECTION 10. .
Default by One or More of the Underwriters
 
(a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase under this Agreement, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Representatives notify the Company that they has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in the Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement.
 
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives or the Company, or both, as provided in subsection (a) above, the number of Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-tenth of the number of the Securities to be purchased on such date, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the full amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives or the Company, or both, as provided in subsection (a) above, the number of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-tenth of the number of the Securities to be purchased on such date, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the party of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters provided in Section 4 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Sections 6 and 7 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

(b) If full cumulative dividends on the Series D-12 Preferred Shares and any other series or class or classes of Parity Shares of the Trust have not been paid or declared and set apart for payment, except as otherwise permitted under Article VI of the Declaration, the Series D-12 Preferred Shares may not be redeemed in part and the Trust may not purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire Series D-12 Preferred Shares or any Parity Shares other than in exchange for Junior Shares.
 
(c) If the Trust shall redeem shares of Series D-12 Preferred Shares pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 5, notice of such redemption shall be given to each holder of record of the Series D-12 Preferred Shares to be redeemed. Such notice shall be provided by first class mail, postage prepaid, at such holder's address as the same appears on the stock records of the Trust, or by publication in The Wall Street Journal or The New York Times, or if neither such newspaper is then being published, any other daily newspaper of national circulation. If the Trust elects to provide such notice by publication, it shall also promptly mail notice of such redemption to the holders of the Series D-12 Preferred Shares to be redeemed. Neither the failure to mail any notice required by this paragraph (c), nor any defect therein or in the mailing thereof, to any particular holder, shall affect the sufficiency of the notice or the validity of the proceedings for redemption with respect to the other holders. Any notice that was mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given on the date mailed whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such mailed or published notice shall state, as appropriate: (1) the date on which such Series D-12 Preferred Shares are to be redeemed (the "Redemption Date"); (2) the number of Series D-12 Preferred Shares to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the Series D-12 Preferred Shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such Series D-12 Preferred Shares to be redeemed from such holder; (3) the Redemption Price; (4) the place or places at which certificates for such Series D-12 Preferred Shares are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price; and (5) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed shall cease to accrue on such Redemption Date except as otherwise provided herein. Notice having been published or mailed as aforesaid, from and after the Redemption Date (unless the Trust shall fail to make available an amount of cash necessary to effect such redemption), (i) except as otherwise provided herein, dividends on the Series D-12 Preferred Shares so called for redemption shall cease to accumulate, (ii) said shares shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and (iii) all rights of the holders thereof as holders of Series D-12 Preferred Shares of the Trust shall cease (except the right to receive the Redemption Price, without interest thereon, upon surrender and endorsement of their certificates if so required). The Trust's obligation to provide cash in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be deemed fulfilled if, on or before the Redemption Date, the Trust shall deposit with a bank or trust company (which may be an affiliate of the Trust) that has an office in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York, or in Baltimore, Maryland and that has, or is an affiliate of a bank or trust company that has, a capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000, the cash necessary for such redemption, in trust, with irrevocable instructions that such cash be applied to the redemption of the Series D-12 Preferred Shares so called for redemption. No interest shall accrue for the benefit of the holder of Series D-12 Preferred Shares to be redeemed on any cash so set aside by the Trust. Subject to applicable escheat laws, any such cash unclaimed at the end of two years from the Redemption Date shall revert to the general funds of the Trust, after which reversion the holders of such shares so called for redemption shall look only to the general funds of the Trust for the payment of such cash.
 
As promptly as practicable after the surrender in accordance with said notice of the certificates for any such Series D-12 Preferred Shares so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Trust shall so require and if the notice shall so state), such Series D-12 Preferred Shares shall be exchanged for the cash (without interest thereon) for which such Series D-12 Preferred Shares have been redeemed. If fewer than all of the outstanding Series D-12 Preferred Shares are to be redeemed, the Series D-12 Preferred Shares to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trust from the outstanding Series D-12 Preferred Shares not previously called for redemption by lot or pro rata (as nearly as may be) or by any other method determined by the Trust in its sole discretion to be equitable. If fewer than all the Series D-12 Preferred Shares evidenced by any certificate are redeemed, then new certificates evidencing the unredeemed Series D-12 Preferred Shares shall be issued without cost to the holder thereof.
 
. All Series D-12 Preferred Shares which shall have been issued and reacquired in any manner by the Trust shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without designation as to series.
Section 6.
Reacquired Shares to Be Retired
 
. The Series D-12 Preferred Shares are not convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or securities of the Trust at the option of any holder of Series D-12 Preferred Shares.
Section 7.
No Right of Conversion
 
. In determining whether a distribution (other than upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up), whether by dividend, or upon redemption or other acquisition of shares or otherwise, is permitted under Maryland law, amounts that would be needed, if the Trust were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of holders of shares of any class or series of beneficial interest whose preferential rights upon dissolution are superior or prior to those receiving the distribution shall not be added to the Trust's total liabilities.
Section 8.
Permissible Distributions
 
. Any class or series of shares of beneficial interest of the Trust shall be deemed to rank:
Section 9.
Ranking
 
(a) prior to the Series D-12 Preferred Shares, as to the payment of dividends and as to distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, if the holders of shares of such class or series shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of Series D-12 Preferred Shares ("Senior Shares");
 
(b) on a parity with the Series D-12 Preferred Shares, as to the payment of dividends and as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, whether or not the dividend rates, dividend payment dates or redemption or liquidation prices per share thereof be different from those of the Series D-12 Preferred Shares, if the holders of shares of such class or series and the Series D-12 Preferred Shares shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends and of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up in proportion to their respective amounts of accumulated and unpaid dividends per share or liquidation preferences, without preference or priority one over the other ("Parity Shares"); and
 
(c) junior to the Series D-12 Preferred Shares, as to the payment of dividends or as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, if such shares shall be Common Shares or if the holders of Series D-12 Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of shares of such class or series, and shares of such class or series shall not in either case rank prior to the Series D-12 Preferred Shares.
 
Accordingly, the Series A Convertible Preferred Shares, Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series D-1 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series D-2 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series D-3 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series D-4 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series D-5 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series D-6 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series D-7 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series D-8 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series D-9 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series D-10 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series D 11 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares and Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares are Parity Shares.

Section 10.
Voting
 
If and whenever six quarterly dividends (whether or not consecutive) payable on the Series D-12 Preferred Shares or any series or class of Parity Shares shall be in arrears (which shall, with respect to any such quarterly dividend, mean that any such dividend has not been paid in full) and whether or not earned or declared, the number of trustees then constituting the Board of Trustees shall be increased by two and the holders of Series D-12 Preferred Shares, together with the holders of shares of every other series or class of Parity Shares having like voting rights (shares of any such other series, the "Voting Preferred Shares"), voting as a single class regardless of series, shall be entitled to elect the two additional trustees to serve on the Board of Trustees at any annual meeting of shareholders or special meeting held in place thereof, or at a special meeting of the holders of Series D-12 Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares called as hereinafter provided. Whenever all arrears in dividends on the Series D-12 Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares then outstanding shall have been paid and full dividends thereon for the current quarterly dividend period shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment, then the right of the holders of the Series D-12 Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares to elect such additional two trustees shall cease (but subject always to the same provision for the vesting of such voting rights in the case of any similar future arrearages in six quarterly dividends), and the terms of office of all persons elected as trustees by the holders of the Series D-12 Preferred Shares
 
and the Voting Preferred Shares shall forthwith terminate and the number of trustees constituting the Board of Trustees shall be reduced accordingly. At any time after such voting power shall have been so vested in the holders of shares of Series D-12 Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares, the Secretary of the Trust may, and upon the written request of any holder of Series D-12 Preferred Shares (addressed to the Secretary at the principal office of the Trust) shall, call a special meeting of the holders of the Series D-12 Preferred Shares and of the Voting Preferred Shares for the election of the two trustees to be elected by them as herein provided, such call to be made by notice similar to that provided in the Bylaws of the Trust for a special meeting of the shareholders or as required by law. If any such special meeting required to be called as above provided shall not be called by the Secretary within 20 days after receipt of such request, then any holder of Series D-12 Preferred Shares may call such meeting, upon the notice above provided, and for that purpose shall have access to the stock books of the Trust. The trustees elected at any such special meeting shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the shareholders or special meeting held in lieu thereof if such office shall not have previously terminated as above provided. If any vacancy shall occur among the trustees elected by the holders of the Series D-12 Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares, a successor shall be elected by the Board of Trustees, upon the nomination of the then-remaining trustee elected by the holders of the Series D-12 Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares or the successor of such remaining trustee, to serve until the next annual meeting of the shareholders or special meeting held in place thereof if such office shall not have previously terminated as provided above.
 
So long as any Series D-12 Preferred Shares are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of shareholders required by the Declaration, the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of Series D-12 Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares, at the time outstanding, voting as a single class regardless of series, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating (a) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any of the provisions of the Declaration or these Articles Supplementary that materially and adversely affects the voting powers, rights or preferences of the Series D-12 Preferred Shares; , that (i) the amendment of the provisions of the Declaration so as to authorize or create or to increase the authorized amount of, any Junior Shares or any shares of any class or series ranking on a parity with the Series D-12 Preferred Shares or the Voting Preferred Shares shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect the voting powers, rights or preferences of the holders of Series D-12 Preferred Shares and (ii) any filing with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland by the Trust in connection with a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Trust shall not be deemed to be an amendment, alteration or repeal of any of the provisions of the Declaration or these Articles Supplementary; and , that if any such amendment, alteration or repeal would materially and adversely affect any voting powers, rights or preferences of the Series D-12 Preferred Shares but not all series of Voting Preferred Shares at the time outstanding, the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all series similarly affected at the time outstanding, voting as a single class regardless of series, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the

provided, however
 
For purposes of the foregoing provisions of this Section 10, each Series D-12 Preferred Share shall have one (1) vote per share, except that when any other series of Preferred Stock shall have the right to vote with the Series D-12 Preferred Shares as a single class on any matter, then the Series D-12 Preferred Shares and such other series shall have with respect to such matters one (1) vote per $50.00 of stated liquidation preference.
 
Any increase in the authorized number of shares constituting the Series D-12 Preferred Shares for purposes of an issuance of such shares to persons other than to all of the then existing holders thereof on a pro rata basis will require the affirmative vote of 66-2/3% of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of Series D-12 Preferred Shares.
 
. The Trust and the Transfer Agent may deem and treat the record holder of any Series D-12 Preferred Shares as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the Trust nor the Transfer Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

(c) Upon any redemption of Series G Preferred Shares, the Trust shall pay any accrued and unpaid dividends in arrears for any Dividend Period ending on or prior to the Redemption Date. If the Redemption Date falls after a Dividend Payment Record Date and prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, then each holder of Series G Preferred Shares at the close of business on such Dividend Payment Record Date shall be entitled to the dividend payable on such Series G Preferred Shares on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the redemption of such Series G Preferred Shares before such Dividend Payment Date. Except as provided above, the Trust shall make no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on Series G Preferred Shares called for redemption.
 
(d) If full cumulative dividends on the Series G Preferred Shares and any other series or class or classes of Parity Shares of the Trust have not been paid or declared and set apart for payment, except as otherwise permitted under the Declaration, the Series G Preferred Shares may not be redeemed in part and the Trust may not purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire Series G Preferred Shares or any Parity Shares other than in exchange for Junior Shares.

The Trust's obligation to provide cash in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be deemed fulfilled if, on or before the Redemption Date, the Trust shall deposit with a bank or trust company (which may be an affiliate of the Trust) that has an office in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York, or in Baltimore, Maryland and that has, or is an affiliate of a bank or trust company that has, a capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000, the cash necessary for such redemption, in trust, with irrevocable instructions that such cash be applied to the redemption of the Series G Preferred Shares so called for redemption. No interest shall accrue for the benefit of the holder of Series G Preferred Shares to be redeemed on any cash so set aside by the Trust. Subject to applicable escheat laws, any such cash unclaimed at the end of two years from the Redemption Date shall revert to the general funds of the Trust, after which reversion the holders of such shares so called for redemption shall look only to the general funds of the Trust for the payment of such cash.
 
As promptly as practicable after the surrender in accordance with said notice of the certificates for any such Series G Preferred Shares so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Trust shall so require and if the notice shall so state), such Series G Preferred Shares shall be exchanged for the cash (without interest thereon) for which such Series G Preferred Shares have been redeemed. If fewer than all of the outstanding Series G Preferred Shares are to be redeemed, the Series G Preferred Shares to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trust from the outstanding Series G Preferred Shares not previously called for redemption by lot or pro rata (as nearly as may be) or by any other method determined by the Trust in its sole discretion to be equitable. If fewer than all the Series G Preferred Shares evidenced by any certificate are redeemed, then new certificates evidencing the unredeemed Series G Preferred Shares shall be issued without cost to the holder thereof.

In determining whether a distribution (other than upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up), whether by dividend, or upon redemption or other acquisition of shares or otherwise, is permitted under Maryland law, amounts that would be needed, if the Trust were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of holders of shares of any class or series of beneficial interest whose preferential rights upon dissolution are superior or prior to those receiving the distribution shall not be added to the Trust's total liabilities.
Permissible Distributions
 
Section 9. . Any class or series of shares of beneficial interest of the Trust shall be deemed to rank:
Ranking
 
(a) prior to the Series G Preferred Shares, as to the payment of dividends and as to distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, if the holders of such class or series shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of Series G Preferred Shares;
 
(b) on a parity with the Series G Preferred Shares, as to the payment of dividends and as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, whether or not the dividend rates, dividend payment dates or redemption or liquidation prices per share thereof be different from those of the Series G Preferred Shares, if the holders of such class or series and the Series G Preferred Shares shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends and of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up in proportion to their respective amounts of accrued and unpaid dividends per share or liquidation preferences, without preference or priority one over the other (""); and
Parity Shares
 
(c) junior to the Series G Preferred Shares, as to the payment of dividends or as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, if such class or series of shares shall be Common Shares or if the holders of Series G Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of shares of such class or series, and such class or series shall not in either case rank prior to the Series G Preferred Shares ("").

Section 10. . Except as otherwise set forth herein, the Series G Preferred Shares shall not have any relative, participating, optional or other voting rights or powers, and the consent of the holders thereof shall not be required for the taking of any trust action.
Voting
 
If and whenever six quarterly dividends (whether or not consecutive) payable on the Series G Preferred Shares or any series or class of Parity Shares shall be in arrears (which shall, with respect to any such quarterly dividend, mean that any such dividend has not been paid in full), whether or not earned or declared, the number of trustees then constituting the Board of Trustees shall be increased by two and the holders of Series G Preferred Shares, together with the holders of shares of every other series or class of Parity Shares having like voting rights (shares of any such other series, the ""), voting as a single class regardless of series, shall be entitled to elect the two additional trustees to serve on the Board of Trustees at any

annual meeting of shareholders or special meeting held in place thereof, or at a special meeting of the holders of Series G Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares called as hereinafter provided. Whenever all arrears in dividends on the Series G Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares then outstanding shall have been paid and full dividends thereon for the current quarterly dividend period shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment, then the right of the holders of the Series G Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares to elect such additional two trustees shall cease (but subject always to the same provision for the vesting of such voting rights in the case of any similar future arrearages in six quarterly dividends), and the terms of office of all persons elected as trustees by the holders of the Series G Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares shall forthwith terminate and the number of trustees constituting the Board of Trustees shall be reduced accordingly. At any time after such voting power shall have been so vested in the holders of shares of Series G Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares, the Secretary of the Trust may, and upon the written request of any holder of Series G Preferred Shares (addressed to the Secretary at the principal office of the Trust) shall, call a special meeting of the holders of the Series G Preferred Shares and of the Voting Preferred Shares for the election of the two trustees to be elected by them as herein provided, such call to be made by notice similar to that provided in the Bylaws of the Trust for a special meeting of the shareholders or as required by law. If any such special meeting required to be called as above provided shall not be called by the Secretary within 20 days after receipt of such request, then any holder of Series G Preferred Shares may call such meeting, upon the notice above provided, and for that purpose shall have access to the share books of the Trust. The trustees elected at any such special meeting shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the shareholders or special meeting held in lieu thereof if such office shall not have previously terminated as above provided. If any vacancy shall occur among the trustees elected by the holders of the Series G Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares, a successor shall be elected by the Board of Trustees, upon the nomination of the then-remaining trustee elected by the holders of the Series G Preferred Shares and the Voting Preferred Shares or the successor of such remaining trustee, to serve until the next annual meeting of the shareholders or special meeting held in place thereof if such office shall not have previously terminated as provided above.
