Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Entry into an Employment Agreement
On February 22, 2005, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Sandeep Mathrani, effective as of January 1, 2005.  Mr. Mathrani serves as Executive Vice PresidentRetail Division of the Company.  His prior employment agreement would have expired in March 2005.  The new employment agreement has a term through January 1, 2010 and the term automatically extends for additional one-year periods unless terminated on six month's prior notice by either the Company or Mr. Mathrani.  The employment agreement provides that Mr. Mathrani will receive a base salary of not less than $1,000,000, or, if the base salary is increased in the future, such increased amount.  In addition, Mr. Mathrani is guaranteed an annual bonus of at least $500,000 for 2005 and received a one-time cash bonus of $800,000 paid in February 2005.
Pursuant to the agreement, the Company granted Mr. Mathrani 16,836 shares of restricted stock and options to acquire 300,000 of the Company's common shares at $71.275 per share. In addition, 200,000 options will be granted over 2006 and 2007 at the then prevailing market price.  Both the restricted shares and the options will vest one-third each year on January 20th of 2008, 2009 and 2010.  The vesting of the restricted stock and the options will accelerate upon certain events including a change of control in the Company or a sale of its retail division.
Mr. Mathrani's employment agreement also provides that if his employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by him due to a material breach of the agreement by the Company Mr. Mathrani will immediately vest in any stock options and restricted shares granted to him by the Company.  In addition, in such event Mr. Mathrani will receive a lump sum payment equal to (i) one year of his annual base compensation plus (ii) the average of the annual bonuses earned by him in the two fiscal years ending immediately prior to his termination; this lump sum payment will be multiplied by two if the termination occurs during the first three years of the agreement.  The agreement further provides that if his employment is terminated by him without good reason or by the Company for cause (as defined in the agreement to include conviction of, or plea of guilty or to, a felony, failure to perform his duties or willful misconduct) payment of salary and all other obligations of the Company under the agreement will cease.
