Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
On May 12, 2005, Vornado Realty Trust (the "Company") completed an agreement with MONY Life Insurance Company ("MONY") to modify their 289,000 square foot lease, at the Company's Manhattan office building located at 1740 Broadway, effective April 1, 2005.  Under the modification agreement, the lease which was scheduled to expire in May 2016, will terminate as of March 29, 2007.  MONY will continue to pay rent through March 29, 2007 aggregating $22.2 million.  The Company has received a one-time payment of $9.6 million and will receive an additional $20.7 million paid monthly over the period from April 2007 through May 2016.
 
The $9.6 million payment and the $15.1 million present value of the $20.7 million will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the period from April 1, 2005 through March 29, 2007.  Further, the new termination date will cause the Company to accelerate the write-off of approximately $11.3 million of straight-lined rent receivable over the modified lease term.  As a result of the foregoing, beginning in the second quarter of 2005, in addition to the $2.8 million of quarterly rental revenue pursuant to the original lease agreement, the Company will also recognize an additional $1.7 million of rental revenue or $.01 per diluted share, each quarter through March 31, 2007.
