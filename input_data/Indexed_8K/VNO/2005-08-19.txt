ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS
 
This current report on Form 8-K updates Part II, Items 6, 7 and 8 of the Company's Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2004. Vornado Realty Trust (the "Company") is electing to re-issue in an updated format the presentation of its historical financial statements to reflect the reclassifications discussed below that have occurred during the first half of 2005.  These reclassifications had no effect on the Company's reported net income, funds from operations or related per share data.

On June 30, 2005, the Company made a decision not to sell Arlington Plaza and, accordingly, reclassified the related assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses as continuing operations for all periods presented in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2005.
 
In the first quarter of 2005, the Company began to redevelop 7 West 34 Street, a New York office building, into a permanent showroom building for the giftware industry.  In connection therewith, the Company reclassified the portion of the operations related to the showroom space to the Merchandise Mart segment and the operations related to the retail space to the Retail segment for all periods presented in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2005.

ITEM 6.
         
SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA:
 
 
(1)
  
FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT").  NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus specified non-cash items, such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity REITs.  FFO and FFO per diluted share should be evaluated along with GAAP net income and income per diluted share (the most directly comparable GAAP measures), as well as cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, in evaluating the operating performance of equity REITs.  Management believes that FFO and FFO per diluted share are helpful to investors as supplemental performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time.  Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, these non-GAAP measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs.  FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in the Company's Statements of Cash Flows.  FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company's operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2004, reflect the consolidation of the Company's investment in Americold Realty Trust beginning on November 18, 2004.  Previously, this investment was accounted for on the equity method.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2002, reflect the Company's January 1, 2002 acquisition of the remaining 66% of Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P. ("CESCR") and the resulting consolidation of CESCR's operations.
ITEM 7.
         
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 
Overview
 
The Company owns and operates office, retail and showroom properties with large concentrations of office and retail properties in the New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, D.C. and Northern Virginia area.  In addition, the Company has a 47.6% interest in an entity that owns and operates 88 cold storage warehouses nationwide.
 
The Company's business objective is to maximize shareholder value.  The Company measures its success in meeting this objective by the total return to its shareholders.  Below is a table comparing the Company's performance to the Morgan Stanley REIT Index ("RMS") for the following periods ending December 31, 2004:
 
 
(1)
  
Past performance is not necessarily indicative of how the Company will perform in the future.
(2)
  
From inception on July 25, 1995
 
The Company intends to continue to achieve its business objective by pursuing its investment philosophy and executing its operating strategies through:
 
Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit.
 - 
     
Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, D.C., where we believe there is high likelihood of capital appreciation.
 - 
     
Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents.
 - 
     
Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area.
 - 
     
Developing/redeveloping the Company's existing properties to increase returns and maximize value.
 - 
     
 
The Company competes with a large number of real estate property owners and developers.  Principal factors of competition are rent charged, attractiveness of location and quality and breadth of services provided.  The Company's success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national and local economies, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.  Economic growth has been fostered, in part, by low interest rates, Federal tax cuts, and increases in government spending.  To the extent economic growth stalls, the Company may experience lower occupancy rates which may lead to lower initial rental rates, higher leasing costs and a corresponding decrease in net income, funds from operations and cash flow.  Alternatively, if economic growth is sustained, the Company may experience higher occupancy rates leading to higher initial rents and higher interest rates causing an increase in the Company's weighted average cost of capital and a corresponding effect on net income, funds from operations and cash flow.

. 
On July 1, 2004, the Company acquired the Marriott hotel located in its Crystal City office complex from a limited partnership in which Robert H. Smith and Robert P.

On July 29, 2004, the Company acquired a real estate portfolio containing 25 supermarkets for $65,000,000 in cash.  These properties, all of which are located in Southern California and contain an aggregate of approximately 766,000 square feet, were purchased from the Newkirk MLP, in which the Company currently owns a 22.4% interest.  The supermarkets are net leased to Stater Brothers for an initial term expiring in 2008, with six 5-year extension options.  Stater Brothers is a Southern California regional grocery chain that operates 158 supermarkets and has been in business since 1936.
 
On August 30, 2004, the Company acquired a 68,000 square foot free-standing building in Forest Hills, New York for $26,500,000 in cash.  The property is located at 99-01 Queens Boulevard and its principal tenants are Rite Aid and Fleet Bank.

The Company contributed $4,462,000 of equity and provided a $24,000,000 bridge loan with interest at 10% per annum.

Investment in GMH Communities L.P.
 
On July 20, 2004, the Company committed to make up to a $159,000,000 convertible preferred investment in GMH Communities L.P. ("GMH"), a partnership focused on the student and military housing sectors.  Distributions accrued on the full committed balance of the investment, whether or not drawn, from July 20, 2004, at a rate of 16.27%.  In connection with this commitment, the Company received a placement fee of $3,200,000.  The Company also purchased for $1,000,000, warrants to acquire GMH common equity.  These warrants entitle the Company to acquire (i) 6,666,667 limited partnership units in GMH at an exercise price of $7.50 per unit and (ii) 5,496,724 limited partnership units, through May 6, 2006, at an exercise price of $9.10 per unit.  As of November 3, 2004, the Company had funded a total of $113,777,000 of the commitment.
 
On November 3, 2004, GCT closed its initial public offering ("IPO") at a price of $12.00 per share.  GCT is a real estate investment trust that conducts its business through GMH, of which it is the sole general partner.  In connection with the IPO, the $113,777,000 previously funded by the Company under the $159,000,000 commitment was repaid, together with accrued distributions of $13,381,000.  The Company also exercised warrants to purchase 6,666,667 limited partnership units at a price of $7.50 per unit, or $50,000,000 in total, which resulted in a net gain of $29,500,000.  The Company accounts for its interest in the partnership units on the equity-method based on its 12.25% ownership interest and right to appoint one of its executive officers to GCT's Board of Trustees.  The Company records its pro-rata share of GMH's net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis as the Company files its financial statements on Form 10-K or 10-Q prior to the time GMH files its financial statements.
Overview - continued
 
Under the warrant agreement, the number of GMH partnership units or GCT common shares underlying the warrants is adjusted for dividends declared by GCT.  On December 16, 2004, GCT declared a dividend of $.16 per common share, which increased the number of shares underlying the warrants from 5,496,724 to 5,563,417 and the exercise price was decreased from $9.10 to $8.99 per share.   Because these warrants are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains and losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the warrants at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in "interest and other investment income" on the Company's consolidated statement of income.  In the quarter ended December 31, 2004, the Company recognized income of $24,190,000 from the mark-to-market of these warrants, which were valued using a trinomial option pricing model based on GCT's closing stock price on the NYSE of $14.10 per share on December 31, 2004.
 
Further, in connection with the IPO, the Company contributed its 90% interest in Campus Club Gainesville, which it acquired in 2000, in exchange for an additional 671,190 GMH limited partnership units.
 
Of the Company's GMH units, 6,666,667 may be converted into an equivalent number of common shares of GCT commencing on May 2, 2005 and 671,190 units may be converted commencing on November 2, 2005.  The Company has agreed not to sell any common shares or units it owns or may acquire until May 2, 2005.
 
Investment in Sears, Roebuck and Co.
 
In July and August 2004, the Company acquired an aggregate of 1,176,600 common shares of Sears, Roebuck and Co. ("Sears") for $41,945,000, an average price of $35.65 per share. Included in the cost is $1,361,000 for a performance-based participation.  These shares are recorded as marketable securities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and are classified as "available for sale."  Appreciation or depreciation in the fair market value of these shares is recorded as an increase or decrease in "accumulated other comprehensive income" in the shareholders' equity section of the Company's consolidated balance sheet and not recognized in income.  At December 31, 2004, based on Sears' closing stock price of $51.03 per share, $18,105,000 of appreciation in the value of these shares was included in "accumulated other comprehensive income."
 
In August and September 2004, the Company acquired an economic interest in an additional 7,916,900 Sears common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which the Company purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on Sears common shares.  These call and put options have an initial weighted-average strike price of  $39.82 per share, or an aggregate of $315,250,000, expire in April 2006 and provide for net cash settlement.  Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points and is credited for the dividends received on the shares.  The options provide the Company with the same economic gain or loss as if it had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points.  Because these options are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the options at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in "interest and other investment income" on the Company's consolidated statement of income.  During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded net income of $81,730,000, comprised of (i) $88,782,000 from the mark-to-market of the options on December 31, 2004, based on Sears' closing stock price of $51.03 per share and (ii) $2,295,000 for accrued dividends, partially offset by (i) $5,972,000 for a performance-based participation, (ii) $2,371,000 for the increase in strike price resulting from the LIBOR charge and (iii) $1,004,000 of professional fees.
 
On November 16, 2004, Kmart Holding Corporation ("Kmart") and Sears entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger.  Upon the effective date of the merger, each share of Sears common stock will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder, (i) $50.00 in cash or (ii) 0.50 shares of common stock of the merged company, subject to proration so that 55% of the Sears shares are exchanged for shares of the merged company.
 
Based on Sears' most recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company's aggregate investment in Sears represents 4.2% of Sears' outstanding common shares.

2004 Dispositions
 
In anticipation of selling the Palisades Residential Complex, on February 27, 2004, the Company acquired the remaining 25% interest in the Palisades venture it did not previously own for approximately $17,000,000 in cash.  On June 29, 2004, the Company sold the Palisades for $222,500,000, which resulted in a gain on sale after closing costs of $65,905,000.

Overview  Leasing Activity
 
The following table summarizes, by business segment, the leasing statistics which the Company views as key performance indicators. 
 
 
In addition to the leasing activity in the table above, in the year ended December 31, 2004, 51,000 square feet of retail space included in the New York City Office segment was leased at an initial rent of $118.39 per square foot and in the three months ended December 31, 2004, 9,000 square feet of retail space was leased at an initial rent of $73.86 per square foot.
Overview  Leasing Activity  continued
 
(1)
  
Most leases include periodic step-ups in rent, which are not reflected in the initial rent per square foot leased.
(2)
  
Excludes Crystal Plazas 3 and 4 containing an aggregate of 497 square feet which were taken out of service for redevelopment.  See discussion of Crystal City PTO space below.
Overview  Leasing Activity  continued
Crystal City PTO Space
 
The PTO vacated 937,000 square feet in Crystal City in the fourth quarter of 2004, of which 497,000 has been taken out of service, and will vacate another 1,002,000 square feet during 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.  As of February 1, 2005, the Company has leased 416,000 square feet of the PTO space vacated.  Of this space, 262,000 square feet was leased to the Federal Supply Service which will be relocated from 240,000 square feet in other Crystal City buildings, 122,000 square feet was leased to the Public Broadcasting Service and 32,000 square feet was leased to Lockheed Martin.
 
Below is a comparison of the Company's actual leasing activity to the Company's projection for the lease-up of this space:
 
 
Straight-line rent per square foot for the actual square feet leased is $32.34 as compared to $31.94 projected.  Actual tenant improvements and leasing commissions per square foot is $45.25 as compared to $45.28 projected.
 
The Company's original redevelopment plans for the PTO space included taking Crystal Park One and Crystal Plaza Three and Four out of service.  Plans for Crystal Plaza Three and Four have not changed.  Current plans for Crystal Park One are to lease its 224,000 square feet to private sector tenants, which will not require taking the building out of service, as opposed to leasing it to another government agency which would have required taking it out of service.  As a result, the Company will recognize approximately $4,000,000 of expense in 2005, which under the original plan would have been capitalized as part of development costs.
Critical Accounting Policies
 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.   The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the Company's accounting policies included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K/A.
 
Real Estate
 
Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.  As of December 31, 2004, the Company's carrying amount of its real estate, net of accumulated depreciation is $8.3 billion.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.  Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components.  If the Company does not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimates the useful lives of its real estate, depreciation expense may be misstated.
 
Upon acquisitions of real estate, the Company assesses the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles such as acquired above and below market leases and acquired in-place leases and customer relationships) and acquired liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141: Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and allocates purchase price based on these assessments.  The Company assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property.  The Company's properties, including any related intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.  If the Company incorrectly estimates the values at acquisition or the undiscounted cash flows, initial allocations of purchase price and future impairment charges may be different.  The impact of the Company's estimates in connection with acquisitions and future impairment analysis could be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
Identified Intangible Assets
 
Upon an acquisition of a business the Company records intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill.  The Company amortizes identified intangible assets that are determined to have finite lives which are based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired.  Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset, including the related real estate when appropriate, is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value.
 
As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the carrying amounts of the Company's identified intangible assets are $176,122,000 and $130,915,000, respectively.  Such amounts are included in "other assets" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.  In addition, the Company has $70,264,000 and $48,884,000, of identified intangible liabilities as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, which are included in "deferred credit" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  If these assets are deemed to be impaired, or the estimated useful lives of finite-life intangibles change, the impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements could be material.
Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable
 
The Company's policy is to record mortgages and notes receivable at the stated principal amount net of any discount or premium.  As of December 31, 2004, the carrying amount of Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable was $440,186,000.  The Company accretes or amortizes any discounts or premiums over the life of the related loan receivable utilizing the effective interest method.  The Company evaluates the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of its loans, if circumstances warrant, to determine whether it is impaired. A loan is considered to be impaired, when based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is considered to be impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loan's effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  The impact of the Company's estimates in connection with the collectibility of both interest and principal of its loans could be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
Partially-Owned Entities
 
As of December 31, 2004, the carrying amount of investments and advances to partially-owned entities, including Alexander's, was $605,300,000.  In determining whether the Company has a controlling interest in a partially-owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, it considers factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which it will absorb the majority of the entity's expected losses, if they occur, or receive the majority of the expected residual returns, if they occur, or both. The Company has concluded that it does not have a controlling ownership interest with respect to the Company's 80% interest in Starwood Ceruzzi Venture, and 50% interests in Monmouth Mall, Wells Kinzie, Orleans Hubbard and 825 Seventh Avenue.
 
The Company consolidates entities that it is able to control.  The Company accounts for investments on the equity method when its ownership interest is greater than 20% and less than 50%, and the Company does not have direct or indirect control.  When partially-owned entities are in partnership form, the 20% threshold may be reduced.  Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Company's share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions to and from these entities.  All other investments are accounted for on the cost method.
 
On a periodic basis the Company evaluates whether there are any indicators that the value of the Company's investments in partially-owned entities are impaired.  The ultimate realization of the Company's investment in partially-owned entities is dependent on a number of factors including the performance of the investee and market conditions.  If the Company determines that a decline in the value of the investee is other than temporary, an impairment charge would be recorded.
 
Allowance For Doubtful Accounts
 
The Company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts ($17,339,000 as at December 31, 2004) for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreement.  The Company also maintains an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents ($6,787,000 as at December 31, 2004).  This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements.  Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates.  These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
 
The Company has the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:
 - 
   
Base Rents  income arising from tenant leases.  These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases.
 - 
   
Percentage Rents  income arising from retail tenant leases which are contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold.  These rents are recognized in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104: Revenue Recognition, which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e. sales thresholds have been achieved).
 - 
   
Hotel Revenues  income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue.  Income is recognized when rooms are occupied.  Food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered.
 - 
   
Trade Show Revenues  income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths.  This revenue is recognized in accordance with the booth rental contracts when the trade shows have occurred.
 - 
   
Expense Reimbursements  revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property.  This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.
 - 
   
Temperature Controlled Logistics revenue  income arising from the Company's investment in Americold.  Storage and handling revenue is recognized as services are provided.  Transportation fees are recognized upon delivery to customers.
 - 
   
Management, Leasing and Other Fees  income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially-owned entities.  This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements.
 
Before the Company recognizes revenue, it assesses among other things, its collectibility.  If the Company's assessment of the collectibility of its revenue changes, the impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements could be material.
 
Taxes
Income
 
The Company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT") under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. The Company intends to distribute to its shareholders 100% of its taxable income.  Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.  If the Company fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders, or fails to meet other REIT requirements, it may fail to qualify as a REIT and substantial adverse tax consequences may result.
Net income and EBITDA (1) for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.
 
Below is a summary of net income and EBITDA(1) by segment for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.  On January 1, 2003, the Company revised its definition of EBITDA to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G concerning non-GAAP financial measures.  The revised definition of EBITDA includes minority interest, gains (losses) on the sale of depreciable real estate and income arising from the straight-lining of rent and the amortization of acquired in-place leases.  Accordingly, EBITDA for all periods disclosed represents "Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization."  Management considers EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of its segments as it is related to the return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity.  As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, management utilizes this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of its assets to that of its peers.  EBITDA is not a surrogate for net income because net income is after interest expense and accordingly, is a measure of return on equity as opposed to return on assets.
 
 
Included in EBITDA (1) are (i) gains on sale of real estate of $75,755, of which $9,850 and $65,905 are in the Retail and Other segments, respectively, and (ii) net gains from the mark-to-market and conversion of derivative instruments of $135,372 and certain other gains and losses that affect comparability which are in the Other segment.  Excluding these items the percentages of EBITDA by segment are 62.4% for Office, 16.9% for Retail, 13.3% for Merchandise Mart, 7.0% for Temperature Controlled Logistics and 0.4% for Other.
 
See Notes on page 22.
 
Included in EBITDA are gains on sale of real estate of $161,789, of which $157,200 and $4,589 are in the Office and Retail segments, respectively.  Excluding these items, the percentages of EBITDA by segment are 69.8% for Office, 16.3% for Retail, 14.5% for Merchandise Mart, 8.9% for Temperature Controlled Logistics and (9.5)% for Other.
 
See Notes on page 22.
 
See Notes on the following page.
Notes to the preceding tabular information:
 
(1)
  
EBITDA represents "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization."  EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income.  EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.
(2)
  
Interest and debt expense and depreciation and amortization included in the reconciliation of net income to EBITDA reflects the Company's share of the interest and debt expense and depreciation and amortization of its partially-owned entities.
(3)
  
Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2004 reflect the consolidation of the Company's investment in Americold Realty Trust beginning on November 18, 2004.  Previously, this investment was accounted for on the equity method.  See page 47 for condensed pro forma operating results of Americold Realty Trust for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, giving effect to the acquisition of its tenant, Americold Logistics, as if it had occurred on January 1, 2003.

Other EBITDA is comprised of:
 
 
(A)
     
EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes the Company's $2,901 share of impairment losses recorded by Newkirk MLP, partially offset by the Company's $2,705 share of gains on sale of real estate.  EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes the Company's $9,900 share of gains on sale of real estate and early extinguishment of debt, partially offset by a charge of $1,210 for an impairment loss and a litigation settlement.  The remaining decrease in EBITDA from 2003 to 2004 is due primarily to the sale of properties (primarily Stater Brothers Supermarkets).
(B)
      
Interest and other income for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes a gain of $7,494 resulting from the exercise of an option by the Company's joint venture partner to acquire certain MLP units held by the Company.  The MLP units subject to this option had been issued to the Company on behalf of the Company's joint venture partner in exchange for the Company's operating partnership units as part of the tender offers to acquire certain of the units of the MLP in 1998 and 1999.
(C)
      
Includes Alexander's stock appreciation rights compensation expense, of which the Company's share was $25,340, $14,868 and $0 for the year ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  The year ended December 31, 2004, also includes the Company's $1,274 share of a gain on sale of land parcel and the Company's $1,010 share of Alexander's loss on early extinguishment of debt.
(D)
     
The Company's share of EBITDA for the period from November 3, 2004 to December 31, 2004, will be recognized in the quarter ended March 31, 2005, as the investee has not published its earnings for the year ended December 31, 2004 prior to the filing of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K.

On August 12, 2004, the Company sold its Dundalk, Maryland shopping center for $12,900,000, which resulted in a net gain on sale after closing costs of $9,850,000.
EBITDA
 
Below are the details of the changes by segment in EBITDA.
 
 
(1)
  
Represents operations which were owned for the same period in each year and excludes non-recurring income and expenses which are included in acquisitions, dispositions and non-same store income and expenses above.
(2)
  
EBITDA and the same store percentage increase were $330,689 and 4.4% for the New York office portfolio and $304,200 and 1.7% for the CESCR portfolio.
(3)
  
EBITDA and the same store percentage increase reflect the commencement of the WPP Group leases (228 square feet) in the third quarter of 2004 and the Chicago Sun Times lease (127 square feet) in the second quarter of 2004.  EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2004, exclusive of the incremental impact of these leases was $131,296 or a 5.6% same store increase over the prior year.
(4)
  
Not comparable because prior to November 4, 2004, (date the operations of AmeriCold Logistics were combined with Americold Realty Trust), the Company reflected its equity in the rent Americold received from AmeriCold Logistics.  Subsequent thereto, the Company reflects its equity in the operations of the combined company.  See page 47 for condensed pro forma operating results of Americold for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, giving effect to the acquisition of its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, as if it had occurred on January 1, 2003.
Results of Operations - Years Ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002
 
Revenues
 
The Company's revenues, which consist of property rentals, tenant expense reimbursements, hotel revenues, trade shows revenues, amortization of acquired below market leases net of above market leases pursuant to SFAS No. 141 and 142, and fee income, were $1,502,850,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $1,392,239,000 in the prior year, an increase of $110,611,000.  Below are the details of the increase (decrease) by segment:
 
 
See notes on following page.
 
See Leasing Activity on page 13 for further details and corresponding changes in occupancy.
Notes to preceding tabular information:
 
(1)
    
Average occupancy and REVPAR for the Hotel Pennsylvania were 64% and $58 for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 65% and $58 for the prior year.
 
(2)
    
Reflects an increase of $2,841 resulting from the rescheduling of two trade shows from the fourth quarter of 2002, in which they were previously held to the first quarter of 2003, and $1,400 relates to a new show held for the first time in 2003, partially offset by lower trade show revenue in 2003 primarily due to a smaller April Market show as a result of a conversion of trade show space to permanent space.
 
(3)
    
Reflects increases of $13,251 from New York City Office leasing activity and $2,901 from CESCR's leasing activity.  These increases resulted primarily from higher rents for space relet in 2003 and 2002 (full year impact in 2003 as compared to a partial year in 2002) and an increase in CESCR occupancy of .3% this year, partially offset by a decrease in NYC office occupancy of .6%.  Initial rent for the 677 square feet of space relet in New York City was $44.41 per square foot in 2003, a 15.3% increase over prior escalated rent.  Initial rent for the 2,510 square feet of space relet in CESCR portfolio was $30.62 per square foot, a 2.5% increase over prior escalated rents.  For further details of NYC and CESCR office leasing activity see page 13.

Resulted primarily from (i) an increase in the occupancy rate from 88.3% at December 31, 2002 to 93.0% at December 31, 2003 as a result of leasing space previously vacated by Bradlees and Kmart and (ii) higher rents for space relet in 2003 and 2002 (full year impact in 2003 as compared to a partial year in 2002).  Initial rent for the 1,046 square feet of space relet in 2003 was $15.56 per square foot, a 13.2% increase over prior rent.  For further details of Retail leasing activity see page 13.
 
(5)
    
Reflects an increase in occupancy of Merchandise Mart office space of 0.9% from 2002, higher rents for 1,157 square feet of showroom space relet in 2003 and 911 square feet relet in 2002 (full year impact in 2003 as compared to partial year impact in 2002), partially offset by a decrease in Merchandise Mart showroom occupancy of .1% from 2002 and lower rents for 270 square feet of office space relet in 2003.  Initial rents for the 1,157 square feet of showroom space relet in 2003 was $23.43, a 0.6% increase over prior escalated rent.  Initial rents for the 270 square feet of office space relet in 2003 was $21.24, a 5.3% decrease over prior escalated rent.  For further details of Merchandise Mart leasing activity see page 13.
 
(6)
    
Reflects higher reimbursements from tenants resulting primarily from increases in real estate taxes.  The increases in Office and Retail were $19,383 and $3,247, before reductions of $2,215 and $1,407 in the current quarter relating to the true-up of prior year's billings.
 
(7)
    
Results primarily from a $3,444 decrease in CESCR third party leasing revenue from $7,100 in 2002 to $3,656 in 2003 as a result of the closing of one of the CESCR leasing offices.
Expenses
 
The Company's expenses were $919,540,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $852,370,000 in the prior year, an increase of $67,170,000.  Below are the details of the increase (decrease) by segment:
 
 
See notes on following page.
Notes to preceding tabular information:
 
(1)
  
The increase in Hotel Pennsylvania's operating expenses was primarily due to a $1,700 increase in real estate taxes and a $500 increase in utility costs over the prior year.
 
(2)
  
Results primarily from the rescheduling of two trade shows from the fourth quarter of 2002, in which they were previously held to the first quarter of 2003, and due to a new trade show held for the first time in 2003.
 
(3)
  
Below are the details of the increases (decreases) in operating expenses by segment:
 
 
(a) Relates primarily to an increase in New York Office.
 
(4)
  
Increases in depreciation and amortization for the Office and Merchandise Mart segments are primarily due to additions to buildings and improvements.
 
(5)
  
The increase in general and administrative expenses results from:
 
 
As part of the 2002 annual compensation review, in lieu of stock options, on January 28, 2003 the Company granted 166,990 restricted shares at $34.50 per share (the then closing stock price on the NYSE) to employees of the Company.  These awards vest over a 5-year period.  Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  In the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $1,898,000 (excluding severance charges), of which $1,020,000 related to January 2003 restricted stock awards.
Income Applicable to Alexander's
 
Income applicable to Alexander's (interest income, management, leasing, development and commitment fees, and equity in income) was $15,574,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $29,653,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $14,079,000.  This decrease resulted primarily from (i) Alexander's stock appreciation rights compensation expense of which the Company's share was $14,868,000 in 2003 compared to zero in 2002, partially offset by (ii) Alexander's gain on the sale of its Third Avenue property of which the Company's share was $3,524,000 in 2002, and (iii) income resulting from the commencement of the lease with Bloomberg (87% of the space) on November 15, 2003 at Alexander's 731 Lexington Avenue property of which the Company's share was $1,589,000.
 
Income from Partially-Owned Entities
 
Below are the condensed statements of operations of the Company's unconsolidated subsidiaries as well as the increase (decrease) in income from these partially-owned entities for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002:
 
 
See notes on following page.
Notes to preceding tabular information:
 
(1)
  
The increase reflects the Company's share of the following items from the Newkirk MLP in 2003, including (i) $7,200 of net gains on the sale of 11 properties, (ii) a gain of $1,600 on the early extinguishment of debt, partially offset by, (iii) a charge of $538 in connection with a litigation claim, (iv) a charge of $353 for an asset impairment and (v) $930 in Federal and state taxes.
 
(2)
  
The Company reflects its 60% share of Vornado Crescent Portland Partnership's (the "Landlord") rental income it receives from AmeriCold Logistics, its tenant, which leases the underlying temperature controlled warehouses used in its business.  The Company's joint venture does not recognize rental income unless earned and collection is assured or cash is received.  The Company did not recognize $25,087 of rent it was due for the year ended December 31, 2003, which together with previously deferred rent was $49,436 at December 31, 2003.  The following summarizes the increase in income for the year ended December 31, 2003 over the prior year:
 
 
(3)
  
The Company acquired a 50% interest in the Monmouth Mall on October 10, 2002.  Equity in net income of the Monmouth Mall includes the Company's preferred return of $3,290 and $748 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.
 
(4)
  
On September 23, 2002, the Company acquired the remaining 50% of the Mall and 25% of the Kmart anchor store it did not previously own.  Accordingly, the operations of Las Catalinas are consolidated into the accounts of the Company subsequent to September 23, 2002.
Interest and Other Investment Income
 
Interest and other investment income (interest income on mortgage loans receivable, other interest income and dividend income) was $25,401,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $31,685,000 in the year ended December 31, 2002, a decrease of $6,284,000.  This decrease resulted primarily from (i) lower average investments at lower yields, partially offset by (ii) $5,655,000 of contingent interest income recognized in connection with the repayment of the Dearborn Center loan and (iii) $5,028,000 of interest income recognized on the $225,000,000 GM Building mezzanine loans, for the period from October 20, 2003 through December 31, 2003.
 
Interest and Debt Expense
 
Interest and debt expense was $230,064,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $234,113,000 in the year ended December 31, 2002, a decrease of $4,049,000.  This decrease was primarily comprised of a $11,285,000 savings from a 77 basis point reduction in weighted average interest rates of the Company's variable rate debt, partially offset by (i) the consolidation as of September 2002 of the Las Catalinas operations which were previously included in income from partially-owned entities, (ii) a full year of interest expense on the Company's $500,000,000 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2007 which were issued in June 2002 and (iii) a reduction in interest capitalized in connection with development projects.
 
Net (Loss) Gain on Disposition of Wholly-owned and Partially-owned Assets other than Depreciable Real Estate
 
The following table sets forth the details of net (loss) gain on disposition of wholly-owned and partially-owned assets other than depreciable real estate for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002:
 
 
Primestone Foreclosure and Impairment Losses
 
On September 28, 2000, the Company made a $62,000,000 loan to Primestone Investment Partners, L.P. ("Primestone").  The loan bore interest at 16% per annum.  Primestone defaulted on the repayment of this loan on October 25, 2001. The loan was subordinate to $37,957,000 of other debt of the borrower that liened the Company's collateral. On October 31, 2001, the Company purchased the other debt for its face amount.  The loans were secured by 7,944,893 partnership units in Prime Group Realty, L.P., the operating partnership of Prime Group Realty Trust (NYSE:PGE) and the partnership units are exchangeable for the same number of common shares of PGE.  The loans were also guaranteed by affiliates of Primestone.
 
On November 19, 2001, the Company sold, pursuant to a participation agreement with a subsidiary of Cadim inc., a Canadian pension fund, a 50% participation in both loans at par for approximately $50,000,000, reducing the Company's net investment in the loans at December 31, 2001 to $56,768,000, including unpaid interest and fees of $6,790,000.  The participation did not meet the criteria for "sale accounting" under SFAS 140 because Cadim was not free to pledge or exchange the assets.
On April 30, 2002, the Company and Cadim acquired the 7,944,893 partnership units at a foreclosure auction.   The price paid for the units by application of a portion of Primestone's indebtedness to the Company and Cadim was $8.35 per unit, the April 30, 2002 closing price of shares of PGE on the New York Stock Exchange.  On June 28, 2002, pursuant to the terms of the participation agreement, the Company transferred 3,972,447 of the partnership units to Cadim.
 
In the second quarter of 2002, in accordance with foreclosure accounting, the Company recorded a loss on the Primestone foreclosure of $17,671,000 calculated based on (i) the acquisition price of the units and (ii) its valuation of the amounts realizable under the guarantees by affiliates of Primestone, as compared with the net carrying amount of the investment at April 30, 2002.   In the third quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a $2,229,000 write-down on its investment based on costs expended to realize the value of the guarantees.  Further, in the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a $15,857,000 write-down of its investment in Prime Group consisting of (i) $14,857,000 to adjust the carrying amount of the Prime Group units to $4.61 per unit, the closing price of PGE shares on the New York Stock Exchange at December 31, 2002 and (ii) $1,000,000 for estimated costs to realize the value of the guarantees.  The Company considered the decline in the value of the units which are convertible into stock to be other than temporary as of December 31, 2002, based on the fact that the market value of the stock had been less than its cost for more than six months, the severity of the decline, market trends, the financial condition and near-term prospects of Prime Group and other relevant factors.
 
At December 31, 2002, the Company's carrying amount of the investment was $23,908,000, of which $18,313,000 represents the carrying amount of the 3,972,447 partnership units owned by the Company ($4.61 per unit), $6,100,000 represents the amount expected to be realized under the guarantees, partially offset by $1,005,000 representing the Company's share of Prime Group's net loss through September 30, 2002, as the Company recorded its share of Prime Group's earnings on a one-quarter lag basis.
 
On June 11, 2003, the Company exercised its right to exchange the 3,972,447 units it owned in Prime Group Realty L.P. for 3,972,447 common shares in Prime Group Realty Trust.  Prior to the exchange, the Company accounted for its investment in the partnership on the equity method.  Subsequent to the exchange, the Company is accounting for its investment in PGE as a marketable equity security-available for sale, as the Company's shares represent less than a 20% ownership interest in PGE (which is not a partnership), the Company does not have significant influence and the common shares have a readily determinable fair value.  Accordingly, the carrying amount previously included in Investments and Advances to Partially-Owned Entities was reclassified to Marketable Securities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.  The Company is also required to mark these securities to market based on the closing price of the PGE shares on the NYSE at the end of each reporting period.  For the period from June 11, 2003 through December 31, 2003, the Company recorded a $6,623,000 unrealized gain, which is not included in the Company's net income, but is reflected as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Shareholders' Equity section of the consolidated balance sheet.  From the date of exchange, income recognition is limited to dividends received on the PGE shares.
 
On June 13, 2003, the Company received its $5,000,000 share of a settlement with affiliates of Primestone Investment Partners of the amounts due under the guarantees of the Primestone loans.  In connection therewith, the Company recognized a $1,388,000 loss on settlement of the guarantees, which has been reflected as a component of "net gains (losses) on disposition of wholly-owned and partially-owned assets" in the Company's 2003 consolidated statement of income.
 
Gain on Transfer of Mortgages
 
In the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded a net gain of $2,096,000 resulting from payments to the Company by third parties that assumed certain of the Company's mortgages.  Under these transactions the Company paid to the third parties that assumed the Company's obligations the outstanding amounts due under the mortgages and the third parties paid the Company for the benefit of assuming the mortgages.  The Company has been released by the creditors underlying these loans.
 
Net Gain on Sale of Air Rights
 
In 2002, the Company constructed a $16.3 million community facility and low-income residential housing development (the "30th Street Venture"), in order to receive 163,728 square feet of transferable development rights, generally referred to as "air rights".  The Company donated the building to a charitable organization.  The Company sold 106,796 square feet of these air rights to third parties at an average price of $120 per square foot.  An additional 28,821 square feet of air rights was sold to Alexander's at a price of $120 per square foot for use at Alexander's 59th Street development project (the "59th Street Project").  In each case, the Company received cash in exchange for air rights.  The Company identified third party buyers for the remaining 28,111 square feet of air rights of the 30th Street Venture.  These third party buyers wanted to use the air rights for the development of two projects located in the general area of 86th Street which was not within the required geographical radius of the construction site nor in the same Community Board as the low-income housing and community facility project.  The 30th Street Venture asked Alexander's to sell 28,111 square feet of the air rights it already owned to the third party buyers (who could use them) and the 30th Street Venture would replace them with 28,111 square feet of air rights.
In October 2002, the Company sold 28,111 square feet of air rights to Alexander's for an aggregate sales price of $3,059,000 (an average of $109 per square foot).   Alexander's then sold an equal amount of air rights to the third party buyers for an aggregate sales price of $3,339,000 (an average of $119 per square foot).
 
Gains on Sale of Residential Condominium Units
Net
 
The Company recognized net gains of $282,000 and $2,156,000 during 2003 and 2002, from the sale of residential condominiums.
 
Minority Limited Partners' Interest in the Operating Partnership
 
Minority limited partners' interest in the Operating Partnership was $105,132,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $64,899,000 for the prior year, an increase of $40,233,000.  The increase is primarily due to higher income in 2003, primarily as a result of net gains on sale of real estate of $161,789,000, and an increase in preferred unit distributions of $2,187,000, representing the original issuance costs on the redemption of the Series D-1 preferred units.
 
Discontinued Operations
 
Assets related to discontinued operations consist primarily of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation.  The following table sets forth the balances of the assets related to discontinued operations as of December 31, 2003 and 2002.
 
 
The following table sets forth the balances of the liabilities related to discontinued operations (primarily mortgage notes payable) as of December 31, 2003 and 2002.
 
 
The combined results of operations of the assets related to discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 are as follows:
 
On January 9, 2003, the Company sold its Baltimore, Maryland shopping center for $4,752,000, which resulted in a net gain after closing costs of $2,644,000.
 
On October 10, 2003, the Company sold Two Park Avenue, a 965,000 square foot office building, for $292,000,000, which resulted in a net gain on the sale after closing costs of $156,433,000.
 
On November 3, 2003, the Company sold its Hagerstown, Maryland shopping center for $3,100,000, which resulted in a net gain on sale after closing costs of $1,945,000.
 
Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle
 
In September 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 142, (effective January 1, 2002).  SFAS No. 142 specifies that goodwill and some intangible assets will no longer be amortized but instead be subject to periodic impairment testing.  In the first quarter of 2002, the Company wrote-off goodwill of approximately $30,129,000 of which (i) $15,490,000 represents its share of the goodwill arising from the Company's investment in Temperature Controlled Logistics and (ii) $14,639,000 represents goodwill arising from the Company's acquisition of the Hotel Pennsylvania.  The write-off was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the 2002 consolidated statement of income.

EBITDA
 
Below are the details of the changes by segment in EBITDA.
 
 
(1)
  
Represents operations which were owned for the same period in each year and excludes non-recurring income and expenses which are included in acquisitions, dispositions and non-same store income and expenses above.
(2)
  
EBITDA and the same store percentage increase (decrease) were $476,522 ($319,989 excluding gains on sale of real estate of $156,533) and 3.3% (excluding such gains) for the New York office portfolio and $292,270 and (1.7%) for the CESCR portfolio.  36% of the same store decrease at CESCR reflects a reduction in third party net leasing fees.
(3)
  
The Company reflects its 60% share of Vornado Crescent Portland Partnership's (the "Landlord") rental income it receives from AmeriCold Logistics, its tenant, which leases the underlying temperature controlled warehouses used in its business.  The Company's joint venture does not recognize rental income unless earned and collection is assured or cash is received.  The Company did not recognize $25,087 of rent it was due for the year ended December 31, 2003, which together with previously deferred rent is $49,436.  The tenant has advised the Landlord that (i) its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 from the warehouses it leases from the Landlord, is lower than last year by 1.3%, and (ii) its gross profit before rent at these warehouses for the corresponding period is higher than last year by $607 (a 0.4% increase).  In addition, in 2003, the tenant and the Landlord had lower general and administrative expenses and the Landlord received $885 of EBITDA from its investment in the quarries it acquired in December 2002 which was reflected in the gross profit of the tenant in the prior year.

The third quarter of the Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically been impacted by higher net utility costs than in each other quarter of the year;
 - 
     
The fourth quarter of the Retail segment has historically been higher than each of the first three quarters due to the recognition of percentage rental income; and
 - 
     
The second and fourth quarter of the Merchandise Mart segment have historically been higher than the first and third quarters due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters.

Investment in Americold Realty Trust
 
Prior to November 18, 2004, the Company owned a 60% interest in Vornado Crescent Portland Partnership ("VCPP") which owned Americold Realty Trust ("Americold").  Americold owns 88 temperature controlled warehouses, all of which were leased to AmeriCold Logistics.  On November 4, 2004, Americold purchased its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, for $47,700,000 in cash.  On November 18, 2004, the Company and its 40% partner, Crescent Real Estate Equities Company ("CEI") collectively sold 20.7% of Americold's common shares to The Yucaipa Companies ("Yucaipa") for $145,000,000, which resulted in a gain, of which the Company's share was $18,789,000. The sale price was based on a $1.450 billion valuation for Americold before debt and other obligations.  Yucaipa is a private equity firm with significant expertise in the food distribution, logistics and retail industries.  Upon closing of the sale to Yucaipa on November 18, 2004, Americold is owned 47.6% by the Company, 31.7% by CEI and 20.7% by Yucaipa. Pursuant to the sales agreement: (i) Yucaipa may earn a promote of 20% of the increase in the value of Americold through December 31, 2007, limited to 10% of the Company's and CEI's remaining interest in Americold; (ii) the annual asset management fee payable by CEI to the Company has been reduced from approximately $5,500,000 to $4,548,000, payable quarterly through October 30, 2027.  CEI, at its option, may terminate the payment of this fee at any time after November 2009, by paying the Company a termination fee equal to the present value of the remaining payments through October 30, 2027, discounted at 10%.  In addition, CEI is obligated to pay a pro rata portion of the termination fee to the extent it sells a portion of its equity interest in Americold; and (iii) VCPP was dissolved.  The Company has the right to appoint three of the five members to Americold's Board of Trustees.  Consequently, the Company is deemed to exercise control over Americold and, on November 18, 2004, the Company began to consolidate the operations and financial position of Americold into its accounts and no longer accounts for its investment on the equity method.
 
The following is a pro forma presentation of the results of operations of Americold for the three months and years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, giving effect to the acquisition of AmeriCold Logistics as if it had occurred on January 1, 2003.
 
 
Revenue was $701,707,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $655,286,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $46,421,000.  The increase in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily due to (i) $36,406,000 from Americold's transportation management services business from both new and existing customers, (ii) $6,692,000 from new managed warehouse contracts, net of a contract termination in the fourth quarter of 2004 and (iii) an increase in handling and accessorial services.
Gross margin from owned warehouses was $150,515,000 or 34.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $159,909,000, or 36.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of $9,394,000.  This decrease was primarily attributable to (i) lower productivity related to new business at the Atlanta warehouses, (ii) lower average occupancy at the Carthage warehouse and (iii) a change in revenue mix as higher margin storage revenues declined and lower margin handling revenues increased.
 
Gross margin from other operations (i.e., transportation, management services and managed warehouses) was $5,221,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $13,093,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of $7,872,000.  This decrease was primarily the result of (i) a $5,062,000 change in the estimate of unbilled transportation revenue, (ii) lower margins in the transportation management services business due to tightened truck supply in 2004 as a result of new legislation reducing the hours that drivers are permitted to drive in a day, partially offset by (iii) an increase in gross margin from new and existing managed warehouse customers.
 
Interest expense was $52,285,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $41,634,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $10,651,000.  The increase was primarily due to higher average debt outstanding as Americold obtained a mortgage financing on 28 of its unencumbered properties in February 2004.
 
General and administrative expense was $32,940,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $35,355,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $2,415,000.  This decrease resulted primarily from a lower bonus provision.
 
Other expense, net, was $11,137,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to other income, net, of $601,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of $11,738,000.  This decrease resulted primarily from (i) $7,569,000 for the write-off of the remaining net book value of two vacant warehouse facilities and assets related to a managed warehouse contract that was terminated 2004, (ii) $2,241,000 of income in 2003 resulting from a tax refund, and (iii) a gain of $850,000 in 2003 resulting from a sale of warehouse.

Loan and Compensation Agreements
 
In accordance with the terms of the employment arrangement with Steven Roth, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, and subject to a letter agreement dated November 1999, Mr. Roth may draw up to $15,000,000 of loans on a revolving basis.  Each loan bears interest, payable quarterly, at the applicable Federal rate on the date the loan is made and matures on the sixth anniversary of such loan.  Loans are collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the amount outstanding.  At December 31, 2004, the outstanding balance under this arrangement was $13,122,500 (of which $4,704,500 is shown as a reduction in shareholders' equity).  The amount outstanding matures in January 2006 and bears interest at a weighted average rate of 4.49% per annum.
 
At December 31, 2004, the balance of the loan due from Michael Fascitelli, the Company's President, in accordance with his employment agreement was $8,600,000.  The loan matures in December 2006 and bears interest, payable quarterly, at a weighted average rate of 3.97% (based on the applicable Federal rate).
 
Effective January 1, 2002, the Company extended its employment agreement with Mr. Fascitelli for a five-year period through December 31, 2006.  Pursuant to the extended employment agreement, Mr. Fascitelli is entitled to receive a deferred payment on December 31, 2006 of 626,566 Vornado common shares which are valued for compensation purposes at $27,500,000 (the value of the shares on March 8, 2002, the date the extended employment agreement was executed).  The shares are held in a rabbi trust for the benefit of Mr. Fascitelli and vested 100% on December 31, 2002.  The extended employment agreement does not permit diversification, allows settlement of the deferred compensation obligation by delivery of these shares only, and permits the deferred delivery of these shares.  The value of these shares was amortized ratably over the one-year vesting period as compensation expense.
 
Pursuant to the Company's annual compensation review in February 2002 with Joseph Macnow, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, the Compensation Committee approved a $2,000,000 loan to Mr. Macnow, bearing interest at the applicable federal rate of 4.65% per annum and due in June 2007.  The loan was funded on July 23, 2002 and is collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the loan amount.
 
On March 11, 2004, the Company loaned $2,000,000 to Melvyn Blum, an executive officer of the Company, pursuant to the revolving credit facility contained in his January 2000 employment agreement.  The loan bears interest at 1.57% per annum (the Federal rate) and is due in March 2007.
 
On February 22, 2005, the Company and Sandeep Mathrani, Executive Vice President  Retail Division, entered into a new employment agreement.  Pursuant to the agreement, the Company granted Mr. Mathrani (i) 16,836 restricted shares of the Company's stock, (ii) stock options to acquire 300,000 of the Company's common shares at an exercise price of $71.275 per share and (iii) the right to receive 200,000 stock options over the next two years at the then prevailing market price.  In addition, Mr. Mathrani repaid the $500,000 loan the Company provided him under his prior employment agreement.
 
Transactions with Affiliates and Officers and Trustees of the Company
 
Alexander's
 
The Company owns 33% of Alexander's.  Mr. Roth and Mr. Fascitelli are Officers and Directors of Alexander's, the Company provides various services to Alexander's in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements and the Company has made loans to Alexander's aggregating $124,000,000 at December 31, 2004.  These agreements and the loans are described in Note 5 - Investments in Partially-Owned Entities to the Company's consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K/A.  In addition, in 2002, the Company sold air rights to Alexander's, details of which are provided in Note 3  Acquisitions and Dispositions to the Company's consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K/A.
Interstate Properties
 
As of December 31, 2004, Interstate Properties and its partners beneficially owned approximately 10.8% of the common shares of beneficial interest of the Company and 27.4% of Alexander's common stock.  Interstate Properties is a general partnership in which Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the partners.  Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the managing general partner of Interstate Properties, and the Chief Executive Officer and a director of Alexander's.  Messrs. Mandelbaum and Wight are trustees of the Company and also directors of Alexander's.
 
The Company manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate Properties pursuant to a management agreement for which the Company receives an annual fee equal to 4% of base rent and percentage rent.  The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days' notice at the end of the term. The Company believes based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies that its terms are fair to the Company.  The Company earned $726,000, $703,000 and $747,000 of management fees under the management agreement for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.  In addition, during fiscal years 2003 and 2002, as a result of a previously existing leasing arrangement with Alexander's, Alexander's paid to Interstate $587,000 and $703,000, respectively, for the leasing and other services actually rendered by the Company.  Upon receipt of these payments, Interstate promptly paid them over to the Company without retaining any interest therein.  This arrangement was terminated at the end of 2003 and all payments by Alexander's thereafter for these leasing and other services are made directly to the Company.
 
Vornado Operating Company ("Vornado Operating")
 
In October 1998, Vornado Operating was spun off from the Company in order to own assets that the Company could not itself own and conduct activities that the Company could not itself conduct.  Vornado Operating's primary asset was its 60% investment in AmeriCold Logistics, which leased 88 refrigerated warehouses from Americold, owned 60% by the Company.  The Company granted Vornado Operating a $75,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility that was to expire on December 31, 2004.  Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bore interest at LIBOR plus 3%.  The Company received a commitment fee equal to 1% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the facility.  At the time of its dissolution referred to below, Vornado Operating had outstanding 4,068,924 shares and its operating partnership had outstanding 447,017 units.  At such time, trustees and officers of the Company held approximately 24.3% of the common shares and units of Vornado Operating.  In addition, Messrs. Roth, Fascitelli, Macnow, Wight and West each served as an officer and/or director of Vornado Operating.
 
On December 31, 2002, the Company and Crescent Real Estate Equities formed a joint venture to acquire the Carthage, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas quarries from AmeriCold Logistics for $20,000,000 in cash (appraised value).  The Company contributed cash of $8,800,000 to the joint venture representing its 44% interest.  AmeriCold Logistics used the proceeds from the sale to repay a portion of a loan to Vornado Operating.  Vornado Operating then repaid $9,500,000 of the amount outstanding under the Company's revolving credit facility.   In addition, during 2004 and 2003, this joint venture acquired $21,930,000 and $5,720,000 of trade receivables from AmeriCold Logistics for $21,500,000 and $5,606,000, respectively.  These receivables were subsequently collected in full.
 
On November 4, 2004, Americold purchased its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, for $47,700,000 in cash.  As part of this transaction, Vornado Operating repaid the $21,989,000 balance of the loan to the Company as well as $4,771,000 of unpaid interest.  Because the Company fully reserved for the interest income on this loan beginning in January 2002, it recognized $4,771,000 of income upon collection in the fourth quarter 2004.
 
further but limited information before holding an additional hearing regarding the settlement, which has been scheduled for March 2005.  The Company has accrued the proposed settlement payment and related legal costs as part of "general and administrative expense" in the fourth quarter of 2004.  The Company believes that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
In November 2004, a class action shareholder derivative lawsuit was brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Vornado Operating, its directors and the Company.  The lawsuit sought to enjoin the dissolution of Vornado Operating, rescind the previously completed sale of AmeriCold Logistics (owned 60% by Vornado Operating) to Americold Realty Trust (owned 60% by the Company) and damages.  In addition, the plaintiffs claimed that the Vornado Operating directors breached their fiduciary duties.  On November 24, 2004, a stipulation of settlement was entered into under which the Company agreed to settle the lawsuit with a payment of approximately $4.5 million or about $1 per Vornado Operating share or partnership unit before litigation expenses. The proposed settlement payment would be in addition to the liquidation distribution of $2 per Vornado Operating share or unit that Vornado Operating made to its equity-holders when it dissolved on December 29, 2004.  On January 20, 2005, the Delaware Court of Chancery postponed deciding upon the proposed settlement and requested

During 2002, the Company paid approximately $147,000 for legal services to a firm in which one of the Company's trustees is a member.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
The Company anticipates that cash from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund its business operations, dividends to shareholders and distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership and recurring capital expenditures, and together with existing cash balances will be greater than its anticipated cash requirements including development and redevelopment expenditures and debt amortization.  Capital requirements for significant acquisitions may require funding from borrowings or equity offerings.

On February 3, 2005, the registration statement was declared effective.
 
Certain Future Cash Requirements
 
For 2005 the Company has budgeted approximately $180,000,000 for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions as follows:
 
 
(1)   Hotel Pennsylvania, Paramus Office and Warehouses.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2004, actual cash basis capital expenditures and leasing commissions were $186,850,000, as compared to a budget of $194,200,000.
 
In addition to the capital expenditures reflected above, the Company is currently engaged in certain development and redevelopment projects for which it has budgeted approximately $470,000,000.  Of this amount, $310,000,000 is estimated to be expended in 2005.
 
The table above excludes Americold's 2005 budget of $23,000,000 for capital expenditures as Americold is expected to fund these expenditures without contributions from the Company.  In addition, no cash requirements have been budgeted for the capital expenditures of Alexander's, Newkirk MLP, or any other entity that is partially owned by the Company.  These investees are also expected to fund their own cash requirements.

At December 31, 2004, the Company has $567,851,000 available under its $600,000,000 revolving credit facility (
$32,149,000
 
The Company's credit facility contains customary conditions precedent to borrowing such as the bring down of customary representations and warranties as well as compliance with financial covenants such as minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization.  The facility provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in the Company's ratings below Baa3/BBB.  This facility also contains customary events of default that could give rise to acceleration and include such items as failure to pay interest or principal and breaches of financial covenants such as maintenance of minimum capitalization and minimum interest coverage.
 
The Company carries comprehensive liability and all risk property insurance ((i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended coverage, (iv) "acts of terrorism" as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 which expires in 2005 and (v) rental loss insurance) with respect to its assets.  In April 2004, the Company reviewed its all risk policies and increased its coverage for Acts of Terrorism for each of its New York Office, CESCR Office, Retail and Merchandise Mart divisions.

In addition to the coverage above, the Company carries lesser amounts of coverage for terrorist acts not covered by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002.
 
The Company's debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by its properties (which are generally non-recourse to the Company), its senior unsecured notes due 2007, 2009 and 2010 and its revolving credit agreement, contain customary covenants requiring the Company to maintain insurance. Although the Company believes that it has adequate insurance coverage under these agreements, the Company may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future.  Further if lenders insist on greater coverage than the Company is able to obtain, or if the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 is not extended; it could adversely affect the Company's ability to finance and/or refinance its properties and expand its portfolio.
 
In conjunction with the closing of Alexander's Lexington Avenue construction loan on July 3, 2002, the Company agreed to guarantee to the construction lender, the lien free, timely completion of the construction of the project and funding of all project costs in excess of a stated budget, as defined in the loan agreement, if not funded by Alexander's.

Funds From Operations ("FFO")
 
FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus specified non-cash items, such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity REITs. FFO and FFO per diluted share should be evaluated along with GAAP net income and income per diluted share (the most directly comparable GAAP measures), as well as cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, in evaluating the operating performance of equity REITs. Management believes that FFO and FFO per diluted share are helpful to investors as supplemental performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, these non-GAAP measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in the Company's Statements of Cash Flows. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company's operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.  The calculations of both the numerator and denominator used in the computation of income per share are disclosed in Note 16 - Income per Share, in the Company's notes to consolidated financial statements on page 106 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K/A.
 
FFO applicable to common shares plus assumed conversions was $750,043,000, or $5.63 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $518,242,000, or $4.44 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $231,801,000 or $1.19 per share.  FFO applicable to common shares plus assumed conversions was $299,441,000 or $2.22 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2004, compared to $130,729,000, or $1.08 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $168,712,000 or $1.14 per share.
 
Included in FFO are certain items that affect comparability as detailed below.  Before these items, the year ended December 31, 2004 is 5.3% higher than the prior year on a per share basis and the three months ended December 31, 2004 is 8.8% higher than the prior year's quarter on a per share basis.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
2.
    
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vornado Realty Trust and its majority-owned subsidiary, Vornado Realty L.P.  All significant intercompany amounts have been eliminated.  The Company accounts for its unconsolidated partially-owned entities on the equity method of accounting.  See below for further details of the Company's accounting policies regarding partially-owned entities.
Basis of Presentation: 
 
The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
 
  Certain prior year balances have been reclassified in order to conform to current year presentation.  The Company has also adjusted certain prior year balances to separately present common shares issued to officer's trust.
Reclassifications:
 
Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.  Betterments, major renewals and certain costs directly related to the acquisition, improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.  For redevelopment of existing operating properties, the net book value of the existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for the construction and improvements incurred in connection with the redevelopment are capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the property do not exceed the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property when complete.  If the cost of the redeveloped property, including the undepreciated net book value of the property carried forward, exceeds the estimated fair value of redeveloped property, the excess is charged to expense.  Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the assets' estimated useful lives which range from 7 to 40 years.  Tenant allowances are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which approximates the useful lives of the assets.  Additions to real estate include interest expense capitalized during construction of $8,718,000 and $5,407,000, for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Real Estate: 
 
Upon acquisitions of real estate, the Company assesses the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, and identified intangibles such as above and below market leases and acquired in-place leases and customer relationships) and acquired liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141: Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and allocates purchase price based on these assessments.  The Company assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property.  The Company's properties, including any related intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.
 
The Company considers APB 18: The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, SOP 78-9: Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures, Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") 96-16: Investors Accounting for an Investee When the Investor has the Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Partners have Certain Approval or Veto Rights and FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised 2003): Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities  An Interpretation of ARB No. 51 ("FIN 46R"), to determine the method of accounting for each of its partially-owned entities.  In determining whether the Company has a controlling interest in a partially-owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, it considers factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which it will absorb the majority of the entity's expected losses, if they occur, or receive the majority of the expected residual returns, if they occur, or both.  The Company has concluded that it does not control a partially-owned entity, despite an ownership interest of 50% or greater, if the entity is not considered a variable interest entity and the approval of all of the partners/members is contractually required with respect to major decisions, such as operating and capital budgets, the sale, exchange or other disposition of real property, the hiring of a chief executive officer, the commencement, compromise or settlement of any lawsuit, legal proceeding or arbitration or the placement of new or additional financing secured by assets of the venture.  This is the case with respect to the Company's 80% interest in Starwood Ceruzzi Venture, and 50% interests in Monmouth Mall, MartParc Wells, MartParc Orleans, and 825 Seventh Avenue.
Partially-Owned Entities:
 
 
2.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - continued
Identified Intangible Assets and Goodwill: 
Upon an acquisition of a business the Company records intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill.  The Company amortizes identified intangible assets that are determined to have finite lives which are based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired.  Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value.
 
The excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired (including identified intangible assets) and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.  Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.  An impairment loss for an asset group is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro-rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, unless the fair value of specific components of the reporting group are determinable without undue cost and effort.
 
As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the carrying amounts of the Company's identified intangible assets are $176,122,000 and $130,915,000 and the carrying amounts of goodwill are $10,425,000 and $4,345,000, respectively.  Such amounts are included in "other assets" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  In addition, the Company has $70,264,000 and $48,884,000 of identified intangible liabilities as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, which are included in "deferred credit" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
 
Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002, the Company tested the goodwill related to the Hotel Pennsylvania acquisition and the Temperature Controlled Logistics business for impairment.  As the carrying amounts of the respective goodwill exceeded the fair values, the Company wrote-off all of the goodwill as an impairment loss totaling $30,129,000 and has reflected the write-off as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on the Company's consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2002.
 
  Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents do not include cash escrowed under loan agreements and cash restricted in connection with an officer's deferred compensation payable.
Cash and Cash Equivalents:
 
The Company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreements.  The Company also maintains an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents.  This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements.  Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: 
 
  The Company has classified debt and equity securities which it intends to hold for an indefinite period of time as securities available-for-sale; equity securities it intends to buy and sell on a short term basis as trading securities; and mandatory redeemable preferred stock investments as securities held to maturity.  Unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings.  Unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale are included as a component of shareholders' equity and other comprehensive income.  Realized gains or losses on the sale of securities are recorded based on specific identification.  A portion of the Company's preferred stock investments are accounted for in accordance with EITF 99-20: Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets.  Income is recognized by applying the prospective method of adjusting the yield to maturity based on an estimate of future cash flows.  If the value of the investment based on the present value of the future cash flows is less than the Company's carrying amount, the investments will be written-down to fair value through earnings.  Investments in securities of non-publicly traded companies are reported at cost, as they are not considered marketable under SFAS No. 115: Accounting For Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.
Marketable Securities:
 
At December 31, 2004 and 2003, marketable securities had an aggregate cost of $135,382,000 and $75,114,000 and an aggregate fair value of $185,394,000 and $81,491,000 (of which $0 represents trading securities; $178,999,000 and $43,527,000 represents securities available for sale; and $6,395,000 and $37,964,000 represent securities held to maturity).  Unrealized gains and losses were $50,012,000 and $0 at December 31, 2004 and $6,377,000 and $0 at December 31, 2003.
 
2.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - - continued
The Company's policy is to record notes and mortgage loans receivable at the stated principal amount less any discount or premium.  The Company accretes or amortizes any discounts or premiums over the life of the related loan receivable utilizing the straight-line method which approximates the effective interest method.  The Company evaluates the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of its loans, if circumstances warrant, to determine whether it is impaired. A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is considered to be impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loan's effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable:
 
Direct financing costs are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related agreements as a component of interest expense. Direct costs related to leasing activities are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases. All other deferred charges are amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method, in accordance with the terms of the agreements to which they relate.
Deferred Charges:
 
The Company has estimated the fair value of all financial instruments reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at amounts which are based upon an interpretation of available market information and valuation methodologies (including discounted cash flow analyses with regard to fixed rate debt).  The fair value of the Company's debt is approximately $256,518,000 and $94,953,000 in excess of the aggregate carrying amounts at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Such fair value estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized upon disposition of the Company's financial instruments.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
 
SFAS No. 133: Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ("SFAS No. 133"), as amended and interpreted, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities.  As required by SFAS No. 133, the Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
Derivative Instruments And Hedging Activities: 
 
For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (loss) (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings.  The Company assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction. For derivatives not designated as hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.
 
2.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - - continued
  The Company has the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:
Revenue Recognition:
 
Base Rents  income arising from tenant leases.  These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases.
 
Percentage Rents  income arising from retail tenant leases which are contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold.  These rents are recognized in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104: Revenue Recognition, which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e. sales thresholds have been achieved).
 
Hotel Revenues  income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue.  Income is recognized when rooms are occupied.  Food and beverage and banquet revenue is recognized when the services have been rendered.
 
Trade Show Revenues  income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths.  This revenue is recognized in accordance with the booth rental contracts when the trade shows have occurred.
 
Expense Reimbursements  revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property.  This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.  Contingent rents are not recognized until realized.
 
Temperature Controlled Logistics revenue  income arising from the Company's investment in Americold.  Storage and handling revenue is recognized as services are provided.  Transportation fees are recognized upon delivery to customers.
 
Management, Leasing and Other Fees  income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially-owned entities.  This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements.
 
The Company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.  The Company will distribute to its shareholders 100% of its taxable income and therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. Dividend distributions for the year ended December 31, 2004 were characterized for Federal income tax purposes as 94.8% ordinary income and 5.2% long-term capital gain income.  Dividend distributions for the year ended December 31, 2003, were characterized for Federal income tax purposes as 94.5% ordinary income and 5.5% long-term capital gain income.  Dividend distributions for the year ended December 31, 2002 were characterized as ordinary income.
Income Taxes:
 
The Company owns stock in corporations that have elected to be treated for Federal income tax purposes, as taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS").  The value of the combined TRS stock cannot and does not exceed 20% of the value of the Company's total assets.  A TRS is taxable on its net income at regular corporate tax rates.  The total income tax paid for the 2004, 2003 and 2002 tax years was $1,867,000, $2,048,000 and $1,430,000.
 
The following table reconciles net income to estimated taxable income for the year ended December 31, 2004.
 
 
The net basis of the Company's assets and liabilities for tax purposes is approximately $3,189,273,000 lower than the amount reported for financial statement purposes.
 
2.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - - continued
  Basic income per share is computed based on weighted average shares outstanding.  Diluted income per share considers the effect of outstanding options, restricted shares, warrants and convertible or redeemable securities.
Income Per Share:
 
  In 2002 and prior years, the Company accounted for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method. Under the intrinsic value method compensation cost is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the Company's stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the option granted. Compensation cost for stock options, if any, is recognized ratably over the vesting period.  The Company's policy is to grant options with an exercise price equal to 100% of the market price of the Company's stock on the grant date. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the Company's stock option grants.  Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123: Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148: Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure.  The Company adopted SFAS No. 123 prospectively by valuing and accounting for employee stock options granted in 2003 and thereafter.  The Company utilizes a binomial valuation model and appropriate market assumptions to determine the value of each grant.  Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for all grants subsequent to 2002.  See Note 10. Stock-Based Compensation, for pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, assuming compensation costs for grants prior to 2003 were recognized as compensation expense based on the fair value at the grant dates.
Stock-Based Compensation:
 
In addition to employee stock option grants, the Company has also granted restricted shares to certain of its employees that vest over a three to five year period.  The Company records the value of each restricted share award as stock-based compensation expense based on the Company's closing stock price on the NYSE on the date of grant on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

Recently Issued Accounting Literature
 
On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153:Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets - An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. The amendments made by SFAS No. 153 are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. Further, the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have "commercial substance." SFAS No. 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 153 on June 15, 2005 will have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123: (Revised 2004) - Share-Based Payment ("SFAS No. 123R").  SFAS 123R replaces SFAS No. 123, which the Company adopted on January 1, 2003. SFAS No. 123R requires that the compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements and be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. SFAS No. 123R is effective as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005.  The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Other Investments:
 
Investment in GMH Communities L.P.
 
On July 20, 2004, the Company committed to make up to a $159,000,000 convertible preferred investment in GMH Communities L.P. ("GMH"), a partnership focused on the student and military housing sectors.  Distributions accrued on the full committed balance of the investment, whether or not drawn, from July 20, 2004, at a rate of 16.27%.  In connection with this commitment, the Company received a placement fee of $3,200,000.  The Company also purchased for $1,000,000, warrants to acquire GMH common equity.  These warrants entitle the Company to acquire (i) 6,666,667 limited partnership units in GMH at an exercise price of $7.50 per unit and (ii) 5,496,724 limited partnership units, through May 6, 2006, at an exercise price of $9.10 per unit.  As of November 3, 2004, the Company had funded a total of $113,777,000 of the commitment.
 
On November 3, 2004, GMH Communities Trust ("GCT") closed its initial public offering ("IPO")  at a price of $12.00 per share.  GCT is a real estate investment trust that conducts its business through GMH, of which it is the sole general partner.  In connection with the IPO, the $113,777,000 previously funded by the Company under the $159,000,000 commitment was repaid, together with accrued distributions of $13,381,000.  The Company also exercised warrants to purchase 6,666,667 limited partnership units at a price of $7.50 per unit, or $50,000,000 in total, which resulted in a gain of $29,500,000.  The Company accounts for its interest in the partnership units on the equity method based on its 12.25% ownership interest and right to appoint one of its executive officers to GCT's Board of Trustees.  The Company records its pro-rata share of GMH's net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis as the Company files its financial statements on Form 10-K or 10-Q prior to the time GMH files its financial statements.
 
Under the warrant agreement, the number of GMH partnership units or GCT common shares underlying the warrants is adjusted for dividends declared by GCT.  On December 16, 2004, GCT declared a dividend of $.16 per common share, which increased the number of shares underlying the warrants from 5,496,724 to 5,563,417 and the exercise price was decreased from $9.10 to $8.99 per share.   Because these warrants are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains and losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the warrants at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in "interest and other investment income" on the Company's consolidated statement of income.  In the quarter ended December 31, 2004, the Company recognized income of $24,190,000 from the mark-to-market of these warrants, which were valued using a trinomial option pricing model based on GCT's closing stock price on the NYSE of $14.10 per share on December 31, 2004.
 
Further, in connection with the IPO, the Company contributed its 90% interest in Campus Club Gainesville, which it acquired in 2000, in exchange for an additional 671,190 GMH limited partnership units.
 
Of the Company's GMH units, 6,666,667 may be converted into an equivalent number of common shares of GCT commencing on May 2, 2005 and 671,190 units may be converted commencing on November 2, 2005.  The Company has agreed not to sell any common shares or units it owns or may acquire until May 2, 2005.
 
Investment in Sears, Roebuck and Co.
 
In July and August 2004, the Company acquired an aggregate of 1,176,600 common shares of Sears, Roebuck and Co. ("Sears") for $41,945,000, an average price of $35.65 per share. Included in the cost is $1,361,000 for a performance-based participation.  These shares are recorded as marketable securities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and are classified as "available for sale."  Appreciation or depreciation in the fair market value of these shares is recorded as an increase or decrease in "accumulated other comprehensive income" in the shareholders' equity section of the Company's consolidated balance sheet and not recognized in income.  At December 31, 2004, based on Sears' closing stock price of $51.03 per share, $18,105,000 of appreciation in the value of these shares was included in "accumulated other comprehensive income."
 
In August and September 2004, the Company acquired an economic interest in an additional 7,916,900 Sears common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which the Company purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on Sears common shares.  These call and put options have an initial weighted-average strike price of $39.82 per share, or an aggregate of $315,250,000, expire in April 2006 and provide for net cash settlement.  Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points and is credited for the dividends received on the shares.  The options provide the Company with the same economic gain or loss as if it had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points.  Because these options are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the options at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in "interest and other investment income" on the Company's consolidated statement of income.  During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded net income of $81,730,000, comprised of (i) $88,782,000 from the mark-to-market of the options on December 31, 2004, based on Sears' closing stock price of $51.03 per share and (ii) $2,295,000 for accrued dividends, partially offset by (i) $5,972,000 for a performance-based participation, (ii) $2,371,000 for the increase in strike price resulting from the LIBOR charge and (iii) $1,004,000 of professional fees.
 
On November 16, 2004, Kmart Holding Corporation ("Kmart") and Sears entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger.  Upon the effective date of the merger, each share of Sears common stock will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder, (i) $50.00 in cash or (ii) 0.50 shares of common stock of the merged company, subject to proration so that 55% of the Sears shares are exchanged for shares of the merged company.
 
Based on Sears' most recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company's aggregate investment in Sears represents 4.2% of Sears' outstanding common shares.

Primestone Settlement of Guarantees (2003) and Foreclosure and Impairment Losses (2002)
 
On September 28, 2000, the Company made a $62,000,000 loan to Primestone Investment Partners, L.P. ("Primestone").  The loan bore interest at 16% per annum.  Primestone defaulted on the repayment of this loan on October 25, 2001.  The loan was subordinate to $37,957,000 of other debt of the borrower that liened the Company's collateral.  On October 31, 2001, the Company purchased the other debt for its face amount.  The loans were secured by 7,944,893 partnership units in Prime Group Realty, L.P., the operating partnership of Prime Group Realty Trust (NYSE:PGE) and the partnership units were exchangeable for the same number of common shares of PGE.  The loans were also guaranteed by affiliates of Primestone.
 
On November 19, 2001, the Company sold, pursuant to a participation agreement with a subsidiary of Cadim inc. ("Cadim"), a Canadian pension fund, a 50% participation in both loans at par for approximately $50,000,000 reducing the Company's net investment in the loans at December 31, 2001 to $56,768,000 including unpaid interest and fees of $6,790,000.  The participation did not meet the criteria for "sale accounting" under SFAS 140 because Cadim was not free to pledge or exchange the assets.
 
On April 30, 2002, the Company and Cadim acquired the 7,944,893 partnership units at a foreclosure auction.  The price paid for the units by application of a portion of Primestone's indebtedness to the Company and Cadim was $8.35 per unit, the April 30, 2002 closing price of shares of PGE on the New York Stock Exchange.  On June 28, 2002, pursuant to the terms of the participation agreement, the Company transferred 3,972,447 of the partnership units to Cadim.
 
st the carrying amount of the Prime Group units to $4.61 per unit, the closing price of PGE shares on December 31, 2002 on the New York Stock Exchange and (ii) $1,000,000 for estimated costs to realize the value of the guarantees.  The Company considered the decline in the value of the units which are convertible into stock to be other than temporary as of December 31, 2002, based on the fact that the market value of the units which are convertible into stock had been less than its cost for more than six months, the severity of the decline, market trends, the financial condition and near-term prospects of Prime Group and other relevant factors.
In the second quarter of 2002, in accordance with foreclosure accounting, the Company recorded a loss on the Primestone foreclosure of $17,671,000 calculated based on (i) the acquisition price of the units and (ii) its valuation of the amounts realizable under the guarantees by affiliates of Primestone, as compared with the net carrying amount of the investment at April 30, 2002.  In the third quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a $2,229,000 write-down on its investment based on costs expended to realize the value of the guarantees.  Further, in the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a $15,857,000 write-down of its investment in Prime Group consisting of (i) $14,857,000 to adj

On June 11, 2003, the Company exercised its right to exchange the 3,972,447 units it owned in Prime Group Realty L.P. for 3,972,447 common shares in Prime Group Realty Trust (NYSE:PGE).  Prior to the exchange, the Company accounted for its investment in the partnership on the equity method.  Subsequent to the exchange, the Company is accounting for its investment in PGE as a marketable equity security-available for sale, as the Company's shares represent less than a 20% ownership interest in PGE (which is not a partnership), the Company does not have significant influence and the common shares have a readily determinable fair value.  Accordingly, the carrying amount previously included in Investments and Advances to Partially-Owned Entities was reclassified to Marketable Securities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.  The Company is also required to mark these securities to market based on the closing price of the PGE shares on the NYSE at the end of each reporting period.  For the period from June 11, 2003 through December 31, 2003, the Company recorded a $6,623,000 unrealized gain, which is not included in the Company's net income, but is reflected as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Shareholders' Equity section of the consolidated balance sheet.  From the date of exchange, income recognition is limited to dividends received on the PGE shares.
 
On June 13, 2003, the Company received its $5,000,000 share of a settlement with affiliates of Primestone Investment Partners of the amounts due under the guarantees of the Primestone loans.  In connection therewith, the Company recognized a $1,388,000 loss on settlement of the guarantees.

Gain on Transfer of Mortgages
 
In the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded a net gain of approximately $2.1 million resulting from payments to the Company by third parties that assumed certain of the Company's mortgages.  Under these transactions the Company paid to the third parties that assumed the Company's obligations the outstanding amounts due under the mortgages and the third parties paid the Company for the benefit of assuming the mortgages.  The Company has been released by the creditors underlying these loans.
 
Net Gain on Sale of Air Rights
 
In 2002, the Company constructed a $16.3 million community facility and low-income residential housing development (the "30th Street Venture"), in order to receive 163,728 square feet of transferable development rights, generally referred to as "air rights".  The Company donated the building to a charitable organization.  The Company sold 106,796 square feet of these air rights to third parties at an average price of $120 per square foot.  An additional 28,821 square feet of air rights was sold to Alexander's at a price of $120 per square foot for use at Alexander's 731 Lexington Avenue project.  In each case, the Company received cash in exchange for air rights.  The Company identified third party buyers for the remaining 28,111 square feet of air rights of the 30th Street Venture.  These third party buyers wanted to use the air rights for the development of two projects located in the general area of 86th Street which was not within the required geographical radius of the construction site nor in the same Community Board as the low-income housing and community facility project.  The 30th Street Venture asked Alexander's to sell 28,111 square feet of the air rights it already owned to the third party buyers (who could use them) and the 30th Street Venture would replace them with 28,111 square feet of air rights.  In October 2002, the Company sold 28,111 square feet of air rights to Alexander's for an aggregate sales price of $3,059,000 (an average of $109 per square foot).   Alexander's then sold an equal amount of air rights to the third party buyers for an aggregate sales price of $3,339,000 (an average of $119 per square foot).
 
Net Gains on Sale of Residential Condominium Units
 
The Company recognized net gains of $776,000, $282,000 and $2,156,000 during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, from the sale of residential condominiums.

During 2004, the Company classified Arlington Plaza, an office property located in Arlington, Virginia as a discontinued operation in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144 and reported revenues and expenses related to the property as discontinued operations and classified the related assets and liabilities held for sale for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  On June 30, 2005, the Company made a decision not to sell Arlington Plaza and accordingly, reclassified the related assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses as continuing operations for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 
SFAS No. 144 requires discontinued operations presentation for disposals of a "component" of an entity.  In accordance with SFAS No. 144, for all periods presented, the Company reclassified its consolidated statements of income to reflect income and expenses for properties which became held for sale subsequent to December 31, 2001, as discontinued operations and reclassified its consolidated balance sheets to reflect assets and liabilities related to such properties as assets related to discontinued operations and liabilities related to discontinued operations.
 
Assets related to discontinued operations consist primarily of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation.  The following table sets forth the balances of the assets related to discontinued operations as of December 31, 2004 and 2003:
 
 
The following table sets forth the balances of the liabilities related to discontinued operations (primarily mortgage notes payable) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company owns 7.3 million limited partnership units, or 12.25% of the limited partnership interest of GMH, a partnership focused on the student and military housing sectors.  Details of this investment are provided on page 76.  The Company accounts for its interest in the partnership units on the equity-method based on its 12.25% ownership interest and right to appoint one of its executive officers to GCT's Board of Trustees.  The Company records its prorata share of GMH's net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis as the Company files its financial statements on Form 10-K or 10-Q prior to the time GMH files its financial statements.  GMH's properties were 94.2% occupied as of December 31, 2004.  GMH's outstanding indebtedness was $359,000 as of December 31, 2004, of which the Company's share was $44,000.
 
In addition, the Company holds warrants to purchase an additional 5.6 million limited partnership units of GMH or common shares of GCT at a price of $8.99 per unit or share through May 6, 2006.  Because these warrants are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the warrants at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in "interest and other investment income" on the Company's consolidated statement of income.  In the quarter ended December 31, 2004, the Company recognized $24,190 from the mark-to-market of these warrants, which were valued using trinomial option pricing model based on GCT's closing stock price on the NYSE of $14.10 per share on December 31, 2004.

The Company owns 33% of the outstanding common stock of Alexander's at December 31, 2004 and 2003.   The Company manages, leases and develops Alexander's properties pursuant to agreements (see below) which expire in March of each year and are automatically renewable, except for the 731 Lexington Avenue development agreement which provides for a term lasting until substantial completion of the development of the property.
 
Management and Leasing Agreements
 
The Company receives an annual fee for managing all of Alexander's properties equal to the sum of (i) $3,000,000, (ii) 3% of the gross income from the Kings Plaza Mall, and (iii) 6% of development costs with minimum guaranteed fees of $750,000 per annum.
 
The Company generally receives a fee of (i) 3% of lease rent for the first ten years of a lease term, 2% of lease rent for the 11th through the 20th years of a lease term and 1% of lease rent for the 21st through 30th years of a lease term, subject to the payment of rents by Alexander's tenants and (ii) 3% of asset sales proceeds. Such amounts are payable to the Company annually in an amount not to exceed an aggregate of $2,500,000 until the present value of such installments (calculated at a discount rate of 9% per annum) equals the amount that would have been paid at the time the transactions which gave rise to the commissions occurred.
 
The Company recognized $7,800,000, $4,339,000 and $4,781,000 of fee income under these agreements during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  At December 31, 2004, and 2003, $23,744,000 and $14,450,000 was due to the Company under these agreements.
 
731 Lexington Avenue and Other Fees
 
The Company guaranteed to Alexander's 731 Lexington Avenue construction lender, the lien free, timely completion of the construction of the project and funding of project costs in excess of a stated budget, if not funded by Alexander's for which the Company is entitled to a $6,300,000 estimated fee based on 1% of construction costs, as defined, payable upon the completion of construction.  Based upon the current status of construction, management does not anticipate the need to fund pursuant to this completion guarantee.  The Company has recognized $3,777,000, $6,935,000 and $6,915,000 as development and guarantee fee income during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

In October 2004, Alexander's also contracted with BMS to provide the same services at the Kings Plaza Regional Shopping Center on the same terms.  On May 27, 2004, the Company entered into an agreement with Alexander's under which it provides property management services at 731 Lexington Avenue for an annual fee of $0.50 per square foot of the tenant-occupied office and retail space.

Debt Agreements
 
At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company has loans receivable from Alexander's of $124,000,000, including $29,000,000 drawn under a $50,000,000 line of credit.  The maturity date of the loans is the earlier of January 3, 2006 or the date the Alexander's Lexington Avenue construction loan is finally repaid.  Effective April 1, 2004, based on Alexander's improved liquidity, the Company modified its term loan and line of credit to Alexander's to reduce the spread on the interest rate it charges from 9.48% to 6%.  Accordingly, the current interest rate was reduced from 12.48% to 9%.
 
On February 13, 2004, Alexander's completed a $400,000,000 mortgage financing on the office space of its Lexington Avenue development project.  The loan bears interest at 5.33%, matures in February 2014 and beginning in the third year, provides for principal payments based on a 25-year amortization schedule such that over the remaining eight years of the loan, ten years of amortization will be paid.  Of the loan proceeds, $253,529,000 was used to repay the entire amount outstanding under the construction loan.  The construction loan was modified so that the remaining availability is $237,000,000, which was approximately the amount estimated to complete the Lexington Avenue development project.  The interest rate on the construction loan is LIBOR plus 2.5% (4.92% at December 31, 2004) and matures in January 2006, with two one-year extensions.  The collateral for the construction loan is the same, except that the office space has been removed from the lien.  Further, the construction loan permits the release of the retail space for a payment of $15,000,000 and requires all proceeds from the sale of the residential condominium units to be applied to the construction loan balance until it is finally repaid.
 
Temperature Controlled Logistics
 
On February 5, 2004, Americold Realty Trust ("Americold") completed a $254,400,000 mortgage financing for 21 of its owned and 7 of its leased temperature-controlled warehouses.  The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.95% (with a LIBOR floor of 1.5% with respect to $54,400,000 of the loan) and requires principal payments of $5,000,000 annually.  The loan matures in April 2009 and is pre-payable without penalty after February 5, 2006.  The net proceeds were approximately $225,000,000 after providing for usual escrows, closing costs and the repayment of $12,900,000 of existing mortgages on two of the warehouses, of which $135,000,000 was distributed to the Company and the remainder was distributed to its partner.
 
Prior to November 18, 2004, the Company owned a 60% interest in Vornado Crescent Portland Partnership ("VCPP") which owned Americold.  Americold owns 88 temperature controlled warehouses, all of which were leased to AmeriCold Logistics.  On November 4, 2004, Americold purchased its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, for $47,700,000 in cash.  On November 18, 2004, the Company and its 40% partner, Crescent Real Estate Equities Company ("CEI") collectively sold 20.7% of Americold's common shares to The Yucaipa Companies ("Yucaipa") for $145,000,000, which resulted in a gain, of which the Company's share was $18,789,000. The sale price was based on a $1.450 billion valuation for Americold before debt and other obligations.  Yucaipa is a private equity firm with significant expertise in the food distribution, logistics and retail industries.  Upon closing of the sale to Yucaipa on November 18, 2004, Americold is owned 47.6% by the Company, 31.7% by CEI and 20.7% by Yucaipa. Pursuant to the sales agreement: (i) Yucaipa may earn a promote of 20% of the increase in the value of Americold through December 31, 2007, limited to 10% of the Company's and CEI's remaining interest in Americold; (ii) the annual asset management fee payable by CEI to the Company has been reduced from approximately $5,500,000 to $4,548,000, payable quarterly through October 30, 2027.  CEI, at its option, may terminate the payment of this fee at any time after November 2009, by paying the Company a termination fee equal to the present value of the remaining payments through October 30, 2027, discounted at 10%.  In addition, CEI is obligated to pay a pro rata portion of the termination fee to the extent it sells a portion of its equity interest in Americold; and (iii) VCPP was dissolved.  The Company has the right to appoint three of the five members to Americold's Board of Trustees.  Consequently, the Company is deemed to exercise control over Americold and, on November 18, 2004, the Company began to consolidate the operations and financial position of Americold into its accounts and no longer accounts for its investment on the equity method.

On February 5, 2004, the Company completed a $300,000 refinancing of Two Penn Plaza.  The loan bears interest at 4.97% and matures in February 2011.  The Company retained net proceeds of $39,000 after repaying the existing $151,000 loan, $75,000 of the $275,000 mortgage loan on its One Penn Plaza property and the $33,000 mortgage loan on 866 U.N. Plaza.  On November 15, 2004, the Company completed a $220,000,000 refinancing of Eleven Penn Plaza.  This loan bears interest at 5.20% and matures on December 1, 2014.  Of the loan proceeds, $200,000,000 was used to repay the remainder of the loan on One Penn Plaza.

On June 9, 2003, the Company completed a $170,000 financing of its 770 Broadway property.  The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.05% is pre-payable after one year without penalty and matures in June 2006 with two-one year extension options.  The proceeds of the new loan were used primarily to repay (i) a $18,926 mortgage loan on 33 North Dearborn, (ii) a $69,507 mortgage loan on Tysons Dulles Plaza, and (iii) $40,000 of borrowing under the Company's unsecured revolving credit facility.  In connection with the closing of the 770 Broadway loan, the Company purchased an interest rate cap, and simultaneously sold an interest rate cap with the same terms.  Since these instruments do not reduce the Company's net interest rate risk exposure, they do not qualify as hedges and changes in their respective values are charged to earnings.  As the significant terms of these arrangements are the same, the effects of a revaluation of these instruments is expected to substantially offset one another.  Simultaneously with the completion of the 770 Broadway loan, the Company used cash from its mortgage escrow account to repay $133,659 of the $153,659 of debt previously cross-collateralized by its 770 Broadway and 595 Madison Avenue properties.

On August 4, 2003, the Company completed a refinancing of its 909 Third Avenue mortgage loan.  The new $125,000 mortgage loan is for a term of three years and bears interest at LIBOR plus .70% and has two one-year extension options.  Simultaneously with the completion of the 909 Third Avenue loan, the Company used cash from its mortgage escrow account to repay the balance of $20,000 of debt previously cross-collateralized by its 770 Broadway and 595 Madison Avenue properties.  In connection with the closing of the 909 Third Avenue loan, the Company purchased an interest rate cap and simultaneously sold an interest rate cap with the same terms.  Since these instruments do not reduce the Company's net interest rate risk exposure, they do not qualify as hedges and changes in their respective values are charged to earnings.

On June 27, 2002, the Company entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the interest rate on the $500,000 senior unsecured notes due 2007 from a fixed rate of 5.625% to a floating rate of LIBOR plus .7725%, based upon the trailing 3 month LIBOR rate (2.57% if set on December 31, 2004).  The swaps were designated and effective as fair value hedges with a fair value of $13,148 and $25,780 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and included in "Other Assets" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.  Accounting for these swaps requires the Company to recognize the changes in the fair value of the debt during each period.  At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the fair value adjustment to the principal amount of the debt was $13,148 and $25,780, based on the fair value of the swap assets, and is included in the balance of the Senior Unsecured Notes.  Because the hedging relationship qualifies for the "short-cut" method, no hedge ineffectiveness on these fair value hedges was recognized in 2004 and 2003.

On August 16, 2004, the Company completed a public offering of $250,000, aggregate principal amount of 4.50% senior unsecured notes due August 15, 2009.

Stock-based Compensation
10.
 
 
The Company's Share Option Plan (the "Plan") provides for grants of incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights and performance shares to certain employees and officers of the Company.
 
Restricted stock awards are granted at the market price on the date of grant and vest over a three to five year period.  The Company recognizes the value of restricted stock as compensation expense based on the Company's closing stock price on the NYSE on the date of grant on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  As of December 31, 2004, there are 290,478 restricted shares outstanding, excluding 626,566 shares issued to the Company's President in connection with his employment agreement.  The Company recognized $4,200,000, $3,239,000 and $914,000 of compensation expense in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, for the portion of these shares that vested during each year.  Dividends paid on both vested and unvested shares are charged directly to retained earnings and amounted to $938,700, $777,700 and $210,100 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Dividends on shares that are cancelled or terminated prior to vesting are charged to compensation expense in the period of the cancellation or termination.
 
Stock options are granted at an exercise price equal to 100% of the market price of the Company's stock on the date of grant, generally vest pro-rata over three to five years and expire 10 years from the date of grant.  As of December 31, 2004 there are 12,882,014 options outstanding.  On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS 123: Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148: Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure, on a prospective basis covering all grants subsequent to 2002.  Under SFAS No. 123, the Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of options granted on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  For the year ended December 31, 2004, and 2003, the Company recognized $102,900 and $77,200 of compensation expense related to the options granted during 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Grants prior to 2003 are accounted for under the intrinsic value method under which compensation expense is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the Company's stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the option granted.  As the Company's policy is to grant options with an exercise price equal to 100% of the quoted market price on the grant date, no compensation expense has been recognized for options granted prior to 2003.  If compensation cost for grants prior to 2003 were recognized as compensation expense based on the fair value at the grant dates, net income and income per share would have been reduced to the pro-forma amounts below:

Stock-based Compensation - continued
 
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using an option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in the periods ending December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.  There were no stock option grants during 2004.  In February 2005, as part of the Company's annual compensation review for 2004, 1,038,800 stock options and 73,216 restricted shares were granted to certain employees.  The stock options were granted at an exercise price equal to 100% of the market price on the date of grant.
 
 
A summary of the Plan's status and changes during the years then ended, is presented below:
 
 
The following table summarizes information about options outstanding under the Plan at December 31, 2004:
 
 
Shares available for future grant under the Plan at December 31, 2004 were 9,955,734, of which 2,500,000 are subject to shareholder approval.
 
Retirement Plans
11.
 
 
The Company has two defined benefit pension plans, a Vornado Realty Trust Retirement Plan ("Vornado Plan") and a Merchandise Mart Properties Pension Plan ("Mart Plan").  In addition, Americold Realty Trust, which is consolidated into the accounts of the Company beginning November 18, 2004, has two defined benefit pension plans (the "AmeriCold Plans" and together with the Vornado Plan and the Mart Plan "the Plans").  The benefits under the Vornado Plan and the Mart Plan were frozen in December 1997 and June 1999, respectively.  Effective April 2005, Americold will amend its Americold Retirement Income Plan to freeze benefits for non-union participants.  Benefits under the Plans are or were primarily based on years of service and compensation during employment or on years of credited service and established monthly benefits.  Funding policy for the Plans is based on contributions at the minimal amounts required by law.  The financial results of the Plans are consolidated in the information provided below.
 
The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for the Vornado Plan, the Mart Plan and the Americold plans.

Retirement Plans - continued
 
 
The Company periodically reviews its assumptions for the rate of return on each Plan's assets.  The assumptions are based primarily on the long-term historical performance of the assets of the Plans, future expectations for returns for each asset class as well as target asset allocation of Plan assets.  Differences in the rates of return in the near term are recognized as gains or losses in the periods that they occur.
 
Plan Assets
 
The Company has consistently applied what it believes to be a conservative investment strategy for the Vornado Plan, investing primarily in cash and cash equivalents and fixed income funds, including money market funds, United States treasury bills, government bonds and mortgage back securities.  Vornado Plan's weighted-average asset allocations by asset category are as follows:

The Americold Plans are invested to maximize return on the Plans' assets while minimizing risk by diversifying across a broad range of asset classes.  In accordance with the Plans' investment strategies, assets are invested domestic equities, hedge funds, and fixed income securities.
 
The allocations of Americold Plan investments by fair value for the year ended December 31, 2004, are as follows:

The Company expects to contribute $8,448,000 to the Plans in 2005.
 
Estimated Future Benefit Payments
 
The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:
 
Leases
12.
 
 
As lessor:
 
The Company leases space to tenants under operating leases. Most of the leases provide for the payment of fixed base rentals payable monthly in advance. Shopping center leases provide for the pass-through to tenants of real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance. Office building leases generally require the tenants to reimburse the Company for operating costs and real estate taxes above their base year costs. Shopping center leases also provide for the payment by the lessee of additional rent based on a percentage of the tenants' sales. As of December 31, 2004, future base rental revenue under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding rents for leases with an original term of less than one year and rents resulting from the exercise of renewal options, is as follows:
 
 
These amounts do not include rentals based on tenants' sales.  These percentage rents approximated $5,563,000, $3,662,000, and $1,832,000, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002.
 
Except for the U.S. Government, which accounted for 12.5% of the Company's revenue, none of the Company's tenants represented more than 10% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004.
 
Former Bradlees Locations
 
Pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, dated May 1, 1992, the Company is due $5,000,000 per annum of additional rent from Stop & Shop which was allocated to certain of Bradlees former locations.  In December 31, 2002, prior to the expiration of the leases to which the additional rent was allocated, the Company reallocated this rent to other former Bradlees leases also guaranteed by Stop & Shop.  Stop & Shop is contesting the Company's right to reallocate and claims the Company is no longer entitled to the additional rent.  At December 31, 2004, the Company is due an aggregate of $10,497,000.  The Company believes the additional rent provision of the guaranty expires at the earliest in 2012 and is vigorously contesting Stop & Shop's position.

Leases - - continued
 
 
As lessee:
 
The Company is a tenant under operating leases for certain properties. These leases have terms that expire during the next thirty years.  Future minimum lease payments under operating leases at December 31, 2004, are as follows:
 
 
Rent expense was $21,334,000, $15,593,000, and $17,157,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002.
 
The Company is also a lessee under capital leases for equipment and real estate (primarily Americold).  Lease terms generally range from 5-20 years with renewal or purchase options.  Capitalized leases are recorded at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the property.  Capitalized leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the asset or life of the related lease, whichever is shorter.  Amortization expense on capital leases is included in "depreciation and amortization" on the Company's consolidated statements of income.  As of December 31, 2004, future minimum lease payments under capital leases are as follows:
 
 
At December 31, 2004 and 2003, $54,261,000 and $6,920,000 representing the present value of net minimum payments is included in "Other Liabilities" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  At December 31, 2004 and 2003, property leased under capital leases had a total cost of $64,974,000 and $6,184,000 and related accumulated depreciation of $11,495,000 and $940,000, respectively.

In conjunction with the closing of Alexander's Lexington Avenue construction loan on July 3, 2002, the Company agreed to guarantee to the construction lender, the lien free, timely completion of the construction of the project and funding of all project costs in excess of a stated budget, as defined in the loan agreement, if not funded by Alexander's (see Note 5  Investments in Partially-Owned Entities).
 
Each of the Company's properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to the Company.
 
The Company carries comprehensive liability and all risk property insurance ((i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended coverage, (iv) "acts of terrorism" as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 which expires in 2005 and (v) rental loss insurance) with respect to its assets.  In April 2004, the Company renewed its all risk policies and increased its coverage for Acts of Terrorism for each of its New York Office, CESCR Office, Retail and Merchandise Mart divisions.  Below is a summary of the current all risk property insurance and terrorism risk insurance for each of the Company's business segments:

Limited as to terrorism insurance by the sub-limit shown in the adjacent column.
 
In addition to the coverage above, the Company carries lesser amounts of coverage for terrorist acts not covered by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002.
 
The Company's debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by its properties (which are generally non-recourse to the Company), its senior unsecured notes due 2007, 2009 and 2010 and its revolving credit agreement, contain customary covenants requiring the Company to maintain insurance.  Although the Company believes that it has adequate insurance coverage under these agreements, the Company may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future.  Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than the Company is able to obtain, or if the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 is not extended, it could adversely affect the Company's ability to finance and/or refinance its properties and expand its portfolio.
 
From time to time, the Company has disposed of substantial amounts of real estate to third parties for which, as to certain properties, it remains contingently liable for rent payments or mortgage indebtedness that cannot be quantified by the Company.
 
There are various legal actions against the Company in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.
 
The Company enters into agreements for the purchase and resale of U.S. government obligations for periods of up to one week. The obligations purchased under these agreements are held in safekeeping in the name of the Company by various money center banks. The Company has the right to demand additional collateral or return of these invested funds at any time the collateral value is less than 102% of the invested funds plus any accrued earnings thereon.  The Company had $23,110,000 and $30,310,000 of cash invested in these agreements at December 31, 2004 and 2003.

Loan and Compensation Agreements
 
In accordance with the terms of the employment arrangement with Steven Roth, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, and subject to a letter agreement dated November 1999, Mr. Roth may draw up to $15,000,000 of loans on a revolving basis.  Each loan bears interest, payable quarterly, at the applicable Federal rate on the date the loan is made and matures on the sixth anniversary of such loan.  Loans are collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the amount outstanding.  At December 31, 2004, the outstanding balance under this arrangement was $13,122,500 (of which $4,704,500 is shown as a reduction in shareholders' equity).  The amount outstanding matures in January 2006 and bears interest at a weighted average rate of 4.49% per annum.
 
At December 31, 2004, the balance of the loan due from Michael Fascitelli, the Company's President, in accordance with his employment agreement was $8,600,000.  The loan matures in December 2006 and bears interest, payable quarterly, at a weighted average rate of 3.97% (based on the applicable Federal rate).
 
Effective January 1, 2002, the Company extended its employment agreement with Mr. Fascitelli for a five-year period through December 31, 2006.  Pursuant to the extended employment agreement, Mr. Fascitelli is entitled to receive a deferred payment on December 31, 2006 of 626,566 Vornado common shares which are valued for compensation purposes at $27,500,000 (the value of the shares on March 8, 2002, the date the extended employment agreement was executed).  The shares are held in a rabbi trust for the benefit of Mr. Fascitelli and vested 100% on December 31, 2002.  The extended employment agreement does not permit diversification, allows settlement of the deferred compensation obligation by delivery of these shares only, and permits the deferred delivery of these shares.  The value of these shares was amortized ratably over the one-year vesting period as compensation expense.  The assets of the rabbi trust are consolidated with those of the Company and the Company's common shares held in the trust are classified in shareholders' equity and accounted for in a manner similar to treasury stock.
 
Pursuant to the Company's annual compensation review in February 2002 with Joseph Macnow, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, the Compensation Committee approved a $2,000,000 loan to Mr. Macnow, bearing interest at the applicable Federal rate of 4.65% per annum and due in June 2007.  The loan was funded on July 23, 2002 and is collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the loan amount.
 
On March 11, 2004, the Company loaned $2,000,000 to Melvyn Blum, an executive officer of the Company, pursuant to the revolving credit facility contained in his January 2000 employment agreement.  The loan bears interest at 1.57% per annum (the Federal rate) and is due in March 2007.
 
On February 22, 2005, the Company and Sandeep Mathrani, Executive Vice President  Retail Division, entered into a new employment agreement.  Pursuant to the agreement, the Company granted Mr. Mathrani (i) 16,836 restricted shares of the Company's stock, (ii) stock options to acquire 300,000 of the Company's common shares at an exercise price of $71.275 per share and (iii) the right to receive 200,000 stock options over the next two years at the then prevailing market price.  In addition, Mr. Mathrani repaid the $500,000 loan the Company provided him under his prior employment agreement.

Alexander's
 
The Company owns 33% of Alexander's.  Mr. Roth and Mr. Fascitelli are Officers and Directors of Alexander's.  The Company provides various services to Alexander's in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements and the Company has made loans to Alexander's aggregating $124,000,000 at December 31, 2004.  See Note 5  Investments in Partially-Owned Entities for details of these agreements.  In addition, in 2002, the Company sold air rights to Alexander's, details of which are provided in Note 3  Acquisitions and Dispositions.
 
Interstate Properties
 
As of December 31, 2004, Interstate Properties and its partners owned approximately 10.8% of the common shares of beneficial interest of the Company and 27.4% of Alexander's common stock.  Interstate Properties is a general partnership in which Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the partners.  Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the managing general partner of Interstate Properties, and the Chief Executive Officer and a director of Alexander's.  Messrs. Mandelbaum and Wight are trustees of the Company and also directors of Alexander's.
 
The Company manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate Properties pursuant to a management agreement for which the Company receives an annual fee equal to 4% of base rent and percentage rent.  The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days' notice at the end of the term. Although the management agreement was not negotiated at arm's length, the Company believes based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies that its terms are fair to the Company. The Company earned $726,000, $703,000 and $747,000 of management fees under the management agreement for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002.  In addition, during fiscal years 2003 and 2002, as a result of a previously existing leasing arrangement with Alexander's, Alexander's paid to Interstate $587,000 and $703,000, respectively, for the leasing an other services actually rendered by the Company.  Upon receipt of these payments, Interstate promptly paid them over to the Company without retaining any interest therein.  This arrangement was terminated at the end of 2003 and all payments by Alexander's thereafter for these leasing and other services are made directly to the Company.
 
Vornado Operating Company ("Vornado Operating")
 
In October 1998, Vornado Operating was spun off from the Company in order to own assets that the Company could not itself own and conduct activities that the Company could not itself conduct.  Vornado Operating's primary asset was its 60% investment in AmeriCold Logistics, which leased 88 refrigerated warehouses from Americold, owned 60% by the Company.  The Company granted Vornado Operating a $75,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility that was to expire on December 31, 2004.  Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bore interest at LIBOR plus 3%.  The Company received a commitment fee equal to 1% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the facility.  At the time of its dissolution referred to below, Vornado Operating had outstanding 4,068,924 shares and its operating partnership had outstanding 447,017 units.  At such time, trustees and officers of the Company held approximately 24.3% of the common shares and units of Vornado Operating.  In addition, Messrs. Roth, Fascitelli, Macnow, Wight and West each served as an officer and/or director of Vornado Operating.
 
On December 31, 2002, the Company and Crescent Real Estate Equities formed a joint venture to acquire the Carthage, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas quarries from AmeriCold Logistics for $20,000,000 in cash (appraised value).  The Company contributed cash of $8,800,000 to the joint venture representing its 44% interest.  AmeriCold Logistics used the proceeds from the sale to repay a portion of a loan to Vornado Operating.  Vornado Operating then repaid $9,500,000 of the amount outstanding under the Company's revolving credit facility.   In addition, during 2004 and 2003, this joint venture acquired $21,930,000 and $5,720,000 of trade receivables from AmeriCold Logistics for $21,500,000 and $5,606,000, respectively.  These receivables were subsequently collected in full.
 
On November 4, 2004, Americold purchased its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, for $47,700,000 in cash.  As part of this transaction, Vornado Operating repaid the $21,989,000 balance of the loan to the Company as well as $4,771,000 of unpaid interest.  Because the Company fully reserved for the interest income on this loan beginning in January 2002, it recognized $4,771,000 of income upon collection in the fourth quarter 2004.

further but limited information before holding an additional hearing regarding the settlement, which has been scheduled for March 2005.  The Company has accrued the proposed settlement payment and related legal costs as part of "general and administrative expense" in the fourth quarter of 2004.  The Company believes that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
In November 2004, a class action shareholder derivative lawsuit was brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Vornado Operating Company, its directors and the Company.  The lawsuit sought to enjoin the dissolution of Vornado Operating, rescind the previously completed sale of AmeriCold Logistics (owned 60% by Vornado Operating) to Americold Realty Trust (owned 60% by the Company) and damages.  In addition, the plaintiffs claimed that the Vornado Operating directors breached their fiduciary duties.  On November 24, 2004, a stipulation of settlement was entered into under which the Company agreed to settle the lawsuit with a payment of approximately $4.5 million or about $1 per Vornado Operating share or partnership unit before litigation expenses. The proposed settlement payment would be in addition to the liquidation distribution of $2 per Vornado Operating share or unit that Vornado Operating made to its equity-holders when it dissolved on December 29, 2004.  On January 20, 2005, the Delaware Court of Chancery postponed deciding upon the proposed settlement and requested

Greenbaum, an executive officer of the Company.  The Company paid BMS $53,024,000, for the year ended December 31, 2002 for services rendered to the Company's Manhattan office properties.  Although the terms and conditions of the contracts pursuant to which these services were provided were not negotiated at arms length, the Company believes based upon comparable amounts charged to other real estate companies that the terms and conditions of the contracts were fair to the Company.
 
On August 4, 2003, the Company completed the acquisition of 2101 L Street, a 370,000 square foot office building located in Washington D.C.

On July 1, 2003, upon the adoption of SFAS No. 150: Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity, the Company was required to include the liquidation value of these F-1 preferred units as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet as opposed to their prior classification as minority interest because of the possible settlement of this obligation by issuing a variable number of the Company's common shares.  In addition, after July 1, 2003, distributions to the holders of the F-1 preferred units are included as a component of interest expense as opposed to their prior classification as minority interest expense.
  
(4)
Convertible at the option of the holder for an equivalent amount of the Company's preferred shares and redeemable at the Company's option after the 5th anniversary of the date of issuance (ranging from September 2004 to December 2009).

On February 3, 2005, the Company supplied $135,000,000 of financing to Riley Holdco Corp, an entity formed to complete the acquisition of LNR Property Corporation (NYSE:LNR).  Riley Holdco Corp. is a wholly owned subsidiary of LNR Property Holdings, Ltd., which is 75% owned by funds and accounts managed by Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. and its real estate affiliate Blackacre Institutional Capital Management, LLC.  The terms of the financings are as follows:  (i) $60,000,000 of a $325,000,000 mezzanine tranche of a $2.4 billion credit facility which is secured by certain equity interests.  This tranche is junior to $1.9 billion of the credit facility, bears interest at LIBOR plus 5.25%, and matures in February 2008 with two one-year extensions; and (ii) $75,000,000 of $400,000,000 of unsecured notes which are subordinate to the $2.4 billion credit facility and senior to over $700,000,000 of equity contributed to finance the acquisition.  These notes mature in February 2015, provide for a 1.5% placement fee, and bear interest at 10% for the first five years and 11% for years six through ten.
 
On February 4, 2005, the Company acquired from JER Investors Trust a $17,000,000 participation in a $34,000,000 mezzanine loan secured by Roney Palace Phase II, in Miami Beach, Florida, a 593-room hotel to be converted to residential condominiums.  The loan, which is subordinate to $141,000,000 of other debt, bears interest at LIBOR plus 9.53%, until 25% of the loan is repaid and LIBOR plus 7.48% thereafter until maturity in October 2006.  The loan has a one-year extension option.
 
Restatement
21.
      
 
Subsequent to the issuance of the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004, management determined that the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 should be restated to reclassify $16,740,000, $6,666,000 and $65,197,000, respectively, from "net cash used in investing activities" to "net cash provided by operating activities" as they relate to distributions of income received from investments in partially-owned entities accounted for on the equity method.  The restatement does not affect the total net change in cash and cash equivalents for each of the three years ended December 31, 2004, and has no impact on the Company's consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of income or the related income per share amounts.
