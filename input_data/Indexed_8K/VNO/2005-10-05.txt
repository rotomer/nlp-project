On July 21, 2005, Vornado Realty Trust and other investors acquired Toys "R" Us, Inc. ("Toys") and in connection with that acquisition we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K describing the acquisition.  Reference is made to that Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Vornado with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated July 21, 2005, in connection with the merger between Global Toys Acquisition Merger Sub, Inc. ("Purchaser") with and into Toys pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 17, 2005, among Toys, Global Toys Acquisition LLC and Purchaser (the "Merger Agreement").  This Current Report on Form 8-K/A amends that prior filing.  In connection with the merger:
 
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vornado Realty L.P., the operating partnership of Vornado, paid $407,342,687 and turned in 784,700 shares of Toys common stock, with a market value of $20,990,725, that it already owned in Toys in return for an approximately 32.9% interest in the equity of Toys that we own through our 32.9% interest in Toys "R" Us Holdings, Inc., which owns all of the outstanding common shares of Toys; and
 - 
                 
 
the publicly held shares of Toys common stock were converted into the right to receive $26.75 per share, representing an aggregate purchase price of $6.6 billion.
 - 
                 
 
Exhibit 99.1 presents the audited consolidated historical financial statements of Toys for its fiscal year ended January 29, 2005, its last completed fiscal year, and Exhibit 99.2 presents the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Toys for the 26 weeks ended July 30, 2005, its most recently completed six month fiscal period. Exhibit 99.3 presents the Company's unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, its last completed fiscal year, and for the six months ended June 30, 2005, its most recently completed six month fiscal period, with pro forma adjustments arising from Toys' fiscal year ended January 29, 2005 and Toys' 26 weeks ended July 30, 2005.  Exhibit 99.4 presents Toys pro forma unaudited condensed consolidated financial
Attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2 and 99.3 and incorporated by reference herein are the required audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and pro forma financial information, respectively. 
statements as prepared by Toys for its fiscal year ended January 29, 2005 and the 26 weeks ended July 30, 2005.
 
The business of Toys is highly seasonal.  Based on Toys' annual report for the year ended January 29, 2005, the first quarter ended May 1, 2004 and the third quarter ended October 30, 2004 resulted in net losses, and the second quarter ended July 31, 2004 and the fourth quarter ended January 29, 2005 resulted in net income, with the fourth quarter accounting for over 80% of Toys' net income for the year ended January 29, 2005.  Accordingly, the Company's financial statements will be affected by the seasonality of Toys' business.
 
The Company's fiscal year ends on December 31 whereas Toys' fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31, therefore, the Company will record its pro-rata share of Toys' net income (loss) on a one quarter-lag basis.  For example, the Company's financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31 will include Toys' financial results for the third quarter ended October 30, and the Company's financial results for the year ended December 31 will include Toys', financial results for its first, second and third quarters ended October 30, as well as its fourth quarter results of the prior year.  Exhibit 99.5 presents the Company's equity in Toys' unaudited pro forma financial results prepared on a one-quarter lag basis for the third and fourth quarters of 2004 and the first and second quarters of 2005.

Exhibit 99.3
 
VORNADO REALTY TRUST
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 
The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information presents (i) the Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of Vornado Realty Trust (the "Company") as of June 30, 2005, as if the acquisition of Toys "R" Us, Inc. ("Toys") had occurred on June 30, 2005, and (ii) the Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income of the Company for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2005 and for the Year Ended December 31, 2004, as if the acquisition, including acquisition debt and purchase price accounting, had occurred on January 1, 2004.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements are presented for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what the Company's actual results of operations or financial position would have been had this acquisition been consummated on the dates indicated, nor does it purport to represent the Company's results of operations or financial position for any future period.  The pro forma adjustments are based on available information and upon assumptions that management believes are reasonable.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with (i) the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the Year Ended December 31, 2004, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on June 10, 2005, (ii) the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, filed with the SEC on July 29, 2005, (iii) the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2004, included in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on August 19, 2005, (iv) the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Toys as of and for the Year Ended January 29, 2005 which were filed by Toys with the SEC on April 29, 2005 under Part I, Item 8 of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended January 29, 2005, and which are filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on this Form 8-K/A; (v) the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Toys as of and for the 26 weeks ended July 30, 2005, which were filed by Toys with the SEC on September 14, 2005 under Part I, Item 1 of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended July 30, 2005, and which are filed as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form-8K/A; and (vi) the unaudited pro forma condensed financial information of Toys for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2005 and as of and for the 26 weeks ended July 30, 2005, which are attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K/A as Exhibit 99.4.
 
 
 
Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2005:
 
(a)   Reflects the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company as of June 30, 2005.
 
Reflects the cash consideration paid in the acquisition, net of (i) $25.0 million paid to the Company by Toys for an origination fee which was treated as a reduction of the purchase price and (ii) $0.7 million paid to the Company by Toys for an expense reimbursement.
(b)
        
 
Reflects the fair value of Toys stock the Company relinquished in the acquisition.
(c)
         
 
Reflects the elimination of unrealized gains classified within other comprehensive income on the shares of Toys stock owned by the Company and relinquished in the acquisition.
(d)
        
 
Reflects the carrying amout of the Company's investment in Toys as a result of the acquisition.
(e)
         
 
 
 
Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2005:
 
Reflects the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income of the Company for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2005.
(a)
         
 
EBITDA represents "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization". Management considers EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of its segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity.  As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, management utilizes this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of its assets to that of its peers.  EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.
(b)
        
 
Reflects the Company's 32.9% interest in Toys' Net income (loss) for the Quarters Ended April 30, 2005 and July 30, 2005 accounted for under the equity method.  The Company's fiscal year ends on December 31 whereas Toys' fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31, therefore the Company will record its pro-rata share of Toys' Net income (loss) on a one-quarter lag basis.  Accordingly, had the Company owned its portion of Toys on January 1, 2005 the Company would have recorded its pro-rata share of Toys' financial results for their Quarters Ended January 29, 2005 and April 30, 2005 in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income for the Quarters Ended March 31, 2005 and June 30, 2005 and the results would have been significantly different because of Toys' seasonality for the Quarter Ended January 29, 2005 which includes the holiday selling season. See Exhibit 99.5.
(c)
         
 
Reflects the reduction of interest income on the cash consideration provided in connection with the acquisition.
(d)
        
 
Represents the elimination of the Company's 32.9% share of Toys' management fees.
(e)
         
 
Represents the limited partners' share of the above adjustments.
(f)
           
 
 
FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT").  NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus specified non-cash items, such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity REITs.  FFO and FFO per diluted share should be evaluated along with GAAP net income and income per diluted share (the most directly comparable GAAP measures), as well as cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, in evaluating the operating performance of equity REITs.  Management believes that FFO and FFO per diluted share are helpful to investors as supplemental performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time.  Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, these non-GAAP measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs.  FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company's operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
 
 
 
 
Notes to Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2004:
 
Reflects the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income of the Company for the Year Ended December 31, 2004.
(a)
         
 
EBITDA represents "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization".  See page 3 of this Exhibit 99.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K/A for further information.
(b)
        
 
Reflects the Company's 32.9% interest in Toys Net income (loss) for the Year Ended January 29, 2005, accounted for under the equity method.  The Company's fiscal year ends on December 31 whereas Toys fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31, therefore the Company will record its pro-rata share of Toys Net income (loss) on a one-quarter lag basis.  See Exhibit 99.5.
(c)
         
 
Reflects the reduction of interest income on the cash consideration paid in connection with the acquisition.
(d)
        
 
Represents the elimination of the Company's 32.9% share of Toys management fees.
(e)
         
 
Represents the limited partners' share of the above adjustments.
(f)
           
 
FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). See page 4 of this Exhibit 99.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K/A for further information.
 

Exhibit 99.4
 
The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information of Toys "R" Us, Inc. ("Toys") has been derived by application of pro forma adjustments to the audited historical consolidated financial statements of Toys for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2005 and the unaudited historical condensed consolidated financial statements of Toys as of and for the 26 Weeks Ended July 30, 2005.  Management believes that the July 30, 2005 unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet presents a reasonable basis for the financial position of Toys at July 21, 2005.  The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet gives effect to the acquisition as if it had occurred on July 30, 2005.  The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the 26 weeks ended July 30, 2005 and the fiscal year ended January 29, 2005 give effect to the acquisition as if it had been consummated on February 1, 2004.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated information, including the allocation of the purchase price, is based on estimates and preliminary valuations of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  Further refinements to these estimates and related allocation of the purchase price may be made based on final valuations.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information is presented for information purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what Toys actual results of operations or financial position would have been had the acquisition been consummated on the dates indicated, nor does it purport to represent Toys results of operations or financial position for any future period.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with (i) the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Toys as of and for the year ended January 29, 2005 which were filed by Toys with the SEC on April 29, 2005 under Part I, Item 8 of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended January 29, 2005, and which are filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on this Form 8-K/A; and (ii) the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Toys as of and for the 26 weeks ended July 30, 2005, which were filed by Toys with the SEC on September 14, 2005 under Part I, Item 1 of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended July 30, 2005, and which are filed as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K/A.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information for Toys that follows has been prepared solely to enable the Company to prepare its own unaudited pro forma financial information reflecting the application of purchase accounting to its acquisition of an indirect interest in Toys.  As a separate reporting company, Toys has informed the Company that it will be preparing and presenting its consolidated financial statements on a historical basis and will not apply purchase accounting.

Exhibit 99.5
 
UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 
Vornado Realty Trust (the "Company") has supplementally furnished the pro forma information below because the business of Toys is highly seasonal.  Based on Toys' annual report for the year ended January 29, 2005, the first quarter ended May 1, 2004 and the third quarter ended October 30, 2004 resulted in net losses, and the second quarter ended July 31, 2004 and the fourth quarter ended January 29, 2005 resulted in net income with the fourth quarter accounting for over 80% of Toys' net income for the year ended January 29, 2005.  Accordingly, the Company's financial statements will be affected by the seasonality of Toys' business.
 
In addition, the Company's fiscal year ends on December 31 whereas Toys' fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31, therefore, the Company will record its pro-rata share of Toys' net income (loss) on a one quarter-lag basis.  For example, the Company's financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31 will include Toys' financial results for the third quarter ended October 30, and the Company's financial results for the year ended December 31 will include Toys' financial results for its first, second and third quarters ended October 30, as well as its fourth quarter results of the prior year.  This exhibit presents the Company's 32.9% equity in Toys' unaudited pro forma financial results prepared on a one-quarter lag basis for the Company's third and fourth quarters of 2004 and the first and second quarters of 2005.
 
 
In the third quarter ended September 30, 2005, the Company will record a net loss of approximately $3,000 ($.02 per share) representing the Company's 32.9% share of Toys' net loss in Toys' second quarter ended July 30, 2005 for the period from July 21, 2005 (the date of the Toys acquisition by the Company) to July 30, 2005.  The Company's FFO will be negatively impacted by approximately $2,000 ($.01 per share) for the same period.
(a)
         
 
Does not exclude (i) the Company's $51,653 share of Toys $157,000 inventory markdown recorded in their second quarter ended July 31, 2004 primarily to liquidate selected older toy store inventory which is expected to enhance store productivity and supply chain efficiency and (ii) the Company's $65,800 share of Toys $200,000 reversal of prior year's tax reserves in the same quarter.
(b)
        
 
EBITDA represents "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization". See page 3 of this Exhibit 99.5 to this Current Report on Form 8-K/A for further information.

Notes to Unaudited Supplemental Pro Forma Financial Information:
 
Reflects the Company's 32.9% interest in Toys' Net income (loss) accounted for under the equity method and includes the elimination of the Company's 32.9% share of Toys' management fees of $1,744 per quarter.
(a)
         
 
Reflects the reduction of interest income on the cash consideration paid in connection with the acquisition.
(b)
        
 
EBITDA represents "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization". Management considers EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of its segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity.  As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, management utilizes this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of its assets to that of its peers.  EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT").  NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus specified non-cash items, such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity REITs.  FFO and FFO per diluted share should be evaluated along with GAAP net income and income per diluted share (the most directly comparable GAAP measures), as well as cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, in evaluating the operating performance of equity REITs. Management believes that FFO and FFO per diluted share are helpful to investors as supplemental performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time.  Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, these non-GAAP measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs.  FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company's operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
