In order to listen to the live audio webcast, please visit the website at least 15 minutes in advance to register. A replay of the webcast will be available for approximately 45 days by accessing the above address. Certain statements contained in or made during the presentation may constitute forward-looking statements as such term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The companies' future results, financial condition and business may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. You can find many of these statements by looking for words such as "approximates," "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "would," "may" or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Many of the factors that will determine these items are beyond our ability to control or predict. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those set forth in the companies' Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2004 under "Forward Looking Statements" and "Item 1. Business -- Certain Factors That May Adversely Affect Our Business and Operations." For these statements, the companies claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The companies expressly disclaim any responsibility to update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on forward-looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. ITEM 9.01.
