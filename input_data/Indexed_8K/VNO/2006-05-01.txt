ITEM 1.01
Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
                                      
 
On April 25, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Trustees (the "Compensation Committee") of Vornado Realty Trust (the "Company") approved the form of award agreement to be used to grant awards under the Vornado Realty Trust 2006 Outperformance Plan (the "2006 Outperformance Plan"). The 2006 Outperformance Plan is a new long-term incentive compensation program approved by the Compensation Committee and the Company's Board of Trustees on March 17, 2006 that is designed to create shareholder value in a "pay-for-performance" structure. As previously reported, under the 2006 Outperformance Plan the Company's senior management team has the opportunity to share in a performance pool if the Company's total return to shareholders over the three-year performance period from March 15, 2006 through March 14, 2009 exceeds a cumulative 30%, including both share appreciation and dividends paid, from a price per share of $89.17 (the average closing price per common share of the Company for the 30 trading days prior to March 15, 2006). The size of the pool will be 10% of the outperformance return amount in excess of the 30% benchmark, subject to a maximum dilution cap equal to $100 million. A portion of the performance pool can be earned after the first and second years, up to a cumulative maximum of $20 million and $40 million, respectively, based on a minimum total return to shareholders benchmark of 10% and 20%, respectively. In the event the potential performance pool reaches the $20 million dilution cap before March 14, 2007, the $40 million dilution cap before March 14, 2008 or the $100 million dilution cap before March 14, 2009, and remains at the applicable level or higher for 30 consecutive days, the applicable performance period will end early and the applicable pool will be established on the last day of such 30 day period. Compensation earned under the program vests 33-1/3% on each of March 15, 2009, 2010 and 2011 based on continued employment.
 
Individual awards are in the form of equity-based securities under the Company's 2002 Omnibus Share Plan, as amended. The award agreement designates each recipient's percentage of the potential performance pool established under the 2006 Outperformance Plan, with the award being in the form of a new class of units of Vornado Realty L.P. (the "Operating Partnership"), the entity through which the Company conducts substantially all its business. We refer to these awards as "Operating Partnership performance units" or "OPP Units."  OPP Units, subject to performance, time vesting and other conditions, are convertible by the holder into an equivalent number of the Operating Partnership's Class A Units, which are redeemable by the holder for common shares of the Company on a one-for-one basis or the cash value of such shares, at the Company's election. OPP Units are issued prior to the determination of the performance pool, but remain subject to forfeiture to the extent that less than the full number awarded is earned based on total return to shareholders over the three-year measurement period.
 
The number of OPP Units awarded to the Company's nine executive officers are as follows: Steven Roth, 281,250 units; Michael D. Fascitelli, 281,250 units; Michelle Felman, 68,750 units; David R. Greenbaum, 50,000 units; Chrisopher G. Kennedy, 50,000 units; Joseph Macnow, 56,250 units; Sandeep Mathrani, 75,000 units; Mitchell N. Schear, 50,000 units and Wendy Silverstein, 81,250 units. The number of such OPP Units that will actually be earned depends on the total return to shareholders of the Company over the three-year performance period and the number of OPP Units issued is not a projection of the number of OPP Units that will be earned. These individual awards
Awards under the 2006 Outperformance Plan have been made to a total of 54 officers of the Company.
represent a calculation of the maximum number of OPP Units that, based on each recipient's percentage of the potential performance pool, could be earned by him or her over the term of the 2006 Outperformance Plan, if all performance and vesting hurdles are met, based on certain assumptions. The number of OPP Units actually earned by each recipient, if any, may be less than the number awarded.
 
In addition, pursuant to the Thirty-Third Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Vornado Realty L.P. referred to in Item 5.03 below and under the Company's 2002 Omnibus Share Plan (as recently amended to permit the Compensation Committee of the Board to grant awards in the form of limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership), the Company has granted, on April 25, 2006, 49,851 restricted Operating Partnership units, in the aggregate, to members of management including the following grants:  15,578 units to Steven Roth; 15,578 units to Michael D. Fascitelli; 5,193 units to Michelle Felman; 1,558 units to Christopher G. Kennedy; 5,193 units to Joseph Macnow; 1,558 units to Mitchell N. Shear; and 5,193 units to Wendy Silverstein. We refer to these Operating Partnership units as "Restricted Units," or "Restricted LTIP Units" and they are separate and distinct from OPP Units. Restricted Units are profit interests in the Operating Partnership that, upon the allocation of profits from the Operating Partnership over time, may be converted into the Operating Partnership's Class A common units and, consequently, become convertible by the holder on a one-for-one basis for the Company's common shares or the cash value of such shares, at the Company's election. Restricted Units are similar to the restricted shares previously granted by the Company to members of management and are subject to similar vesting restrictions.
 
The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copies of the form of award agreement under the 2006 Outperformance Plan, the Thirty-Third Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership, and the Form of Restricted LTIP Unit Agreement which are attached hereto as , and respectively, to this Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year. (Item 5.03 applies to Vornado Realty L.P. only)
 
In connection with the award of OPP Units referred to in Item 1.01, on April 25, 2006, the Company, in its capacity as sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, amended the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership in order to establish the terms of a new class of units, including the OPP Units, which are structured to qualify as "profits interests" for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, OPP Units initially will not have full parity, on a per unit basis, with Class A Units with respect to liquidating distributions. Upon the occurrence of specified events, the OPP Units can over time achieve full parity with Class A Units, at which time OPP Units that have been earned based on performance may be converted, subject to the satisfaction of applicable vesting conditions, on a one-for-one basis into Class A Units. OPP Units will not be entitled to receive distributions until the final performance measure is met. To the extent that a performance pool is established, award recipients will be entitled to an amount equal to the distributions that would have been paid on their earned OPP Units after March 15, 2006 on a per unit basis equal to Class A Units, payable in the form of additional OPP Units. Thereafter OPP Units, whether or not then vested, will receive distributions on a per unit basis equal to the distributions payable on Class A Units (which are equal to dividends payable on common shares of the Company).
 
The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copies of the form of award agreement under the 2006 Outperformance Plan, the Thirty-Third Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership, and the Form of Restricted LTIP Unit Agreement which are attached hereto as , and respectively, to this Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in Section 1 of Exhibit C hereto, and notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 6.1.A and 6.1.B above, in the event that, due to distributions with respect to Class A Units in which the LTIP Units do not participate or otherwise, the Economic Capital Account Balance of any present or former holder of LTIP Units, to the extent attributable to the holder's ownership of LTIP Units, exceeds the target balance specified above, then Liquidating Losses shall be allocated to such holder to the extent necessary to reduce or eliminate the disparity.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as otherwise permitted by the award, plan or other agreement pursuant to which an LTIP Units was issued, the Redemption Right shall not be exercisable with respect to any Class A Unit issued upon conversion of an LTIP Unit until on or after the date that is two years after the date on which the LTIP Unit was issued, provided however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply if the Redemption Right is exercised by a LTIP Unit holder in connection with a transaction that falls within the definition of a "change of control" under the agreement or agreements pursuant to which the LTIP Units were issued to him or her and provided further that the one (1) and two (2) year requirement set forth in the first sentence of Subsection 8.6.A(i) shall not apply with respect to Class A Units issued upon conversion of LTIP Units.

Adjustments
 
The Partnership shall maintain at all times a one-to-one correspondence between LTIP Units and Class A Units for conversion, distribution and other purposes, including without limitation complying with the following procedures; provided that the foregoing is not intended to alter the Capital Account Limitation (as defined in Section 7.C of this ), the special allocations pursuant to Section 6.1.F of the Partnership Agreement, differences between non-liquidating distributions to be made with respect to the LTIP Units and Class A Units prior to the Distribution Participation Date for such LTIP Units, differences between liquidating distributions to be made with respect to the LTIP Units and Class A Units pursuant to Section 13.2 of the Partnership Agreement or Section 2.A of this Exhibit AH in the event that the Capital Accounts attributable to the LTIP Units are less than those attributable to the Class A Units due to insufficient special allocations pursuant to Section 6.1.F of the Partnership Agreement or related provisions. If an Adjustment Event (as defined below) occurs, then the General Partner shall make a corresponding adjustment to the LTIP Units to maintain such one-for-one correspondence between Class A Units and LTIP Units. The following shall be "":  (A) the Partnership makes a distribution on all outstanding Class A Units in Partnership Units, (B) the Partnership subdivides the outstanding Class A Units into a greater number of units or combines the outstanding Class A Units into a smaller number of units, or (C) the Partnership issues any Partnership Units in exchange for its outstanding Class A Units by way of a reclassification or recapitalization of its Class A Units. If more than one Adjustment Event occurs, the adjustment to the LTIP Units need be made only once using a single formula that takes into account each and every Adjustment Event as if all Adjustment Events occurred simultaneously. For the avoidance of doubt, the following
Exhibit AH
Adjustment Events
shall not be Adjustment Events: (x) the issuance of Partnership Units in a financing, reorganization, acquisition or other similar business transaction, (y) the issuance of Partnership Units pursuant to any employee benefit or compensation plan or distribution reinvestment plan, or (z) the issuance of any Partnership Units to the General Partner in respect of a capital contribution to the Partnership of proceeds from the sale of securities by the General Partner. If the Partnership takes an action affecting the Class A Units other than actions specifically described above as Adjustment Events and in the opinion of the General Partner such action would require an adjustment to the LTIP Units to maintain the one-to-one correspondence described above, the General Partner shall have the right to make such adjustment to the LTIP Units, to the extent permitted by law and by the terms of any plan pursuant to which the LTIP Units have been issued in such manner and at such time as the General Partner, in its sole discretion, may determine to be appropriate under the circumstances. If an adjustment is made to the LTIP Units as herein provided the Partnership shall promptly file in the books and records of the Partnership an officer's certificate setting forth such adjustment and a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment, which certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of such adjustment absent manifest error. Promptly after filing of such certificate, the Partnership shall mail a notice to each holder of LTIP Units setting forth the adjustment to his or her LTIP Units and the effective date of such adjustment.

A. . A holder of LTIP Units shall have the right (the ""), at his or her option, at any time to convert all or a portion of his or her Vested LTIP Units into Class A Units. Holders of LTIP Units shall not have the right to convert Unvested LTIP Units into Class A Units until they become Vested LTIP Units; , , that when a holder of LTIP Units is notified of the expected occurrence of an event that will cause his or her Unvested LTIP Units to become Vested LTIP Units, such Person may give the Partnership a Conversion Notice conditioned upon and effective as of the time of vesting, and such Conversion Notice, unless subsequently revoked by the holder of the LTIP Units, shall be accepted by the Partnership subject to such condition. The General Partner shall have the right at any time to cause a conversion of Vested LTIP Units into Class A Units. In all cases, the conversion of any

LTIP Units into Class A Units shall be subject to the conditions and procedures set forth in this Section 7.
 
B. . A holder of Vested LTIP Units may convert such Vested LTIP Units into an equal number of fully paid and non-assessable Class A Units, giving effect to all adjustments (if any) made pursuant to Section 4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may a holder of Vested LTIP Units convert a number of Vested LTIP Units that exceeds (x) the Economic Capital Account Balance of such holder, to the extent attributable to its ownership of LTIP Units, divided by (y) the Class A Unit Economic Balance, in each case as determined as of the effective date of conversion (the "").

C. . In order to exercise his or her Conversion Right, a holder of LTIP Units shall deliver a notice (a "") in the form attached as Attachment A to this Exhibit AH to the Partnership not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to a date (the "") specified in such Conversion Notice. Each holder of LTIP Units covenants and agrees with the Partnership that all Vested LTIP Units to be converted pursuant to this Section 7 shall be free and clear of all liens. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary or the holding period requirement of Section 8.6A(i) of the Agreement (but subject to the remainder of Section 8.6), a holder of LTIP Units may deliver a Redemption Notice pursuant to Section 8.6 of the Agreement relating to those Class A Units that will be issued to such holder upon conversion of such LTIP Units into Class A Units in advance of the Conversion Date; provided, however, that the redemption of such Class A Units by the Partnership shall in no event take place until the Conversion Date. For clarity, it is noted that the objective of this paragraph is to put a holder of LTIP Units in a position where, if he or she so wishes, the Class A Units into which his or her Vested LTIP Units will be converted can be redeemed by the Partnership simultaneously with such conversion notwithstanding such Class A Units were not held for one (1) year, with the further consequence that, if the General Partner elects to assume the Partnership's redemption obligation with respect to such Class A Units under Section 8.6 of the Agreement by delivering to such holder Shares rather than cash, then such holder can have such Shares issued to him or her simultaneously with the conversion of his or her Vested LTIP Units into Class A Units. The General Partner shall cooperate with a holder of LTIP Units to coordinate the timing of the different events described in the foregoing sentence.

The Partnership, at any time at the election of the General Partner, may cause any number of Vested LTIP Units held by a holder of LTIP Units to be converted (a "") into an equal number of Class A Units, giving effect to all adjustments (if any) made pursuant to Section 4; , that the Partnership may not cause a Forced Conversion of any LTIP Units that would not at the time be eligible for conversion at the option of the holder of such LTIP Units pursuant to Section 7.B above. In order to exercise its right to cause a Forced Conversion, the Partnership shall deliver a notice (a "") in the form attached as

Forced Conversion Notice
Attachment B to this Exhibit AH to the applicable holder not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the Conversion Date specified in such Forced Conversion Notice. A Forced Conversion Notice shall be provided in the manner provided in Section 15.1 of the Agreement.
 
E. . A conversion of Vested LTIP Units for which the holder thereof has given a Conversion Notice or the Partnership has given a Forced Conversion Notice shall occur automatically after the close of business on the applicable Conversion Date without any action on the part of such holder of LTIP Units, as of which time such holder of LTIP Units shall be credited on the books and records of the Partnership with the issuance as of the opening of business on the next day of the number of Class A Units issuable upon such conversion. After the conversion of LTIP Units as aforesaid, the Partnership shall deliver to such holder of LTIP Units, upon his or her written request, a certificate of the General Partner certifying the number of Class A Units and remaining LTIP Units, if any, held by such Person immediately after such conversion.
Conversion Procedures
 
F. . For purposes of making future allocations under Section 6.1.F of the Agreement and applying the Capital Account Limitation, the portion of the Economic Capital Account balance of the applicable holder of LTIP Units that is treated as attributable to his or her LTIP Units shall be reduced, as of the date of conversion, by the product of the number of LTIP Units converted and the Class A Unit Economic Balance.
Treatment of Capital Account
 
G. . If the Partnership or the General Partner shall be a party to any transaction (including without limitation a merger, consolidation, unit exchange, self tender offer for all or substantially all Class A Units or other business combination or reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of the Partnership's assets, but excluding any transaction which constitutes an Adjustment Event), in each case as a result of which Class A Units shall be exchanged for or converted into the right, or the holders of Class A Units shall otherwise be entitled, to receive cash, securities or other property or any combination thereof (each of the foregoing being referred to herein as a ""), then the General Partner shall, immediately prior to the Transaction, exercise its right to cause a Forced Conversion with respect to the maximum number of LTIP Units then eligible for conversion, taking into account any allocations that occur in connection with the Transaction or that would occur in connection with the Transaction if the assets of the Partnership were sold at the Transaction price or, if applicable, at a value determined by the General Partner in good faith using the value attributed to the Partnership Units in the context of the Transaction (in which case the Conversion Date shall be the effective date of the Transaction and the conversion shall occur immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Transaction).
Mandatory Conversion in Connection with a Transaction
Transaction
