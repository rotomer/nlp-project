Promptly upon issuance of a Letter of Credit, the Fronting Bank shall notify Administrative Agent and Administrative Agent shall notify each of the Banks by telephone or by facsimile.
(b)           The amount of any such Letter of Credit shall be limited to the lesser of (1) Four Hundred Million Dollars ($400,000,000) less the aggregate face amount of all other Letters of Credit then issued and outstanding or (2) the Available Total Loan Commitment, it being understood that the amount of each Letter of Credit issued and outstanding shall effect a reduction, by an equal amount, of the Available Total Loan Commitment as provided in Section 2.01(b) (such reduction to be allocated to each Bank's Loan Commitment ratably in accordance with the Banks' respective Pro Rata Shares).
(c)           The amount of each Letter of Credit shall be further subject to the conditions and limitations applicable to amounts of advances set forth in Section 2.04 and the procedures for the issuance of each Letter of Credit shall be the same as the procedures applicable to the making of advances as set forth in the first sentence of Section 2.05.
(d)           The Fronting Bank's issuance of each Letter of Credit shall be subject to Borrower's satisfaction of all conditions precedent to its entitlement to an advance of proceeds of the Loans.
(e)           Each Letter of Credit shall (i) unless approved by the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Bank, expire no later than the earlier of (x) fourteen (14) days prior to the Maturity Date or (y), one (1) year after the date of its issuance (without regard to any automatic renewal provisions thereof), and (ii) be in a minimum amount of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), or such lesser amount approved by the Fronting Bank. In no event shall a Letter of Credit expire later than the first anniversary of the Maturity Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, with the approval of the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Bank, any Letters of Credit are issued and outstanding on the date that is fourteen (14) days prior to the Maturity Date, Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent on such date by wire transfer of immediately available funds a cash deposit in the amount of such Letters of Credit in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.17(i). Such funds shall be held by Administrative Agent in an interest bearing account and applied to repay the Loans in the event of any drawing under such Letters of Credit on or after the Maturity Date. Such funds, with any interest earned thereon, will be returned to Borrower (and may be returned from time to time with respect to any applicable Letter of Credit) on the earlier of (a) the date that the applicable Letter of Credit or Letters of Credit expire in accordance with their terms; and (b) the date that the applicable Letter of Credit or Letters of Credit are cancelled.

Administrative Agent shall have no responsibility for the collection of the fee for any Letter of Credit that is payable to the Fronting Bank. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Banks' L/C Fee Rate" shall mean, provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin for LIBOR Loans and, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, a rate per annum equal to 3%. It is understood and agreed that the last installment of the fees provided for in this paragraph (g) with respect to any particular Letter of Credit shall be due and payable on the first day of the calendar quarter following the return, undrawn, or cancellation, of such Letter of Credit.
(h)           The Fronting Bank shall promptly notify Administrative Agent of any drawing under a Letter of Credit issued by such Fronting Bank. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, immediately upon notice from Administrative Agent of any drawing under a Letter of Credit, each Bank shall, notwithstanding the existence of a Default or Event of Default or the non-satisfaction of any conditions precedent to the making of an advance of the Loans, advance proceeds of its Ratable Loan, in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of such drawing, which advance shall be made to Administrative Agent for disbursement to the Fronting Bank issuing such Letter of Credit to reimburse the Fronting Bank, for its own account, for such drawing. Each of the Banks further acknowledges that its obligation to fund its Pro Rata Share of drawings under Letters of Credit as aforesaid shall survive the Banks' termination of this Agreement or enforcement of remedies hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. If any Ratable Loan cannot for any reason be made on the date otherwise required above (including, without limitation, as a result of the commencement of a proceeding under any applicable bankruptcy law with respect to Borrower), then each of the Banks shall purchase (on the date such Ratable Loan would otherwise have been made) from the Fronting Bank a participation interest in any unreimbursed drawing in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of such unreimbursed drawing.
(i)            Borrower agrees, upon and during the occurrence of an Event of Default and at the request of Administrative Agent, (x) to deposit with Administrative Agent cash collateral in the amount of all the outstanding Letters of Credit, which cash collateral is hereby pledged and shall be held by Administrative Agent in an account as security for Borrower's obligations in connection with the Letters of Credit and (y) to execute and deliver to Administrative Agent such documents as Administrative Agent requests to confirm and perfect the assignment of such cash collateral and such account to Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Banks. Any such cash collateral deposited with Administrative Agent shall be returned immediately to Borrower upon the cure of such Event of Default.

YIELD PROTECTION; ILLEGALITY; ETC.
SECTION 3.01.   . Borrower shall pay directly to each Bank from time to time on demand such amounts as such Bank may reasonably determine to be necessary to compensate it for any increased costs which such Bank determines are attributable to its making or maintaining a LIBOR Loan or a Bid Rate Loan, or its obligation to make or maintain a LIBOR Loan or a Bid Rate Loan, or its obligation to Convert a Base Rate Loan to a LIBOR Loan hereunder, or any reduction in any amount receivable by such Bank hereunder in respect of its LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan(s) or such obligations (such increases in costs and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called ""), in each case resulting from any Regulatory Change which:
Additional Costs
Additional Costs
(1)           changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to such Bank under this Agreement or the Notes in respect of any such LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan (other than (i) changes in the rate of general corporate, franchise, branch profit, net income or other income tax imposed on such Bank or its Applicable Lending Office or (ii) a tax described in Section 10.13); or
(2)           (other than to the extent the LIBOR Reserve Requirement is taken into account in determining the LIBOR Rate at the commencement of the applicable Interest Period) imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit, deposit insurance or assessment, minimum capital, capital ratio or similar requirements relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities of, such
32
Bank (including any LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan or any deposits referred to in the definition of "LIBOR Interest Rate" in Section 1.01), or any commitment of such Bank (including such Bank's Loan Commitment hereunder); or
(3)           imposes any other condition (unrelated to the basis of taxation referred to in paragraph (1) above) affecting this Agreement or the Notes (or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities).
Without limiting the effect of the provisions of the first paragraph of this Section, in the event that, by reason of any Regulatory Change, any Bank either (1) incurs Additional Costs based on or measured by the excess above a specified level of the amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities of such Bank which includes deposits by reference to which the LIBOR Interest Rate is determined as provided in this Agreement or a category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Bank which includes loans based on the LIBOR Interest Rate or (2) becomes subject to restrictions on the amount of such a category of liabilities or assets which it may hold, then, if such Bank so elects by notice to Borrower (with a copy to Administrative Agent), the obligation of such Bank to permit Elections of, to Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended (in which case the provisions of Section 3.04 shall be applicable) until such Regulatory Change ceases to be in effect.
The obligations of Borrower under this Section shall survive the repayment of all amounts due under or in connection with any of the Loan Documents and the termination of the Loan Commitments in respect of the period prior to such termination.
Determinations and allocations by a Bank for purposes of this Section of the effect of any Regulatory Change pursuant to the first or second paragraph of this Section, on its costs or rate of return of making or maintaining its Loan or portions thereof or on amounts receivable by it in respect of its Loan or portions thereof, and the amounts required to compensate such Bank under this Section, shall be included in a calculation of such amounts given to Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
SECTION 3.02.   . Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determination of the LIBOR Interest Rate for any Interest Period:
Limitation on Types of Loans
(1)           Administrative Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive) that quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits referred to in the definition of "LIBOR Interest Rate" in Section 1.01 are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of determining rates of interest for the LIBOR Loans or Bid Rate Loans as provided in this Agreement; or
(2)           a Bank reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive) and promptly notifies Administrative Agent that the relevant rates of interest referred to in the definition of "LIBOR Interest Rate" in Section 1.01 upon the basis of which the rate of interest for LIBOR Loans or Bid Rate Loans for such Interest Period is to be determined do not adequately cover the cost to such Bank of making or maintaining such LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan for such Interest Period;
33
then Administrative Agent shall give Borrower prompt notice thereof, and so long as such condition remains in effect, the Banks (or, in the case of the circumstances described in clause (2) above, the affected Bank) shall be under no obligation to permit Elections of LIBOR Loans, to Convert Base Rate Loans into LIBOR Loans or to Continue LIBOR Loans and Borrower shall, on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for the affected outstanding LIBOR Loans or Bid Rate Loans, either (x) prepay the affected LIBOR Loans or Bid Rate Loans pursuant to Section 3.07 or (y) Convert the affected LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans in accordance with Section 2.12 or convert the rate of interest under the affected Bid Rate Loans to the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans by following the same procedures as are applicable for Conversions into Base Rate Loans set forth in Section 2.12.
SECTION 3.03.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Bank or its Applicable Lending Office to honor its obligation to make or maintain a LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan hereunder, to allow Elections or Continuations of a LIBOR Loan or to Convert a Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan, then such Bank shall promptly notify Administrative Agent and Borrower thereof and such Bank's obligation to make or maintain a LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan, or to permit Elections of, to Continue, or to Convert its Base Rate Loan into, a LIBOR Loan shall be suspended (in which case the provisions of Section 3.04 shall be applicable) until such time as such Bank may again make and maintain a LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan.
Illegality
SECTION 3.04.   . If the obligations of any Bank to make or maintain a LIBOR Loan or a Bid Rate Loan, or to permit an Election of a LIBOR Loan, to Continue its LIBOR Loan, or to Convert its Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan, are suspended pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.03 (each LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan so affected being herein called an "Affected Loan"), such Bank's Affected Loan shall be automatically Converted into a Base Rate Loan (or, in the case of an Affected Loan that is a Bid Rate Loan, the interest rate thereon shall be converted to the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans) on the last day of the then current Interest Period for the Affected Loan (or, in the case of a Conversion or conversion resulting from Section 3.01 or 3.03, on such earlier date as such Bank may specify to Borrower).
Treatment of Affected Loans
To the extent that such Bank's Affected Loan has been so Converted (or the interest rate thereon so converted), all payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise be applied to such Bank's Affected Loan shall be applied instead to its Base Rate Loan (or to its Bid Rate Loan bearing interest at the converted rate) and such Bank shall have no obligation to Convert its Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan.
SECTION 3.05.   . Other than in connection with a Conversion of an Affected Loan, Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Bank, upon the request of such Bank through Administrative Agent which request includes a calculation of the amount(s) due, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of such Bank) to compensate it for any loss, cost or expense which such Bank reasonably determines is attributable to:
Certain Compensation
(1)           any payment or prepayment of a LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan made by such Bank, or any Conversion of a LIBOR Loan (or conversion of the rate of interest on a
34
Bid Rate Loan) made by such Bank, in any such case on a date other than the last day of an applicable Interest Period, whether by reason of acceleration or otherwise;
(2)           any failure by Borrower for any reason to Convert a LIBOR Loan or a Base Rate Loan or to Continue a LIBOR Loan, as the case may be, to be Converted or Continued by such Bank on the date specified therefor in the relevant notice under Section 2.14;
(3)           any failure by Borrower to borrow (or to qualify for a borrowing of) a LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan which would otherwise be made hereunder on the date specified in the relevant Election notice under Section 2.14 or Bid Rate Quote acceptance under Section 2.02(e) given or submitted by Borrower; or
(4)           any failure by Borrower to prepay a LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan on the date specified in a notice of prepayment.
Without limiting the foregoing, such compensation shall include an amount equal to the present value (using as the discount rate an interest rate equal to the rate determined under (2) below) of the excess, if any, of (1) the amount of interest (less the Applicable Margin) which otherwise would have accrued on the principal amount so paid, prepaid, Converted or Continued (or not Converted, Continued or borrowed) for the period from the date of such payment, prepayment, Conversion or Continuation (or failure to Convert, Continue or borrow) to the last day of the then current applicable Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to Convert, Continue or borrow, to the last day of the applicable Interest Period which would have commenced on the date specified therefor in the relevant notice) at the applicable rate of interest for the LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan provided for herein, over (2) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Bank) based upon the interest rate which such Bank would have bid in the London interbank market for Dollar deposits, for amounts comparable to such principal amount and maturities comparable to such period. A determination of any Bank as to the amounts payable pursuant to this Section shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
The obligations of Borrower under this Section shall survive the repayment of all amounts due under or in connection with any of the Loan Documents and the termination of the Loan Commitments in respect of the period prior to such termination.
SECTION 3.06.   . If any Bank shall have determined that, after the date hereof, the adoption of, or any change in, any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to Administrative Agent), Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional
Capital Adequacy
35
amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for such reduction. A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis therefor, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The obligations of Borrower under this Section shall survive the repayment of all amounts due under or in connection with any of the Loan Documents and the termination of the Loan Commitments in respect of the period prior to such termination.
SECTION 3.07.   . If any Bank (an "") (i) makes demand upon Borrower for (or if Borrower is otherwise required to pay) Additional Costs pursuant to Section 3.01, (ii) is unable to make or maintain a LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan as a result of a condition described in Section 3.03, or clause (2) of Section 3.02 or (iii) has any increased costs as described in Section 3.06, Borrower may, within ninety (90) days of receipt of such demand or notice (or the occurrence of such other event causing Borrower to be required to pay Additional Costs or causing the condition described in Section 3.03, clause (2) of Section 3.02 or Section 3.06 to be applicable to occur), as the case may be, give written notice (a "") to Administrative Agent and to each Bank of Borrower's intention either (x) to prepay in full the Affected Bank's Note and to terminate the Affected Bank's entire Loan Commitment or (y) to replace the Affected Bank with another financial institution (the "") designated in such Replacement Notice. After its replacement, an Affected Bank shall remain entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.06, 10.13 and 12.04 in respect of the period prior to its replacement.

After any termination as provided in this paragraph, an Affected Bank shall remain entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.06, 10.13 and 12.04 in respect of the period prior to such termination.
provided
In the event Borrower opts to give the notice provided for in clause (y) above, and if (i) Administrative Agent shall, within thirty (30) days of its receipt of the Replacement Notice, notify Borrower and each Bank in writing that the Replacement Bank is reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent and (ii) the Affected Bank shall not, prior to the end of such thirty (30) day period, agree to waive the payment of the Additional Costs in question or the effect of the circumstances described in Section 3.03, clause (2) of Section 3.02, or Section 3.06 then the Affected Bank shall, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall exist, assign its Note and all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to the Replacement Bank, and the Replacement Bank shall assume all of the Affected Bank's rights and obligations, pursuant to an agreement, substantially in the form of an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, executed by the Affected Bank and the Replacement Bank. In connection with such assignment and assumption, the Replacement Bank shall pay to the Affected Bank an amount equal to the
36
outstanding principal amount under the Affected Bank's Note plus all interest accrued thereon, plus all other amounts, if any (other than the Additional Costs in question), then due and payable to the Affected Bank; , , that prior to or simultaneously with any such assignment and assumption, Borrower shall have paid to such Affected Bank all amounts properly demanded and unreimbursed under Sections 3.01 and 3.05. Upon the effective date of such assignment and assumption, the Replacement Bank shall become a Bank Party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank as set forth in such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, and the Affected Bank shall be released from its obligations hereunder, and no further consent or action by any party shall be required. Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this Section, a substitute Ratable Loan Note shall be issued to the Replacement Bank by Borrower, in exchange for the return of the Affected Bank's Ratable Loan Note. The obligations evidenced by such substitute note shall constitute "Obligations" for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. If the Replacement Bank is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof, it shall, prior to the first date on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for its account, deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent a certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with Section 10.13. Each Replacement Bank shall be deemed to have made the representations contained in, and shall be bound by the provisions of, Section 10.13.  After any assignment as provided in this paragraph, an Affected Bank shall remain entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.06, 10.13 and 12.04 in respect of the period prior to such assignment.
provided
however
Borrower, Administrative Agent and the Banks shall execute such modifications to the Loan Documents as shall be reasonably required in connection with and to effectuate the foregoing.
SECTION 3.08.   .
Obligation of Banks to Mitigate
Each Bank agrees that, as promptly as practicable after such Bank has actual knowledge of the occurrence of an event or the existence of a condition that would cause such Bank to become an Affected Bank or that would entitle such Bank to receive payments under Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03 or 3.06, it will, to the extent not inconsistent with any applicable legal or regulatory restrictions, use reasonable efforts (i) to make, issue, fund, or maintain the Loan Commitment of such Bank or the affected Loans of such Bank through another lending office of such Bank, or (ii) take such other measures as such Bank may deem reasonable, if as a result thereof the circumstances that would cause such Bank to be an Affected Bank would cease to exist or the additional amounts that would otherwise be required to be paid to such Bank pursuant to Sections 3.01, 3.02 3.03 or 3.06 would be reduced and if, as determined by such Bank in its sole discretion, the making, issuing, funding, or maintaining of such Loan Commitment or Loans through such other lending office or in accordance with such other measures, as the case may be, would not otherwise adversely affect such Loan Commitment or Loans or would not be otherwise disadvantageous to the interests of such Bank.
