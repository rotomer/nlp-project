ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS
This current report on Form 8-K of Vornado Realty Trust (the "Company") updates Part II, Items 6, 7 and 8 of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005. The Company is electing to re-issue in an updated format the presentation of its historical financial statements to reclassify the income and expenses of three properties (33 North Dearborn Street, 424 Sixth Avenue, and 1919 South Eads Street) to discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of income and the related assets and liabilities to assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheets.  During the first quarter of 2006, 33 North Dearborn Street and 424 Sixth Avenue met the criteria for such classification and were classified as such in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2006.  During the second quarter of 2006, 1919 South Eads Street met the criteria for such classification and was classified as such in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006.  These reclassifications have no effect on the Company's reported net income or funds from operations.
The information contained in this current report on Form 8-K is presented as of December 31, 2005, and other than as indicated above, has not been updated to reflect developments subsequent to this date.  All other items of the Form 10-K remain unchanged.

Operating results for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 reflect the consolidation of the Company's investment in Americold Realty Trust beginning on November 18, 2004.  Previously, this investment was accounted for on the equity method.
(1)
            
Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2002, reflect the Company's January 1, 2002 acquisition of the remaining 66% of Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P. ("CESCR") and the resulting consolidation of CESCR's operations.
(2)
            
FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT").  NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus specified non-cash items, such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  FFO is used by management, investors and industry analysts as a supplemental measure of operating performance of equity REITs.  FFO should be evaluated along with GAAP net income (the most directly comparable GAAP measure), as well as cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, in evaluating the operating performance of equity REITs.  Management believes that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because this measure excludes the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time.  Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, this non-GAAP measure can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs.  FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in the Company's Statements of Cash Flows.  FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company's operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

Overview
The Company owns and operates office, retail and showroom properties with large concentrations of office and retail properties in the New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, D.C. and Northern Virginia area.  In addition, the Company has a 47.6% interest in an entity that owns and operates 85 cold storage warehouses nationwide and a 32.95% interest in Toys "R" Us, Inc. ("Toys") which has a significant real estate component, as well as other real estate and related investments.
The Company's business objective is to maximize shareholder value.  The Company measures its success in meeting this objective by the total return to its shareholders.  Below is a table comparing the Company's performance to the Morgan Stanley REIT Index ("RMS") for the following periods ending December 31, 2005:
(1)
         
Past performance is not necessarily indicative of how the Company will perform in the future.
(2)
         
From inception on July 25, 1995
The Company intends to achieve its business objective by continuing to pursue its investment philosophy and executing its operating strategies through:
Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;
                 
Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, D.C., where we believe there is high likelihood of capital appreciation;
                 
Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;
                 
Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area;
                 
Investing in fully-integrated operating companies that have a significant real estate component;
                 
Developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and
                 
Providing specialty financing to real estate related companies.
                 
The Company competes with a large number of real estate property owners and developers.  Principal factors of competition are rent charged, attractiveness of location and quality and breadth of services provided.  The Company's success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national and local economies, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.  Economic growth has been fostered, in part, by low interest rates, Federal tax cuts, and increases in government spending.  To the extent economic growth stalls, the Company may experience lower occupancy rates which may lead to lower initial rental rates, higher leasing costs and a corresponding decrease in net income, funds from operations and cash flow.  Alternatively, if economic growth is sustained, the Company may experience higher occupancy rates leading to higher initial rents and higher interest rates causing an increase in the Company's weighted average cost of capital and a corresponding effect on net income, funds from operations and cash flow.  The Company's net income and funds from operations will also be affected by the seasonality of the Toys' business and competition from discount and mass merchandisers.
2005 Acquisitions and Investments
On March 5, 2005, the Company acquired a 50% interest in a venture that owns Beverly Connection, a two-level urban shopping center, containing 322,000 square feet, located in Los Angeles, California for $10,700,000 in cash.  The Company also provided the venture with a $59,500,000 first mortgage loan which bore interest at 10% through its scheduled maturity in February 2006 and $35,000,000 of preferred equity yielding 13.5% for up to a three-year term, which is subordinate to $37,200,000 of other preferred equity and debt.  On February 11, 2006, $35,000,000 of the Company's loan to the venture was converted to additional preferred equity on the same terms as the Company's existing preferred equity.  The balance of the loan of $24,500,000 was extended to April 11, 2006 and bears interest at 10%. The shopping center is anchored by CompUSA, Old Navy and Sports Chalet.  The venture is redeveloping the existing retail and plans, subject to governmental approvals, to develop residential condominiums and assisted living facilities.  This investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  The Company records its pro rata share of net income or loss in Beverly Connection on a one-month lag basis as the Company files its consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time the venture reports its earnings.

Investment in H Street Building Corporation ("H Street")
On July 20, 2005, the Company acquired H Street, which owns directly or indirectly through stock ownership in corporations, a 50% interest in real estate assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia, including 34 acres of land leased to various residential and retail operators, a 1,670 unit apartment complex, 10 acres of land and two office buildings located in Washington, DC containing 577,000 square feet. The purchase price was approximately $246,600,000, consisting of $194,500,000 in cash and $52,100,000 for the Company's pro rata share of existing mortgage debt.  The operations of H Street are consolidated into the accounts of the Company from the date of acquisition.
The Company believes that the actions filed against the Company are without merit and that it will ultimately be successful in defending against them.
On July 22, 2005, two corporations owned 50% by H Street filed a complaint against the Company, H Street and three parties affiliated with the sellers of H Street in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia alleging that the Company encouraged H Street and the affiliated parties to breach their fiduciary duties to these corporations and interfered with prospective business and contractual relationships.  The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages and a rescission of the Company's acquisition of H Street.   In addition, on July 29, 2005, a tenant under a ground lease with one of these corporations brought a separate suit in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, alleging, among other things, that the Company's acquisition of H Street violated a provision giving them a right of first offer and on that basis seeks a rescission of the Company's acquisition and the right to acquire H Street for the price paid by the Company.  On September 12, 2005, the Company filed a complaint against each of these corporations and their acting directors seeking a restoration of H Street's full shareholder rights and damages.  These legal actions are currently in the discovery stage. 
In connection with these legal actions, the Company has accrued legal fees of $2,134,000 in the fourth quarter of 2005, which are included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of income. 
Because of the legal actions described above, the Company has not been granted access to the financial information of these two corporations and accordingly has not recorded its share of their net income or loss or disclosed its
pro rata share of their outstanding debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Investment in Toys "R" Us ("Toys")
On July 21, 2005, a joint venture owned equally by the Company, Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. acquired Toys for $26.75 per share in cash or approximately $6.6 billion.  In connection therewith, the Company invested $428,000,000 of the $1.3 billion of equity in the venture, consisting of $407,000,000 in cash and $21,000,000 in Toys common shares held by the Company.  This investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
The business of Toys is highly seasonal.  Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income.  Because Toys' fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31, the Company records its 32.95% share of Toys net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis.  Accordingly, the Company will record its share of Toys fourth quarter net income in its first quarter of 2006.  Equity in net loss from Toys for the period from July 21, 2005 (date of acquisition) through December 31, 2005 was $40,496,000, which consisted of (i) the Company's $1,977,000 share of Toys net loss in Toys' second quarter ended July 30, 2005 for the period from July 21, 2005 (date of acquisition) through July 30, 2005, (ii) the Company's $44,812,000 share of Toys net loss in Toys' third quarter ended October 29, 2005, partially offset by, (iii) $5,043,000 of interest income on the Company's senior unsecured bridge loan described below and (iv) $1,250,000 of management fees.
On August 29, 2005, the Company acquired $150,000,000 of the $1.9 billion one-year senior unsecured bridge loan financing provided to Toys.  The loan is senior to the acquisition equity of $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion of existing debt.  The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 5.25% (9.43% as of December 31, 2005) not to exceed 11% and provides for an initial ..375% placement fee and additional fees of .375% at the end of three and six months if the loan has not been repaid.  The loan is prepayable at any time without penalty.  On December 9, 2005, $73,184,000 of this loan was repaid to the Company.
On January 9, 2006, Toys announced plans and is in the process of closing 87 Toys "R" Us stores in the United States, of which twelve stores will be converted into Babies "R" Us stores, five leased properties are expiring and one has been sold.  Vornado is handling the leasing and disposition of the real estate of the remaining 69 stores.  As a result of the store-closing program, Toys will incur restructuring and other charges aggregating approximately $155,000,000 before tax, which includes $45,000,000 for the cost of liquidating the inventory.  Of this amount, approximately $99,000,000 will be recorded in Toys' fourth quarter ending January 28, 2006 and $56,000,000 will be recorded in the first quarter of their next fiscal year.  These estimated amounts are preliminary and remain subject to change.  The Company's 32.95% share of the $155,000,000 charge is $51,000,000, of which $36,000,000 will have no income statement effect as a result of purchase price accounting and the remaining portion relating to the cost of liquidating the inventory of approximately $9,000,000 after-tax, will be recorded as an expense in the first quarter of 2006.
The unaudited pro forma information set forth below presents the condensed consolidated statements of income for the Company for the three months and years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 (including Toys' results for the three and twelve months ended October 29, 2005 and October 30, 2004, respectively) as if the above transactions had occurred on November 1, 2003.   The unaudited pro forma information below is not necessarily indicative of what the Company's actual results would have been had the Toys transactions been consummated on November 1, 2003, nor does it represent the results of operations for any future periods.  In management's opinion, all adjustments necessary to reflect these transactions have been made.

Overview  continued
Investment in Sears, Roebuck and Co. ("Sears")
On March 30, 2005, upon consummation of the merger between Sears and Kmart, the Company received 370,330 common shares of Sears Holdings Corporation (Nasdaq:  SHLD) ("Sears Holdings") and $21,797,000 of cash in exchange for its 1,176,600 Sears common shares.  The Sears Holdings common shares were valued at $48,143,000, based on the March 30, 2005 closing share price of $130.00.  As a result the Company recognized a net gain of $27,651,000, the difference between the aggregate cost basis in the Sears shares and the market value of the total consideration received of $69,940,000.  On April 4, 2005, 99,393 of the Company's Sears Holdings common shares with a value of $13,975,000 were utilized to satisfy a third-party participation.  The remaining 270,937 Sears Holdings shares were sold in the fourth quarter of 2005 at a weighted average sales price of $125.83 per share, which resulted in a net loss on disposition of $1,137,000, based on the March 30, 2005 adjusted cost basis of $130.00 per share.  The Company's net gain on its investment in these Sears shares was $26,514,000.
In July and August 2004, the Company acquired an aggregate of 1,176,600 common shares of Sears, Roebuck and Co. ("Sears") for $41,945,000, an average price of $35.65 per share.
In August and September 2004, the Company acquired an economic interest in an additional 7,916,900 Sears common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which the Company purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on Sears common shares.  These call and put options had an initial weighted-average strike price of  $39.82 per share, or an aggregate of $315,250,000, expire in April 2006 and provide for net cash settlement.  Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points and is credited for the dividends received on the shares.  The options provide the Company with the same economic gain or loss as if it had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points.  Because these options are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the options at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in "interest and other investment income" on the Company's consolidated statement of income.
On March 30, 2005, as a result of the merger between Sears and Kmart and pursuant to the terms of the contract, the Company's derivative position representing 7,916,900 Sears common shares became a derivative position representing 2,491,819 common shares of Sears Holdings valued at $323,936,000 based on the then closing share price of $130.00 and $146,663,000 of cash.  As a result, the Company recognized a net gain of $58,443,000 based on the fair value of the derivative position on March 30, 2005.  During the fourth quarter of 2005, 402,660 of the common shares were sold at a weighted average sales price of $123.77 per share.

Investment in
McDonald's Corporation ("McDonalds") (NYSE: MCD)
In July 2005, the Company acquired an aggregate of 858,000 common shares of McDonalds for $25,346,000, an average price of $29.54 per share. These shares are recorded as marketable equity securities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and are classified as "available for sale."  Appreciation or depreciation in the fair market value of these shares is recorded as an increase or decrease in "accumulated other comprehensive income" in the shareholders' equity section of the Company's consolidated balance sheet and not recognized in income.  At December 31, 2005, based on McDonalds' closing stock price of $33.72 per share, $3,585,000 of appreciation in the value of these shares was included in "accumulated other comprehensive income."
During the three months ended September 30, 2005, the Company acquired an economic interest in an additional 14,565,000 McDonalds common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which the Company purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on McDonalds' common shares.  These call and put options have an initial weighted-average strike price of  $32.66 per share, or an aggregate of $475,692,000, expire on various dates between July 30, 2007 and September 10, 2007 and provide for net cash settlement.  Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points (up to 95 basis points under certain circumstances) and is credited for the dividends received on the shares.  The options provide the Company with the same economic gain or loss as if it had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points.  Because these options are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the options at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in "interest and other investment income" on the Company's consolidated statement of income.  During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded net income of $17,254,000, comprised of (i) $15,239,000 from the mark-to-market of the options on December 31, 2005, based on McDonalds' closing stock price of $33.72 per share, (ii) $9,759,000 of dividend income, partially offset by (iii) $7,744,000 for the increase in strike price resulting from the LIBOR charge.
Based on McDonalds' most recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company's aggregate investment in McDonalds represents 1.2% of McDonalds' outstanding common shares.
Other 2005 Acquisitions
In addition to the acquisitions and investments described above, the Company made $281,500,000 of other acquisitions and investments during 2005, which are summarized below:
(1)
         
On May 31, 2005, the Company contributed $50,000 in cash to Dune Capital L.P., a limited partnership involved in corporate, real estate and asset-based investments.  The Company's investment represented a 3.5% limited partnership interest for the period from May 31, 2005 through September 30, 2005.  On October 1, 2005, Dune Capital made a return of capital to one of its investors and the Company's ownership interest was effectively increased to 5.4%.  The Company initially accounted for this investment on the cost method based on its ownership interest on May 31, 2005.  Subsequent to October 1, 2005, the Company accounts for its investment on the equity method on a one-quarter lag basis. Dune Capital's financial statements are prepared on a market value basis and changes in value from one reporting period to the next are recognized in income.  Accordingly, the Company's share of Dune Capital's net income or loss will reflect such changes in market value.

Fascitelli, the Company's President, is a member of the Board of Trustees of GCT, effective August 10, 2005.  The Company records its pro-rata share of GMH's net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis as the Company files its financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time GMH files its financial statements.
The Company accounts for the warrants as derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  Accordingly, the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the warrants at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in "interest and other investment income" on the Company's consolidated statements of income.  In the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company recognized income of $14,079,000 and $24,190,000, respectively, from the mark-to-market of these warrants which were valued using a trinomial option pricing model based on GCT's closing stock price on the NYSE of $15.51 and $14.10 per share on December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
For Mr. Fascitelli's service as a Director, on August 10, 2005 he received 4,034 restricted common shares of GCT at a price of $14.33 per share.  These shares vest in equal installments over three years and are held by Mr. Fascitelli for the Company's benefit.

Critical Accounting Policies
In preparing the consolidated financial statements management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.   The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the Company's accounting policies included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Real Estate
 
Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.  As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, were $9.7 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.  Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components.  If the Company does not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimates the useful lives of its real estate, depreciation expense may be misstated.
 
Upon acquisitions of real estate, the Company assesses the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles such as acquired above and below market leases and acquired in-place leases and customer relationships) and acquired liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141: Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and allocates purchase price based on these assessments.  The Company assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property.  The Company's properties, including any related intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.  If the Company incorrectly estimates the values at acquisition or the undiscounted cash flows, initial allocations of purchase price and future impairment charges may be different.  The impact of the Company's estimates in connection with acquisitions and future impairment analysis could be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Identified Intangible Assets
Upon an acquisition of a business the Company records intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill.  The Company amortizes identified intangible assets that are determined to have finite lives which are based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired.  Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset, including the related real estate when appropriate, is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value.
As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets were $192,375,000 and $175,783,000, respectively.  Such amounts are included in "other assets" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  In addition, the Company had $150,892,000 and $70,205,000, of identified intangible liabilities as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, which are included in "deferred credit" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  If these assets are deemed to be impaired, or the estimated useful lives of finite-life intangibles assets or liabilities change, the impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements could be material.

Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable
The Company's policy is to record mortgages and notes receivable at the stated principal amount net of any discount or premium.  As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying amounts of Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable were $363,565,000 and $440,186,000, respectively.  The Company accretes or amortizes any discounts or premiums over the life of the related loan receivable utilizing the effective interest method.  The Company evaluates the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of its loans, if circumstances warrant, to determine whether it is impaired. A loan is considered to be impaired, when based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is considered to be impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loan's effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  The impact of the Company's estimates in connection with the collectibility of both interest and principal of its loans could be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Partially-Owned Entities
As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying amounts of investments and advances to partially-owned entities, including Alexander's and Toys "R" Us, were $1,369,853,000 and $605,300,000, respectively.  In determining whether the Company has a controlling interest in a partially-owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, it considers factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which it will absorb the majority of the entity's expected losses, if they occur, or receive the majority of the expected residual returns, if they occur, or both.  The Company accounts for investments on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met, and the Company has significant influence over the operations of the investee.  Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Company's share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions.  Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method.
The Company's investments in partially-owned entities are reviewed for impairment, periodically, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.  The ultimate realization of the Company's investments in partially-owned entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions.  The Company will record an impairment charge if it determines that a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary.
Allowance For Doubtful Accounts
The Company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts ($16,907,000 and $17,339,000 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004) for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their lease agreements.  The Company also maintains an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents ($6,051,000 and $6,787,000 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004).  This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements.  Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates.  These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition
The Company has the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:
Base Rents  income arising from tenant leases.  These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases.
                 
Percentage Rents  income arising from retail tenant leases which are contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold.  These rents are recognized in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104: Revenue Recognition, which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., sales thresholds have been achieved).
                 
Hotel Revenues  income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue.  Income is recognized when rooms are occupied.  Food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered.
                 
Trade Show Revenues  income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths.  This revenue is recognized in accordance with the booth rental contracts when the trade shows have occurred.
                 
Expense Reimbursements  revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property.  This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.
                 
Temperature Controlled Logistics revenue  income arising from the Company's investment in Americold Logistics.  Storage and handling revenue are recognized as services are provided.  Transportation fees are recognized upon delivery to customers.
                 
Management, Leasing and Other Fees  income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially-owned entities.  This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements.
                 
Before the Company recognizes revenue, it assesses, among other things, its collectibility.  If the Company's assessment of the collectibility of its revenue changes, the impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements could be material.
Income Taxes
The Company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT") under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. The Company intends to distribute to its shareholders 100% of its taxable income.  Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.  If the Company fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders, or fails to meet other REIT requirements, it may fail to qualify as a REIT and substantial adverse tax consequences may result.

Recently Issued Accounting Literature
On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 153, The amendments made by SFAS No. 153 are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. Further, the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have "commercial substance." SFAS No. 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 153 on its effective date did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets - An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29.
On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123: (Revised 2004) - ("SFAS No. 123R").  SFAS No. 123R replaces SFAS No. 123, which the Company adopted on January 1, 2003. SFAS No. 123R requires that the compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements and measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. SFAS No. 123R is effective as of the first annual reporting period beginning after December 31, 2005.  The Company has adopted SFAS No. 123R on a modified prospective method, effective January 1, 2006 and believes that the adoption will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
Share-Based Payment
In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47, , an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, .  FIN 47 provides clarification of the term "conditional asset retirement obligation" as used in SFAS 143, defined as a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the company.  Under this standard, a company must record a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated.  FIN 47 became effective in the Company's fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2005.  Certain of the Company's real estate assets contain asbestos.  Although the asbestos is appropriately contained, in accordance with current environmental regulations, the Company's practice is to remediate the asbestos upon the renovation or redevelopment of its properties.  Accordingly, the Company has determined that these assets meet the criteria for recording a liability and has recorded an asset retirement obligation aggregating approximately $8,400,000, which is included in "Other Liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005.  The cumulative effect of adopting this standard was approximately $2,500,000, and is included in "Depreciation and Amortization" on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations
Asset Retirement Obligations
In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,   SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle by requiring that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior periods' financial statements presented on the new accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to do so.  SFAS No. 154 also requires that a change in depreciation or amortization for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle and corrections of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a "restatement".  SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005.  The Company believes that the adoption of SFAS No. 154 will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections  A Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and SFAS No. 3.
In June 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") on Issue No. 04-05, "Determining Whether a General Partner, or General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights" ("EITF 04-05").  EITF 04-05 provides a framework for determining whether a general partner controls, and should consolidate, a limited partnership or a similar entity.  EITF 04-05 became effective on June 29, 2005, for all newly formed or modified limited partnership arrangements and January 1, 2006 for all existing limited partnership arrangements.  The Company believes that the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

Net income and EBITDA by Segment for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.
EBITDA represents "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization."  Management considers EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the un-levered performance of its segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity.  As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, management utilizes this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of its assets to that of its peers.  EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income.  EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.
 
Other EBITDA includes a net gain on sale of real estate of $31,614, income from the mark-to-market and conversion of derivative instruments of $72,816 and certain other gains and losses that affect comparability.  Excluding these items the percentages of EBITDA by segment are 55.0% for Office, 18.1% for Retail, 12.7% for Merchandise Mart, 6.6% for Temperature Controlled Logistics, 1.3% for Toys and 6.3% for Other.

At December 31, 2004, 7 West 34
th
 Street, a 440,000 square foot New York office building, was 100% occupied by four tenants, of which Health Insurance Plan of New York ("HIP") and Fairchild Publications occupied 255,000 and 146,000 square feet, respectively.  Effective January 4, 2005, the Company entered into a lease termination agreement with HIP under which HIP made an initial payment of $13,362 and is anticipated to make annual payments ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 over the remaining six years of the HIP lease contingent upon the level of operating expenses of the building in each year. In connection with the termination of the HIP lease, the Company wrote off the $2,462 balance of the HIP receivable arising from the straight-lining of rent.  In the first quarter of 2005, the Company began redevelopment of a portion of this property into a permanent showroom building for the giftware industry.  As of January 1, 2005, the Company transferred the operations and financial results related to the office component of this asset from the New York City Office division to the Merchandise Mart division for both the current and prior periods presented.  The operations and financial results related to the retail component of this asset were transferred to the Retail division for both current and prior periods presented.

Income Applicable to Alexander's
Income applicable to Alexander's (loan interest income, management, leasing, development and commitment fees, and equity in income) was $59,022,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $8,580,000 for the prior year, an increase of $50,442,000.  The increase is primarily due to (i) $30,895,000 for the Company's share of Alexander's after-tax net gain on sale of condominiums in the current year, (ii) a $16,236,000 decrease in the Company's share of Alexander's stock appreciation rights compensation ("SAR") expense, (iii) income from Alexander's 731 Lexington Avenue property which was placed into service subsequent to the third quarter of 2004, (iv) a $2,465,000 increase in development and guarantee fees, (v) a $1,399,000 increase in management and leasing fees, partially offset by, (vi) a $2,520,000 decrease in interest income on the Company's loans to Alexander's which were repaid in July 2005 and (vii) $1,274,000 for the Company's share of a gain on sale of land parcel in the prior year.
Loss Applicable to Toys R' Us
The business of Toys is highly seasonal.  Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income.  Because Toys' fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31, the Company records its 32.95% share of Toys net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis.  Accordingly, the Company will record its share of Toys' fourth quarter net income in its first quarter of 2006.  Equity in net loss from Toys for the period from July 21, 2005 (date of acquisition) through December 31, 2005 was $40,496,000 which consisted of (i) the Company's $1,977,000 share of Toys net loss in Toys' second quarter ended July 30, 2005 for the period from July 21, 2005 (date of acquisition) through July 30, 2005, (ii) the Company's $44,812,000 share of Toys net loss in Toys' third quarter ended October 29, 2005, partially offset by, (iii) $5,043,000 of interest income on the Company's senior unsecured bridge loan and (iv) $1,250,000 of management fees.

Interest and Other Investment Income
Interest and other investment income (interest income on mortgage loans receivable, other interest income and dividend income) was $167,220,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $203,998,000 in the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of $36,778,000.  This decrease resulted from the following:
 
Interest and Debt Expense
Interest and debt expense was $339,952,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $242,142,000 in the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $97,810,000.  This increase is primarily due to (i) $49,893,000 resulting from the consolidation of the Company's investment in Americold from November 18, 2004 versus accounting for the investment on the equity method previously, (ii) $26,199,000 from a 2.27% increase in the weighted average interest rate on variable rate debt, (iii) $15,335,000 of interest expense on the $500,000,000 exchangeable senior debentures issued in March 2005 and (iv) $6,881,000 of additional interest expense on the $250,000,000 senior unsecured notes due 2009, which were issued in August 2004.
Net Gain on Disposition of Wholly-owned and Partially-owned Assets other than Depreciable Real Estate
Net gain on disposition of wholly-owned and partially-owned assets other than depreciable real estate of $39,042,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 is comprised of (i) $25,346,000 of net gains on sales of marketable equity securities, of which $9,017,000 relates to the disposition of the Prime Group common shares, (ii) $12,110,000 for the net gain on disposition of the Company's senior preferred equity investment in 3700 Las Vegas Boulevard and (iii) $1,586,000 relates to net gains on sale of land parcels.  Net gain on disposition of wholly-owned and partially-owned assets other than depreciable real estate of $19,775,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily represents a $18,789,000 net gain on sale of a portion of the investment in Americold to Yucaipa.
Minority Interest of Partially-Owned Entities
Minority interest expense of partially-owned entities was $3,808,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $109,000 in the prior year, an increase of $3,699,000.  This increase resulted primarily from the consolidation of the Company's investment in Americold beginning on November 18, 2004 versus accounting for the investment on the equity method in the prior year.

On April 21, 2005, the Company, through its 85% joint venture, sold 400 North LaSalle, a 452-unit high-rise residential tower in Chicago, Illinois, for $126,000,000, which resulted in a net gain on sale after closing costs of $31,614,000.  All of the proceeds from the sale were reinvested in tax-free "like-kind" exchange investments pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code.
In anticipation of selling the Palisades Residential Complex, on February 27, 2004, the Company acquired the remaining 25% interest in the Palisades venture it did not previously own for approximately $17,000,000 in cash.  On June 29, 2004, the Company sold the Palisades for $222,500,000, which resulted in a net gain on sale after closing costs of $65,905,000.

Perpetual Preferred Unit Distributions of the Operating Partnership
Perpetual preferred unit distributions of the Operating Partnership were $67,119,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $69,108,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $1,989,000.  This decrease resulted primarily from the redemption of (i) $80,000,000 of the 8.25% Series D-3 preferred units in January 2005, (ii) $245,000,000 of the remaining 8.25% Series D-3 and D-4 preferred units in July 2005, (iii) $342,000,000 of the 8.25% Series D-5 and D-7 preferred units in September 2005 and (iv) $30,000,000 of the 8.25% Series D-6 and D-8 preferred units in December 2005, partially offset by,  (v) a $19,017,000 write-off of the issuance costs of the preferred units redeemed in 2005, and (vi) distributions to holders of the 7.20% Series D-11 and 6.55% Series D-12 units issued in May and December 2004.
Minority Limited Partners' Interest in the Operating Partnership
Minority limited partners' interest in the Operating Partnership was $66,755,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $88,091,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $21,336,000.  This decrease results primarily from a lower minority limited partnership ownership interest due to the conversion of Class A operating partnership units into common shares of the Company during 2004 and 2005, and lower net income subject to allocation to the minority limited partners.

EBITDA
Below are the details of the changes by segment in EBITDA.
(1)
                     
Represents operations which were owned for the same period in each year and excludes non-recurring income and expenses which are included in "acquisitions, dispositions and non-same store income and expenses" above.
(2)
                     
EBITDA and the same store percentage increase (decrease) were $341,601 and 4.3% for the New York City Office portfolio and $290,777 and (4.7%) for the Washington, D.C. Office portfolio.
(3)
                     
EBITDA and the same store percentage increase reflect the commencement of the WPP Group leases (228 square feet) in the third quarter of 2004 and the Chicago Sun Times lease (127 square feet) in the second quarter of 2004.  The same store percentage increase in EBITDA exclusive of these leases was 0.9%.
(4)
                     
Not comparable because prior to November 4, 2004, (date the operations of AmeriCold Logistics were combined with Americold Realty Trust), the Company reflected its equity in the rent Americold received from AmeriCold Logistics.  Subsequent thereto, the Company consolidates the operations of the combined company.  See page 53 for condensed pro forma operating results of Americold for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, giving effect to the acquisition of its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, as if it had occurred on January 1, 2004.  The same store percentage increase on a pro forma basis for the combined company is 14.2%.
(5)
                     
The business of Toys is highly seasonal.  Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income.  Because Toys' fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31, the Company records its 32.95% share of Toys net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis.  Accordingly, the Company will record its share of Toys fourth quarter net income in its first quarter of 2006.  Toys EBITDA above includes (i) the Company's share of Toy's EBITDA for the period from July 21, 2005 (date of acquisition) through October 29, 2005, (ii) $5,043,000 of interest income on the Company's senior unsecured bridge loan and (iii) $1,250,000 of management fees.

The Company's revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarter-by-quarter net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations.  The business of Toys is highly seasonal.  Historically, Toys' fourth quarter net income, which the Company records on a one-quarter lag basis in its first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of Toys' fiscal year net income.  The Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the third quarter of the year.  The Merchandise Mart segment also has experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters.  The Retail segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage rental income.  The Temperature Controlled Logistics segment has experienced higher earnings in the fourth quarter due to higher activity and occupancy in its warehouse operations due to the holiday season's impact on the food industry.
Below are the details of the changes by segment in EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2005 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2005:

Investment in Americold Realty Trust
Prior to November 18, 2004, the Company owned a 60% interest in Vornado Crescent Portland Partnership ("VCPP") which owned Americold Realty Trust ("Americold").  Americold owned 88 temperature controlled warehouses, all of which were leased to AmeriCold Logistics.  On November 4, 2004, Americold purchased its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, for $47,700,000 in cash.  On November 18, 2004, the Company and its 40% partner, Crescent Real Estate Equities Company ("CEI") collectively sold 20.7% of Americold's common shares to The Yucaipa Companies ("Yucaipa") for $145,000,000, which resulted in a gain, of which the Company's share was $18,789,000. The sale price was based on a $1.450 billion valuation for Americold before debt and other obligations.  Yucaipa is a private equity firm with significant expertise in the food distribution, logistics and retail industries.  Upon closing of the sale to Yucaipa on November 18, 2004, Americold is owned 47.6% by the Company, 31.7% by CEI and 20.7% by Yucaipa.
Pursuant to the sales agreement: (i) Yucaipa may be entitled to receive up to 20% of the increase in the value of Americold, realized through the sale of a portion of the Company's and CEI's interests in Americold subject to limitations, provided that Americold's Threshold EBITDA, as defined, exceeds $133,500,000 at December 31, 2007; (ii) the annual asset management fee payable by CEI to the Company has been reduced from approximately $5,500,000 to $4,548,000, payable quarterly through October 30, 2027.  CEI, at its option, may terminate the payment of this fee at any time after November 2009, by paying the Company a termination fee equal to the present value of the remaining payments through October 30, 2027, discounted at 10%.  In addition, CEI is obligated to pay a pro rata portion of the termination fee to the extent it sells a portion of its equity interest in Americold; and (iii) VCPP was dissolved.  The Company has the right to appoint three of the five members to Americold's Board of Trustees.  Consequently, the Company is deemed to exercise control over Americold and, on November 18, 2004, the Company began to consolidate the operations and financial position of Americold into its accounts and no longer accounts for its investment on the equity method.
The following is a pro forma presentation of the results of operations of Americold for the three months and year ended December 31, 2004, giving effect to the acquisition of AmeriCold Logistics as if it had occurred on January 1, 2004 as compared to the actual results for the comparable periods in the current year.
 
The Company's actual share of net income and EBITDA for 2005 and pro forma share for 2004 are as follows:
(1)
               
Amounts reported by the Company for the three months and year ended December 31, 2005 include asset management fees of $1,010 and $4,832, respectively, which are not included in the above table.
(2)
               
Actual results reported by the Company for these periods was based on a 60% ownership interest through November 18, 2004, as compared to the pro forma ownership interest of 47.6% used in the above table.  In addition, the Company earned asset management fees for the three months and year ended December 31, 2004 of $1,310 and $5,824, which are not included in the above table.

Related Party Transactions
Loan and Compensation Agreements
On December 22, 2005, Steven Roth, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, repaid to the Company his $13,122,500 outstanding loan which was scheduled to mature in January 2006.  Pursuant to a credit agreement dated November 1999, Mr. Roth may draw up to $15,000,000 of loans from the Company on a revolving basis.  Each loan bears interest, payable quarterly, at the applicable Federal rate on the date the loan is made and matures on the sixth anniversary of such loan.  Loans are collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the amount outstanding.  On December 23, 2005, Mr. Roth borrowed $13,122,500 under this facility, which bears interest at 4.45% per annum and matures on December 23, 2011.
At December 31, 2005, the balance of the loan due from Michael Fascitelli, the Company's President, in accordance with his employment agreement was $8,600,000.  The loan matures in December 2006 and bears interest, payable quarterly, at a weighted average rate of 3.97% (based on the applicable Federal rate).
Effective January 1, 2002, the Company extended its employment agreement with Mr. Fascitelli for a five-year period through December 31, 2006.  Pursuant to the extended employment agreement, Mr. Fascitelli is entitled to receive a deferred payment on December 31, 2006 of 626,566 Vornado common shares which are valued for compensation purposes at $27,500,000 (the value of the shares on March 8, 2002, the date the extended employment agreement was executed).  The shares are held in a rabbi trust for the benefit of Mr. Fascitelli and vested 100% on December 31, 2002.  The extended employment agreement does not permit diversification, allows settlement of the deferred compensation obligation by delivery of these shares only, and permits the deferred delivery of these shares.  The value of these shares was amortized ratably over the one-year vesting period as compensation expense.
Pursuant to the Company's annual compensation review in February 2002 with Joseph Macnow, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, the Compensation Committee approved a $2,000,000 loan to Mr. Macnow, bearing interest at the applicable federal rate of 4.65% per annum and due in June 2007.  The loan was funded on July 23, 2002 and is collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the loan amount.
On February 22, 2005, the Company and Sandeep Mathrani, Executive Vice President  Retail Division, entered into a new employment agreement.  Pursuant to the agreement, the Company granted Mr. Mathrani (i) 16,836 restricted shares of the Company's stock, (ii) stock options to acquire 300,000 of the Company's common shares at an exercise price of $71.275 per share and (iii) the right to receive 200,000 stock options over the next two years at the then prevailing market price.  In addition, Mr. Mathrani repaid the $500,000 loan the Company provided him under his prior employment agreement.
On March 11, 2004, the Company loaned $2,000,000 to Melvyn Blum, an executive officer of the Company, pursuant to the revolving credit facility contained in his January 2000 employment agreement.  Melvyn Blum resigned effective July 15, 2005.  In accordance with the terms of his employment agreement, his $2,000,000 outstanding loan as of June 30, 2005 was repaid on August 14, 2005.
Transactions with Affiliates and Officers and Trustees of the Company
Alexander's
The Company owns 33% of Alexander's.  Mr. Roth and Mr. Fascitelli are officers and directors of Alexander's, the Company provides various services to Alexander's in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements.  These agreements are described in Note 5 - Investments in Partially-Owned Entities to the Company's consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K.
On December 29, 2005, Michael Fascitelli, the Company's President and President of Alexander's, exercised 350,000 of his Alexander's stock appreciation rights ("SARs") which were scheduled to expire in December 2006 and received $173.82 for each SAR exercised, representing the difference between Alexander's stock price of $247.70 (the average of the high and low market price) on the date of exercise and the exercise price of $73.88.  This exercise was consistent with Alexander's tax planning.
On January 10, 2006, the Omnibus Stock Plan Committee of the Board of Directors of Alexander's granted Mr. Fascitelli a SAR covering 350,000 shares of Alexander's common stock.  The exercise price of the SAR is $243.83 per share of common stock, which was the average of the high and low trading price of Alexander's common stock on date of grant.  The SAR will become exercisable on July 10, 2006, provided Mr. Fascitelli is employed with Alexander's on such date, and will expire on March 14, 2007.  Mr. Fascitelli's early exercise and Alexander's related tax consequences were factors in Alexander's decision to make the new grant to him.

Interstate Properties
As of December 31, 2005, Interstate Properties and its partners beneficially owned approximately 9.2% of the common shares of beneficial interest of the Company and 27.7% of Alexander's common stock.  Interstate Properties is a general partnership in which Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the partners.  Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the managing general partner of Interstate Properties, and the Chief Executive Officer and a director of Alexander's.  Messrs. Mandelbaum and Wight are trustees of the Company and also directors of Alexander's.
The Company manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate Properties pursuant to a management agreement for which the Company receives an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent.  The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days' notice at the end of the term. The Company believes based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies that its terms are fair to the Company.  The Company earned $791,000, $726,000 and $703,000 of management fees under the management agreement for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.  In addition, during fiscal year 2003, as a result of a previously existing leasing arrangement with Alexander's, Alexander's paid to Interstate $587,000, for the leasing and other services actually rendered by the Company.  Upon receipt of these payments, Interstate promptly paid them over to the Company without retaining any interest therein.  This arrangement was terminated at the end of 2003 and all payments by Alexander's thereafter for these leasing and other services are made directly to the Company.
Vornado Operating Company ("Vornado Operating")
In October 1998, Vornado Operating was spun off from the Company in order to own assets that the Company could not itself own and conduct activities that the Company could not itself conduct.  Vornado Operating's primary asset was its 60% investment in AmeriCold Logistics, which leased 88 refrigerated warehouses from Americold, owned 60% by the Company.  On November 4, 2004, Americold purchased its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, for $47,700,000 in cash.  As part of this transaction, Vornado Operating repaid the $21,989,000 balance of its loan to the Company as well as $4,771,000 of unpaid interest.  Because the Company fully reserved for the interest income on this loan beginning in January 2002, it recognized $4,771,000 of income upon collection in the fourth quarter 2004.
On March 22, 2005, the Court approved the settlement.
In November 2004, a class action shareholder derivative lawsuit was brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Vornado Operating, its directors and the Company.  The lawsuit sought to enjoin the dissolution of Vornado Operating, rescind the previously completed sale of AmeriCold Logistics (owned 60% by Vornado Operating) to Americold (owned 60% by the Company) and damages.  In addition, the plaintiffs claimed that the Vornado Operating directors breached their fiduciary duties.  On November 24, 2004, a stipulation of settlement was entered into under which the Company agreed to settle the lawsuit with a payment of approximately $4,500,000 or about $1 per Vornado Operating share or partnership unit before litigation expenses. The Company accrued the proposed settlement payment and related legal costs as part of "general and administrative expense" in the fourth quarter of 2004.

On August 4, 2003, the Company completed the acquisition of 2101 L Street, a 370,000 square foot office building located in Washington D.C.  The consideration for the acquisition consisted of approximately 1.1 million newly issued Operating Partnership units (valued at approximately $49,517,000) and the assumption of existing mortgage debt and transaction costs totaling approximately $32,000,000.  Robert H. Smith and Robert P.

The partnership units were issued to Mitchell N. Schear, one of the partners in the Waterfront interest, and the President of the Company's CESCR division.
On July 1, 2004, the Company acquired the Marriott hotel located in its Crystal City office complex from a limited partnership in which Robert H. Smith and Robert P. Kogod, trustees of the Company, together with family members, own approximately 67 percent.  The purchase price of $21,500,000 was paid in cash.  The hotel contains 343 rooms and is leased to an affiliate of Marriott International, Inc. until July 31, 2015, with one 10-year extension option.  The land under the hotel was acquired in 1999.
On October 1, 2004, the Company increased its ownership interest in the Investment Building in Washington, D.C. to 5% by acquiring an additional 2.8% interest for $2,240,000 in cash.  The Company's original interest in the property was acquired in connection with the acquisition of the Kaempfer Company in April 2003.  Mitchell N. Schear, President of the Company's Washington, D.C. Office division and other former members of Kaempfer management were also partners in the Investment Building partnership.
On December 20, 2005, the Company acquired a 46% partnership interest in, and became co-general partner of, partnerships that own a complex in Rosslyn, Virginia, containing four office buildings with an aggregate of 714,000 square feet and two apartment buildings containing 195 rental units.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company anticipates that cash from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund its business operations, dividends to shareholders and distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership and recurring capital expenditures, and together with existing cash balances, will be greater than its anticipated cash requirements, including development and redevelopment expenditures and debt amortization.  Capital requirements for significant acquisitions may require funding from borrowings or equity offerings.
The Company's believes that it has complied with the financial covenants required by its revolving credit facility and its senior unsecured notes due 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2025, and that as of December 31, 2005, it has the ability to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness.  As at December 31, 2005, the Company has an effective shelf registration under which the Company can offer an aggregate of approximately $836,750,000 of equity securities and Vornado Realty L.P. can offer an aggregate of $4,510,000,000 of debt securities.
Certain Future Cash Requirements
For 2006 the Company has budgeted approximately $173,500,000 for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions as follows:
(1)
         
Americold, Hotel Pennsylvania, Paramus Office and Warehouses.
(2)
         
Tenant improvements and leasing commissions per square foot budgeted for 2006 leasing activity are $33.75 ($5.80 per annum) and $10.00 ($1.90 per annum) for Merchandise Mart office and showroom space, respectively.
In addition to the capital expenditures reflected above, the Company is currently engaged in certain development and redevelopment projects for which it has budgeted approximately $718,500,000.  Of this amount, $228,000,000 is estimated to be expended in 2006.
The table above excludes the anticipated 2006 capital expenditures of Alexander's, Newkirk MLP, Toys "R" Us or any other partially-owned entity that is not consolidated by the Company, as these entities are expected to fund their own cash requirements without additional equity contributions from the Company.

Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations
Below is a schedule of the Company's contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005.
 
At December 31, 2005, the Company's $600,000,000 revolving credit facility, which expires in July 2006, had a zero outstanding balance and $22,311,000 was reserved for outstanding letters of credit. This facility contains financial covenants, which require the Company to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization, and provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in the Company's ratings below Baa3/BBB.  At December 31, 2005, Americold's $30,000,000 revolving credit facility had a $9,076,000 outstanding balance and $17,000,000 was reserved for outstanding letters of credit.  This facility requires Americold to maintain, on a trailing four-quarter basis, a minimum of $30,000,000 of free cash flow, as defined.  Both of these facilities contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.
On March 29, 2005, the Company completed a public offering of $500,000,000 principal amount of 3.875% exchangeable senior debentures due 2025 pursuant to an effective registration statement.  The notes were sold at 98.0% of their principal amount.  The net proceeds from this offering, after the underwriters' discount were approximately $490,000,000.  The debentures are exchangeable, under certain circumstances, for common shares of the Company at a current exchange rate of 11.062199 (initial exchange rate of 10.9589) common shares per $1,000 of principal amount of debentures.  The Company may elect to settle any exchange right in cash.  The debentures permit the Company to increase its common dividend 5% per annum, cumulatively, without an increase to the exchange rate.  The debentures are redeemable at the Company's option beginning in 2012 for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.  Holders of the debentures have the right to require the issuer to repurchase their debentures in 2012, 2015 and 2020 and in the event of a change in control.
expenditures to be funded over the next six years at the Springfield Mall, in which it has a 97.5% interest.
The Company has made acquisitions and investments in partially-owned entities for which it is committed to fund additional capital aggregating $40,800,000.  Of this amount, $25,000,000 relates to capital
n November 10, 2005, the Company committed to fund up to $30,530,000 of the junior portion of a $173,000,000 construction loan to an entity developing a mix-use building complex in Boston, Massachusetts, at the north end of the Boston Harbor.  The Company will earn current-pay interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 11%.  The loan will mature in November 2008, with a one-year extension option.  The Company anticipates funding all or portions of the loan beginning in 2006.
In addition to the above, o

The Company carries comprehensive liability and all risk property insurance ((i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended coverage, (iv) "acts of terrorism" as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 which expires in 2007 and (v) rental loss insurance) with respect to its assets.  Below is a summary of the current all risk property insurance and terrorism risk insurance in effect through September 2006 for each of the following business segments:
(1)
                     
Limited as to terrorism insurance by the sub-limit shown in the adjacent column.
In addition to the coverage above, the Company carries lesser amounts of coverage for terrorist acts not covered by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005.
The Company's debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by its properties (which are generally non-recourse to the Company), its senior unsecured notes due 2007, 2009 and 2010, its exchangeable senior debentures due 2025 and its revolving credit agreements, contain customary covenants requiring the Company to maintain insurance.  Although the Company believes that it has adequate insurance coverage under these agreements, the Company may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future.  Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than the Company is able to obtain, or if the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 is not extended past 2007, it could adversely affect the Company's ability to finance and/or refinance its properties and expand its portfolio.
Each of the Company's properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to the Company.
On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey ("USDC-NJ") claiming the Company has no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty.  On May 17, 2005, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment.  On July 15, 2005, Stop & Shop opposed the Company's motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.  On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denying the motions for summary judgment.  The Company intends to pursue its claims against Stop & Shop vigorously.  There are various other legal actions against the Company in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.
The Company enters into agreements for the purchase and resale of U.S. government obligations for periods of up to one week. The obligations purchased under these agreements are held in safekeeping in the name of the Company by various money center banks. The Company has the right to demand additional collateral or return of these invested funds at any time the collateral value is less than 102% of the invested funds plus any accrued earnings thereon.  The Company had $177,650,000 and $23,110,000 of cash invested in these agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
From time to time, the Company has disposed of substantial amounts of real estate to third parties for which, as to certain properties, it remains contingently liable for rent payments or mortgage indebtedness that cannot be quantified by the Company.

Funds From Operations ("FFO")
FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT").  NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus specified non-cash items, such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity REITs.  FFO and FFO per diluted share should be evaluated along with GAAP net income and income per diluted share (the most directly comparable GAAP measures), as well as cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, in evaluating the operating performance of equity REITs.  Management believes that FFO and FFO per diluted share are helpful to investors as supplemental performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time.  Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, these non-GAAP measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs.  FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in the Company's Statements of Cash Flows.  FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company's operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.   The calculations of both the numerator and denominator used in the computation of income per share are disclosed in Note 16 - Income per Share, in the Company's notes to consolidated financial statements on page 123 of this Form 8-K.
FFO applicable to common shares plus assumed conversions was $757,219,000, or $5.21 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $750,043,000, or $5.63 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2004.  FFO applicable to common shares plus assumed conversions was $194,101,000 or $1.26 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2005, compared to $299,441,000, or $2.22 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2004.

The Company records its 32.95% share of Toys FFO or negative FFO on a one-quarter lag basis.  FFO for the three months and year ended December 31, 2005, includes the Company's 32.95% share of Toys' negative FFO of $33,376,000 or $0.20 per share and $32,918,000 or $0.20 per share, respectively, and certain items that affect comparability as detailed in the table below.  Before these items and the Company's share of Toys results, FFO per share is 1.0% lower than the prior year and is 0.8% higher than the prior year's quarter.

2.    Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vornado Realty Trust and its majority-owned subsidiary, Vornado Realty L.P.  All significant intercompany amounts have been eliminated.  The Company accounts for its unconsolidated partially-owned entities on the equity method of accounting.  See below for further details of the Company's accounting policies regarding partially-owned entities.
The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
Significant Accounting Policies
Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.  Betterments, major renewals and certain costs directly related to the acquisition, improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.  For redevelopment of existing operating properties, the net book value of the existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for the construction and improvements incurred in connection with the redevelopment are capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the property do not exceed the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property when complete.  If the cost of the redeveloped property, including the undepreciated net book value of the property carried forward, exceeds the estimated fair value of redeveloped property, the excess is charged to expense.  Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the assets' estimated useful lives which range from 7 to 40 years.  Tenant allowances are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which approximates the useful lives of the assets.  Additions to real estate include interest expense capitalized during construction of $15,582,000 and $8,718,000, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Real Estate:  
Upon acquisitions of real estate, the Company assesses the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, and identified intangibles such as above and below market leases and acquired in-place leases and customer relationships) and acquired liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141: Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and allocates purchase price based on these assessments.  The Company assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property.  The Company's properties, including any related intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.
The Company considers APB 18: The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, SOP 78-9: Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures, Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") 96-16: Investors Accounting for an Investee When the Investor has the Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Partners have Certain Approval or Veto Rights and FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised 2003): Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities  An Interpretation of ARB No. 51 ("FIN 46R"), to determine the method of accounting for each of its partially-owned entities.  In determining whether the Company has a controlling interest in a partially-owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, it considers factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which it will absorb the majority of the entity's expected losses, if they occur, or receive the majority of the expected residual returns, if they occur, or both.  The Company has concluded that it does not control a partially-owned entity, despite an ownership interest of 50% or greater, if the entity is not considered a variable interest entity and the approval of all of the partners/members is contractually required with respect to major decisions, such as operating and capital budgets, the sale, exchange or other disposition of real property, the hiring of a chief executive officer, the commencement, compromise or settlement of any lawsuit, legal proceeding or arbitration or the placement of new or additional financing secured by assets of the venture.  This is the case with respect to the Company's 50% interests in Monmouth Mall, MartParc Wells, MartParc Orleans, H Street, Beverly Connection, 478-486 Broadway, 968 Third Avenue and 825 Seventh Avenue.

2.    Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies  continued
Upon an acquisition of a business the Company records intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill.  The Company amortizes identified intangible assets that are determined to have finite lives which are based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired.  Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value.
Identified Intangible Assets and Goodwill:  
The excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired (including identified intangible assets) and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.  Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.  An impairment loss for an asset group is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro-rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, unless the fair value of specific components of the reporting group are determinable without undue cost and effort.
As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying amounts of the Company's identified intangible assets are $192,375,000 and $175,783,000 and the carrying amounts of goodwill are $11,122,000 and $10,425,000, respectively.  Such amounts are included in "other assets" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  In addition, the Company has $150,892,000 and $70,205,000 of identified intangible liabilities as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, which are included in "deferred credit" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
   Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents do not include cash escrowed under loan agreements and cash restricted in connection with an officer's deferred compensation payable.  Cash and cash equivalents include repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government obligations totaling $177,650,000 and $23,110,000 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  The majority of the Company's cash and cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks which may at times exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit of $100,000.  The Company has not experienced any losses to date on its invested cash.
Cash and Cash Equivalents:
The Company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreements.  The Company also maintains an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents.  This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements.  Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:  
   The Company classifies debt and equity securities which it intends to hold for an indefinite period of time as securities available-for-sale; equity securities it intends to buy and sell on a short term basis as trading securities; and mandatory redeemable preferred stock investments as securities held to maturity.  Unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings.  Unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale are included as a component of shareholders' equity and other comprehensive income.  Realized gains or losses on the sale of securities are recorded based on specific identification.  A portion of the Company's preferred stock investments are accounted for in accordance with EITF 99-20: Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets.  Income is recognized by applying the prospective method of adjusting the yield to maturity based on an estimate of future cash flows.  If the value of the investment based on the present value of the future cash flows is less than the Company's carrying amount, the investments will be written-down to fair value through earnings.  Investments in non-publicly traded securities are reported at cost, as they are not considered marketable under SFAS No. 115: Accounting For Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.
Marketable Securities:
At December 31, 2005 and 2004, marketable securities had an aggregate cost of $132,536,000 and $135,382,000 and an aggregate fair value of $276,146,000 and $185,394,000, of which $272,949,000 and $178,999,000 represents securities available for sale; and $3,197,000 and $6,395,000 represent securities held to maturity.  Unrealized gains and losses were $90,210,000 and $1,046,000 at December 31, 2005 and $50,012,000 and $0 at December 31, 2004.

   The Company's policy is to record notes and mortgage loans receivable at the stated principal amount less any discount or premium.  The Company accretes or amortizes any discounts or premiums over the life of the related loan receivable utilizing the straight-line method which approximates the effective interest method.  The Company evaluates the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of its loans, if circumstances warrant, to determine whether it is impaired. A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is considered to be impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loan's effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable:
   Direct financing costs are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related agreements as a component of interest expense. Direct costs related to leasing activities are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases. All other deferred charges are amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method, in accordance with the terms of the agreements to which they relate.
Deferred Charges:
   The Company has estimated the fair value of all financial instruments reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at amounts which are based upon an interpretation of available market information and valuation methodologies (including discounted cash flow analyses with regard to fixed rate debt).  The fair value of the Company's debt is approximately $50,058,000 and $256,518,000 in excess of the aggregate carrying amounts at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  Such fair value estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized upon disposition of the Company's financial instruments.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
SFAS No. 133: Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ("SFAS No. 133"), as amended and interpreted, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities.  As required by SFAS No. 133, the Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
Derivative Instruments And Hedging Activities:  
For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (loss) (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings.  The Company assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction. For derivatives not designated as hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.

  The Company has the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:
Revenue Recognition:
Base Rents  income arising from tenant leases.  These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases.
Percentage Rents  income arising from retail tenant leases which are contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold.  These rents are recognized in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104: Revenue Recognition, which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., sales thresholds have been achieved).
Hotel Revenues  income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue.  Income is recognized when rooms are occupied.  Food and beverage and banquet revenue is recognized when the services have been rendered.
Trade Show Revenues  income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths.  This revenue is recognized in accordance with the booth rental contracts when the trade shows have occurred.
Expense Reimbursements  revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property.  This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.  Contingent rents are not recognized until realized.
Temperature Controlled Logistics revenue  income arising from the Company's investment in Americold.  Storage and handling revenue are recognized as services are provided.  Transportation fees are recognized upon delivery to customers.
Management, Leasing and Other Fees  income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially-owned entities.  This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements.
The Company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.  The Company will distribute to its shareholders 100% of its taxable income and therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. Dividend distributions for the year ended December 31, 2005 were characterized for Federal income tax purposes as 93.6% ordinary income and 6.4% long-term capital gain income.  Dividend distributions for the year ended December 31, 2004 were characterized for Federal income tax purposes as 94.8% ordinary income and 5.2% long-term capital gain income.  Dividend distributions for the year ended December 31, 2003 were characterized for Federal income tax purposes as 94.5% ordinary income and 5.5% long-term capital gain income.
Income Taxes:
The Company owns stock in corporations that have elected to be treated for Federal income tax purposes, as taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS").  The value of the combined TRS stock cannot and does not exceed 20% of the value of the Company's total assets.  A TRS is taxable on its net income at regular corporate tax rates.  The total income tax paid in the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $8,672,000, $1,867,000 and $2,048,000, respectively.
The following table reconciles net income to estimated taxable income for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.
 
The net basis of the Company's assets and liabilities for tax purposes is approximately $3,231,076,000 lower than the amount reported for financial statement purposes.

   Basic income per share is computed based on weighted average shares outstanding.  Diluted income per share considers the effect of outstanding options, restricted shares, warrants and convertible or redeemable securities.
Income Per Share:
   In 2002 and prior years, the Company accounted for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method. Under the intrinsic value method compensation cost is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the Company's stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the option granted. Compensation cost for stock options, if any, is recognized ratably over the vesting period.  The Company's policy is to grant options with an exercise price equal to 100% of the market price of the Company's stock on the grant date. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the Company's stock option grants.  Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123: Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148: Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure and as revised by SFAS No. 123R: Share-Based Payment.  The Company adopted SFAS No. 123 prospectively by valuing and accounting for employee stock options granted in 2003 and thereafter.  The Company utilizes a binomial valuation model and appropriate market assumptions to determine the value of each grant.  Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for all grants subsequent to 2002.  See Note 10. Stock-Based Compensation, for pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, assuming compensation costs for grants prior to 2003 were recognized as compensation expense based on the fair value at the grant dates.
Stock-Based Compensation:
In addition to employee stock option grants, the Company has also granted restricted shares to certain of its employees that vest over a three to five year period.  The Company records the value of each restricted share award as stock-based compensation expense based on the Company's closing stock price on the NYSE on the date of grant on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  As of December 31, 2005, the Company has 260,267 restricted shares or rights to receive restricted shares outstanding to employees of the Company, excluding 626,566 shares issued to the Company's President in connection with his employment agreement.  The Company recognized $3,559,000, $4,200,000 and $3,239,000 of stock-based compensation expense in the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 for the portion of these shares that vested during each year.  Dividends paid on unvested shares are charged to retained earnings and amounted to $1,038,000, $938,700 and $777,700 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Dividends on shares that are canceled or terminated prior to vesting are charged to compensation expense in the period they are cancelled or terminated.

Recently Issued Accounting Literature
On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 153, The amendments made by SFAS No. 153 are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. Further, the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have "commercial substance." SFAS No. 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 153 on its effective date did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets - An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29.
On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123: (Revised 2004) - ("SFAS No. 123R").  SFAS No. 123R replaces SFAS No. 123, which the Company adopted on January 1, 2003. SFAS No. 123R requires that the compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements and measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. SFAS No. 123R is effective as of the first annual reporting period beginning after December 31, 2005.  The Company has adopted SFAS No. 123R on a modified prospective method, effective January 1, 2006 and believes that the adoption will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
Share-Based Payment
In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47, , an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, .  FIN 47 provides clarification of the term "conditional asset retirement obligation" as used in SFAS 143, defined as a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the company.  Under this standard, a company must record a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated.  FIN 47 became effective in the Company's fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2005.  Certain of the Company's real estate assets contain asbestos.  Although the asbestos is appropriately contained, in accordance with current environmental regulations, the Company's practice is to remediate the asbestos upon the renovation or redevelopment of its properties.  Accordingly, the Company has determined that these assets meet the criteria for recording a liability and has recorded an asset retirement obligation aggregating approximately $8,400,000, which is included in "Other Liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005.  The cumulative effect of adopting this standard was approximately $2,500,000, and is included in "Depreciation and Amortization" on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations
Asset Retirement Obligations
In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,   SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle by requiring that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior periods' financial statements presented on the new accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to do so.  SFAS No. 154 also requires that a change in depreciation or amortization for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle and corrections of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a "restatement".  SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005.  The Company believes that the adoption of SFAS No. 154 will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections
A Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and SFAS No. 3.
In June 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") on Issue No. 04-05, "Determining Whether a General Partner, or General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights" ("EITF 04-05").  EITF 04-05 provides a framework for determining whether a general partner controls, and should consolidate, a limited partnership or a similar entity.  EITF 04-05 became effective on June 29, 2005, for all newly formed or modified limited partnership arrangements and January 1, 2006 for all existing limited partnership arrangements.  The Company believes that the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

The Company believes that the actions filed against the Company are without merit and that it will ultimately be successful in defending against them.
On July 22, 2005, two corporations owned 50% by H Street filed a complaint against the Company, H Street and three parties affiliated with the sellers of H Street in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia alleging that the Company encouraged H Street and the affiliated parties to breach their fiduciary duties to these corporations and interfered with prospective business and contractual relationships.  The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages and a rescission of the Company's acquisition of H Street.   In addition, on July 29, 2005, a tenant under a ground lease with one of these corporations brought a separate suit in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, alleging, among other things, that the Company's acquisition of H Street violated a provision giving them a right of first offer and on that basis seeks a rescission of the Company's acquisition and the right to acquire H Street for the price paid by the Company.  On September 12, 2005, the Company filed a complaint against each of these corporations and their acting directors seeking a restoration of H Street's full shareholder rights and damages.  These legal actions are currently in the discovery stage. 
In connection with these legal actions, the Company has accrued legal fees of $2,134,000 in the fourth quarter of 2005, which are included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of income. 
Because of the legal actions described above, the Company has not been granted access to the financial information of these two corporations and accordingly has not recorded its share of their net income or loss or disclosed its
pro rata share of their outstanding debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Toys "R" Us, Inc. ("Toys")
On July 21, 2005, a joint venture owned equally by the Company, Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. acquired Toys for $26.75 per share in cash or approximately $6.6 billion.  In connection therewith, the Company invested $428,000,000 of the $1.3 billion of equity in the venture, consisting of $407,000,000 in cash and $21,000,000 in Toys common shares held by the Company.  This investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
The business of Toys is highly seasonal.  Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income.  Because Toys' fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31, the Company records its 32.95% share of Toys net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis.  Accordingly, the Company will record its share of Toys fourth quarter net income in its first quarter of 2006.  Equity in net loss from Toys for the period from July 21, 2005 (date of acquisition) through December 31, 2005 was $40,496,000 which consisted of (i) the Company's $1,977,000 share of Toys net loss in Toys' second quarter ended July 30, 2005 for the period from July 21, 2005 (date of acquisition) through July 30, 2005, (ii) the Company's $44,812,000 share of Toys net loss in Toys' third quarter ended October 29, 2005, partially offset by, (iii) $5,043,000 of interest income on the Company's senior unsecured bridge loan described below and (iv) $1,250,000 of management fees.
On August 29, 2005, the Company acquired $150,000,000 of the $1.9 billion one-year senior unsecured bridge loan financing provided to Toys.  The loan is senior to the acquisition equity of $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion of existing debt.  The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 5.25% (9.43% as of December 31, 2005) not to exceed 11% and provides for an initial ..375% placement fee and additional fees of .375% at the end of three and six months if the loan has not been repaid.  The loan is prepayable at any time without penalty.  On December 9, 2005, $73,184,000 of this loan was repaid to the Company.
On January 9, 2006, Toys announced plans and is in the process of closing 87 Toys "R" Us stores in the United States, of which twelve stores will be converted into Babies "R" Us stores, five leased properties are expiring and one has been sold.  Vornado is handling the leasing and disposition of the real estate of the remaining 69 stores. As a result of the store-closing program, Toys will incur restructuring and other charges aggregating approximately $155,000,000 before tax, which includes $45,000,000 for the cost of liquidating inventory.  Of this amount, approximately $99,000,000 will be recorded in Toys' fourth quarter ending January 28, 2006 and $56,000,000 will be recorded in the first quarter of their next fiscal year.  These estimated amounts are preliminary and remain subject to change.  The Company's 32.95% share of the $155,000,000 charge is $51,000,000, of which $36,000,000 will have no income statement effect as a result of purchase price accounting and the remaining portion relating to the cost of liquidating the inventory of approximately $9,000,000 after-tax, will be recorded as an expense in the first quarter of 2006.

In August and September 2004, the Company acquired an economic interest in an additional 7,916,900 Sears common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which the Company purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on Sears common shares.  These call and put options had an initial weighted-average strike price of  $39.82 per share, or an aggregate of $315,250,000, expire in April 2006 and provide for net cash settlement.  Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points and is credited for the dividends received on the shares.  The options provide the Company with the same economic gain or loss as if it had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points.  Because these options are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the options at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in "interest and other investment income" on the Company's consolidated statement of income.
On March 30, 2005, as a result of the merger between Sears and Kmart and pursuant to the terms of the contract, the Company's derivative position representing 7,916,900 Sears common shares became a derivative position representing 2,491,819 common shares of Sears Holdings valued at $323,936,000 based on the then closing share price of $130.00 and $146,663,000 of cash.  As a result, the Company recognized a net gain of $58,443,000 based on the fair value of the derivative position on March 30, 2005.  During the fourth quarter of 2005, 402,660 of the common shares were sold at a weighted average sales price of $123.77 per share.  In accordance with the derivative agreements, the proceeds from these sales will remain in the derivative position until the entire position is settled or until expiration in April 2006.  Based on Sears Holdings' closing share price on December 31, 2005 of $115.53, the remaining shares in the derivative position have a market value of $241,361,000, which together with cash of $196,499,000 aggregates $437,860,000.  In the period from March 31, 2005 through December 31, 2005, the Company recorded an expense of $43,475,000 from the derivative position, which consists of (i) $30,230,000 from the mark-to-market of the remaining shares in the derivative based on Sears Holdings $115.53 closing share price on December 31, 2005, (ii) $2,509,000 for the net loss on the shares sold based on a weighted average sales price of $123.77 and (iii) $10,736,000 resulting primarily from the increase in the strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points.
The Company's aggregate net income recognized on the owned shares and the derivative position from inception to December 31, 2005 was $124,266,000.

In connection with the Company's investment in Sears Holdings Corporation, the Company acquired 7,500,000 common shares of Sears Canada between February and September of 2005 for an aggregate cost of $143,737,000, or $19.16 per share.  On December 16, 2005, Sears Canada paid a special dividend, of which Vornado's share was $120,500,000.  As a result, the Company recognized $22,885,000 of income in the fourth quarter of 2005 (in addition to the unrecognized gain of $53,870,000 discussed below) and paid a $.77 special cash dividend on December 30, 2005 to shareholders of record on December 27, 2005.  The Company accounts for its investment in Sears Canada as a marketable equity security classified as available-for-sale.  Accordingly, the common shares are marked-to-market on a quarterly basis through "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income" on the balance sheet.  At December 31, 2005, based on a closing share price of $15.47, the unrecognized gain in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income is $53,870,000.

Investment in
McDonald's Corporation ("McDonalds") (NYSE: MCD)
In July 2005, the Company acquired an aggregate of 858,000 common shares of McDonalds for $25,346,000, an average price of $29.54 per share. These shares are recorded as marketable equity securities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and are classified as "available for sale."  Appreciation or depreciation in the fair market value of these shares is recorded as an increase or decrease in "accumulated other comprehensive income" in the shareholders' equity section of the Company's consolidated balance sheet and not recognized in income.  At December 31, 2005, based on McDonalds' closing stock price of $33.72 per share, $3,585,000 of appreciation in the value of these shares was included in "accumulated other comprehensive income."
During the three months ended September 30, 2005, the Company acquired an economic interest in an additional 14,565,000 McDonalds common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which the Company purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on McDonalds' common shares.  These call and put options have an initial weighted-average strike price of  $32.66 per share, or an aggregate of $475,692,000, expire on various dates between July 30, 2007 and September 10, 2007 and provide for net cash settlement.  Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points (up to 95 basis points under certain circumstances) and is credited for the dividends received on the shares.  The options provide the Company with the same economic gain or loss as if it had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points.  Because these options are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the options at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in "interest and other investment income" on the Company's consolidated statement of income.  During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded net income of $17,254,000, comprised of (i) $15,239,000 from the mark-to-market of the options on December 31, 2005, based on McDonalds' closing stock price of $33.72 per share, (ii) $9,759,000 of dividend income, partially offset by (iii) $7,744,000 for the increase in strike price resulting from the LIBOR charge.
Based on McDonalds' most recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company's aggregate investment in McDonalds represents 1.2% of its outstanding common shares.
Dispositions:
Temperature Controlled Logistics
Prior to November 18, 2004, the Company owned a 60% interest in Vornado Crescent Portland Partnership ("VCPP") which owned Americold Realty Trust ("Americold").  Americold owned 88 temperature controlled warehouses, all of which were leased to AmeriCold Logistics.  On November 4, 2004, Americold purchased its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, for $47,700,000 in cash.  On November 18, 2004, the Company and its 40% partner, Crescent Real Estate Equities Company ("CEI") collectively sold 20.7% of Americold's common shares to The Yucaipa Companies ("Yucaipa") for $145,000,000, which resulted in a gain, of which the Company's share was $18,789,000. The sale price was based on a $1.450 billion valuation for Americold before debt and other obligations.  Yucaipa is a private equity firm with significant expertise in the food distribution, logistics and retail industries.  Upon closing of the sale to Yucaipa on November 18, 2004, Americold is owned 47.6% by the Company, 31.7% by CEI and 20.7% by Yucaipa.
Pursuant to the sales agreement: (i) Yucaipa may be entitled to received up to 20% of the increase in the value of Americold, realized through the sale of a portion of the Company's and CEI's interests in Americold subject to limitations, provided that Americold's Threshold EBITDA, as defined, exceeds $133,500,000 at December 31, 2007; (ii) the annual asset management fee payable by CEI to the Company has been reduced from approximately $5,500,000 to $4,548,000, payable quarterly through October 30, 2027.  CEI, at its option, may terminate the payment of this fee at any time after November 2009, by paying the Company a termination fee equal to the present value of the remaining payments through October 30, 2027, discounted at 10%.  In addition, CEI is obligated to pay a pro rata portion of the termination fee to the extent it sells a portion of its equity interest in Americold; and (iii) VCPP was dissolved.  The Company has the right to appoint three of the five members to Americold's Board of Trustees.  Consequently, the Company is deemed to exercise control over Americold and, on November 18, 2004, the Company began to consolidate the operations and financial position of Americold into its accounts and no longer accounts for its investment on the equity method.

Prior to the exchange, the Company accounted for its investment in the partnership on the equity method.  Subsequent to the exchange, the Company accounted for its investment in PGE as a marketable equity security-available for sale, as the Company's shares represent less than a 20% ownership interest in PGE (which is not a partnership), the Company did not have significant influence and the common shares had a readily determinable fair value.  On July 1, 2005, a third party acquired all of Prime's outstanding common shares and limited partnership units for $7.25 per share or unit.

10.  Stock-based Compensation
The Company's Share Option Plan (the "Plan") provides for grants of incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights and performance shares to certain employees and officers of the Company.
Restricted stock awards are granted at the market price on the date of grant and vest over a three to five year period.  The Company recognizes the value of restricted stock as compensation expense based on the Company's closing stock price on the NYSE on the date of grant on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  As of December 31, 2005, there are 260,267 restricted shares outstanding (excluding 626,566 shares issued to the Company's President in connection with his employment agreement).  The Company recognized $3,559,000, $4,200,000 and $3,239,000 of compensation expense in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, for the portion of these shares that vested during each year.  Dividends paid on unvested shares are charged directly to retained earnings and amounted to $1,038,000, $938,700 and $777,700 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Dividends on shares that are cancelled or terminated prior to vesting are charged to compensation expense in the period of the cancellation or termination.
Stock options are granted at an exercise price equal to 100% of the market price of the Company's stock on the date of grant, generally vest pro-rata over three to five years and expire 10 years from the date of grant.  As of December 31, 2005 there are 12,671,000 options outstanding.  On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS 123: Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148: Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure, on a prospective basis covering all grants subsequent to 2002.  Under SFAS No. 123, the Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of options granted on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  For the year ended December 31, 2005, and 2004, the Company recognized $1,042,000 and $102,900 of compensation expense related to the options granted during 2005 and 2003.  Grants prior to 2003 are accounted for under the intrinsic value method under which compensation expense is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the Company's stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the option granted.  As the Company's policy is to grant options with an exercise price equal to 100% of the quoted market price on the grant date, no compensation expense has been recognized for options granted prior to 2003.  If compensation cost for grants prior to 2003 were recognized as compensation expense based on the fair value at the grant dates, net income and income per share would have been reduced to the pro-forma amounts below:

11.  Retirement Plans
The Company has two defined benefit pension plans, a Vornado Realty Trust Retirement Plan ("Vornado Plan") and a Merchandise Mart Properties Pension Plan ("Mart Plan").  In addition, Americold Realty Trust, which is consolidated into the accounts of the Company beginning November 18, 2004, has two defined benefit pension plans (the "AmeriCold Plans" and together with the Vornado Plan and the Mart Plan "the Plans").  The benefits under the Vornado Plan and the Mart Plan were frozen in December 1997 and June 1999, respectively.  In April 2005, Americold amended its Americold Retirement Income Plan to freeze benefits for non-union participants.  Benefits under the Plans are or were primarily based on years of service and compensation during employment or on years of credited service and established monthly benefits.  Funding policy for the Plans is based on contributions at the minimum amounts required by law.  The financial results of the Plans are consolidated in the information provided below.
The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for the Plans.
Obligations and Funded Status
The following table sets forth the Plans' funded status and amounts recognized in the Company's balance sheets:

The Company periodically reviews its assumptions for the rate of return on each Plan's assets.  The assumptions are based primarily on the long-term historical performance of the assets of the Plans, future expectations for returns for each asset class as well as target asset allocation of Plan assets.  Differences in the rates of return in the short term are recognized as gains or losses in the periods that they occur.

12.  Leases
As lessor:
The Company leases space to tenants under operating leases. Most of the leases provide for the payment of fixed base rentals payable monthly in advance. Shopping center leases provide for the pass-through to tenants of real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance. Office building leases generally require the tenants to reimburse the Company for operating costs and real estate taxes above their base year costs. Shopping center leases also provide for the payment by the lessee of additional rent based on a percentage of the tenants' sales. As of December 31, 2005, future base rental revenue under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding rents for leases with an original term of less than one year and rents resulting from the exercise of renewal options, is as follows:
 
These amounts do not include rentals based on tenants' sales.  These percentage rents approximated $6,571,000, $5,563,000, and $3,662,000, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
None of the Company's tenants represented more than 10% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Former Bradlees Locations
Pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, dated May 1, 1992, the Company is due $5,000,000 per annum of additional rent from Stop & Shop which was allocated to certain of Bradlees former locations.  On December 31, 2002, prior to the expiration of the leases to which the additional rent was allocated, the Company reallocated this rent to other former Bradlees leases also guaranteed by Stop & Shop.  Stop & Shop is contesting the Company's right to reallocate and claims the Company is no longer entitled to the additional rent.  At December 31, 2005, the Company is due an aggregate of $15,300,000.  The Company believes the additional rent provision of the guaranty expires at the earliest in 2012 and is vigorously contesting Stop & Shop's position.

12.  Leases - continued
As lessee:
The Company is a tenant under operating leases for certain properties. These leases have terms that expire during the next thirty years.  Future minimum lease payments under operating leases at December 31, 2005, are as follows:
 
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively
Rent expense was $22,146,000, $21,334,000, and $15,593,000 for the years ended
.
The Company is also a lessee under capital leases for equipment and real estate (primarily Americold).  Lease terms generally range from 5-20 years with renewal or purchase options.  Capitalized leases are recorded at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the property.  Capitalized leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the asset or life of the related lease, whichever is shorter.  Amortization expense on capital leases is included in "depreciation and amortization" on the Company's consolidated statements of income.  As of December 31, 2005, future minimum lease payments under capital leases are as follows:
 
At December 31, 2005 and 2004, $48,329,000 and $54,261,000 representing the present value of net minimum payments is included in "Other Liabilities" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  At December 31, 2005 and 2004, property leased under capital leases had a total cost of $66,483,000 and $64,974,000 and related accumulated depreciation of $17,066,000 and $11,495,000, respectively.

13.  Commitments and Contingencies
facilities contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.
At December 31, 2005, the Company's $600,000,000 revolving credit facility, which expires in July 2006, had a zero outstanding balance and $22,311,000 was reserved for outstanding letters of credit. This facility contains financial covenants, which require the Company to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization, and provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in the Company's ratings below Baa3/BBB.  At December 31, 2005, Americold's $30,000,000 revolving credit facility had a $9,076,000 outstanding balance and $17,000,000 was reserved for outstanding letters of credit.
  This facility requires Americold to maintain, on a trailing four-quarter basis, a minimum of $30,000,000 of free cash flow, as defined.  Both of these
expenditures to be funded over the next six years at the Springfield Mall, in which it has a 97.5% interest.

n November 10, 2005, the Company committed to fund the junior portion of up to $30,530,000 of a $173,000,000 construction loan to an entity developing a mix-use building complex in Boston, Massachusetts, at the north end of the Boston Harbor.  The Company will earn current-pay interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 11%.  The loan will mature in November 2008, with a one-year extension option.  The Company anticipates funding all or portions of the loan beginning in 2006.
In addition to the above, o
The Company carries comprehensive liability and all risk property insurance ((i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended coverage, (iv) "acts of terrorism" as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 which expires in 2007 and (v) rental loss insurance) with respect to its assets.

13.  Commitments and Contingencies
The Company's debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by its properties (which are generally non-recourse to the Company), its senior unsecured notes due 2007, 2009 and 2010, its exchangeable senior debentures due 2025 and its revolving credit agreements, contain customary covenants requiring the Company to maintain insurance.  Although the Company believes that it has adequate insurance coverage under these agreements, the Company may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future.  Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than the Company is able to obtain, or if the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 is not extended past 2007, it could adversely affect the Company's ability to finance and/or refinance its properties and expand its portfolio.
Each of the Company's properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to the Company.
On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey ("USDC-NJ") claiming the Company has no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty.  On May 17, 2005, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment.  On July 15, 2005, Stop & Shop opposed the Company's motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.  On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denying the motions for summary judgment.  The Company intends to pursue its claims against Stop & Shop vigorously.  There are various other legal actions against the Company in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.
The Company enters into agreements for the purchase and resale of U.S. government obligations for periods of up to one week. The obligations purchased under these agreements are held in safekeeping in the name of the Company by various money center banks. The Company has the right to demand additional collateral or return of these invested funds at any time the collateral value is less than 102% of the invested funds plus any accrued earnings thereon.  The Company had $177,650,000 and $23,110,000 of cash invested in these agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004.
From time to time, the Company has disposed of substantial amounts of real estate to third parties for which, as to certain properties, it remains contingently liable for rent payments or mortgage indebtedness that cannot be quantified by the Company.

14.  Related Party Transactions
Loan and Compensation Agreements
On December 22, 2005, Steven Roth, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, repaid to the Company his $13,122,500 outstanding loan which was scheduled to mature in January 2006.  Pursuant to a credit agreement dated November 1999, Mr. Roth may draw up to $15,000,000 of loans from the Company on a revolving basis.  Each loan bears interest, payable quarterly, at the applicable Federal rate on the date the loan is made and matures on the sixth anniversary of such loan.  Loans are collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the amount outstanding.  On December 23, 2005, Mr. Roth borrowed $13,122,500 under this facility, which bears interest at 4.45% per annum and matures on December 23, 2011.
At December 31, 2005, the balance of the loan due from Michael Fascitelli, the Company's President, in accordance with his employment agreement was $8,600,000.  The loan matures in December 2006 and bears interest, payable quarterly, at a weighted average rate of 3.97% (based on the applicable Federal rate).
Effective January 1, 2002, the Company extended its employment agreement with Mr. Fascitelli for a five-year period through December 31, 2006.  Pursuant to the extended employment agreement, Mr. Fascitelli is entitled to receive a deferred payment on December 31, 2006 of 626,566 Vornado common shares which are valued for compensation purposes at $27,500,000 (the value of the shares on March 8, 2002, the date the extended employment agreement was executed).  The shares are held in a rabbi trust for the benefit of Mr. Fascitelli and vested 100% on December 31, 2002.  The extended employment agreement does not permit diversification, allows settlement of the deferred compensation obligation by delivery of these shares only, and permits the deferred delivery of these shares.  The value of these shares was amortized ratably over the one-year vesting period as compensation expense.  The assets of the rabbi trust are consolidated with those of the Company and the Company's common shares held in the trust are classified in shareholders' equity and accounted for in a manner similar to treasury stock.
Pursuant to the Company's annual compensation review in February 2002 with Joseph Macnow, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, the Compensation Committee approved a $2,000,000 loan to Mr. Macnow, bearing interest at the applicable federal rate of 4.65% per annum and due in June 2007.  The loan was funded on July 23, 2002 and is collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the loan amount.
On February 22, 2005, the Company and Sandeep Mathrani, Executive Vice President  Retail Division, entered into a new employment agreement.  Pursuant to the agreement, the Company granted Mr. Mathrani (i) 16,836 restricted shares of the Company's stock, (ii) stock options to acquire 300,000 of the Company's common shares at an exercise price of $71.275 per share and (iii) the right to receive 200,000 stock options over the next two years at the then prevailing market price.  In addition, Mr. Mathrani repaid the $500,000 loan the Company provided him under his prior employment agreement.
On March 11, 2004, the Company loaned $2,000,000 to Melvyn Blum, an executive officer of the Company, pursuant to the revolving credit facility contained in his January 2000 employment agreement.  Melvyn Blum resigned effective July 15, 2005.  In accordance with the terms of his employment agreement, his $2,000,000 outstanding loan as of June 30, 2005 was repaid on August 14, 2005.

Transactions with Affiliates and Officers and Trustees of the Company
Alexander's
The Company owns 33% of Alexander's.  Mr. Roth and Mr. Fascitelli are officers and directors of Alexander's.  The Company provides various services to Alexander's in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements.  See Note  5 Investments in Partially-Owned Entities for details of these agreements.
On December 29, 2005, Michael Fascitelli, the Company's President and President of Alexander's, exercised 350,000 of his Alexander's stock appreciation rights ("SARs") which were scheduled to expire in December 2006 and received $173.82 for each SAR exercised, representing the difference between Alexander's stock price of $247.70 (the average of the high and low market price) on the date of exercise and the exercise price of $73.88.  This exercise was consistent with Alexander's tax planning.
On January 10, 2006, the Omnibus Stock Plan Committee of the Board of Directors of Alexander's granted Mr. Fascitelli a SAR covering 350,000 shares of Alexander's common stock.  The exercise price of the SAR is $243.83 per share of common stock, which was the average of the high and low trading price of Alexander's common stock on date of grant and will become exercisable on July 10, 2006, provided Mr. Fascitelli is employed with Alexander's on such date, and will expire on March 14, 2007.  Mr. Fascitelli's early exercise and Alexander's related tax consequences were factors in Alexander's decision to make the new grant to him.
Interstate Properties
As of December 31, 2005, Interstate Properties and its partners owned approximately 9.2% of the common shares of beneficial interest of the Company and 27.7% of Alexander's common stock.  Interstate Properties is a general partnership in which Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the partners.  Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the managing general partner of Interstate Properties, and the Chief Executive Officer and a director of Alexander's.  Messrs. Mandelbaum and Wight are trustees of the Company and also directors of Alexander's.
The Company manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate Properties pursuant to a management agreement for which the Company receives an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent.  The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days' notice at the end of the term. Although the management agreement was not negotiated at arm's length, the Company believes based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies that its terms are fair to the Company. The Company earned $791,000, $726,000 and $703,000 of management fees under the management agreement for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003.  In addition, during the fiscal year ended 2003, as a result of a previously existing leasing arrangement with Alexander's, Alexander's paid to Interstate $587,000, for leasing and other services actually rendered by the Company.  Upon receipt of these payments, Interstate promptly paid them over to the Company without retaining any interest therein.  This arrangement was terminated at the end of 2003 and all payments by Alexander's thereafter for these leasing and other services are made directly to the Company.
Vornado Operating Company ("Vornado Operating")
In October 1998, Vornado Operating was spun off from the Company in order to own assets that the Company could not itself own and conduct activities that the Company could not itself conduct.  Vornado Operating's primary asset was its 60% investment in AmeriCold Logistics, which leased 88 refrigerated warehouses from Americold, owned 60% by the Company.  On November 4, 2004, Americold purchased its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, for $47,700,000 in cash.  As part of this transaction, Vornado Operating repaid the $21,989,000 balance of its loan to the Company as well as $4,771,000 of unpaid interest.  Because the Company fully reserved for the interest income on this loan beginning in January 2002, it recognized $4,771,000 of income upon collection in the fourth quarter 2004.
On March 22, 2005, the Court approved the settlement.
In November 2004, a class action shareholder derivative lawsuit was brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Vornado Operating, its directors and the Company.  The lawsuit sought to enjoin the dissolution of Vornado Operating, rescind the previously completed sale of AmeriCold Logistics (owned 60% by Vornado Operating) to Americold (owned 60% by the Company) and damages.  In addition, the plaintiffs claimed that the Vornado Operating directors breached their fiduciary duties.  On November 24, 2004, a stipulation of settlement was entered into under which the Company agreed to settle the lawsuit with a payment of approximately $4,500,000 or about $1 per Vornado Operating share or partnership unit before litigation expenses. The Company accrued the proposed settlement payment and related legal costs as part of "general and administrative expense" in the fourth quarter of 2004.

On January 1, 2003, the Company acquired BMS, a company which provides cleaning and related services principally to the Company's Manhattan office properties, for $13,000,000 in cash from the estate of Bernard Mendik and certain other individuals including David R. Greenbaum, an executive officer of the Company.  The Company paid BMS $53,024,000, for the year ended December 31, 2002 for services rendered to the Company's Manhattan office properties.  Although the terms and conditions of the contracts pursuant to which these services were provided were not negotiated at arms length, the Company believes based upon comparable amounts charged to other real estate companies that the terms and conditions of the contracts were fair to the Company.
On August 4, 2003, the Company completed the acquisition of 2101 L Street, a 370,000 square foot office building located in Washington D.C.  The consideration for the acquisition consisted of approximately 1.1 million newly issued Operating Partnership units (valued at approximately $49,517,000) and the assumption of existing mortgage debt and transaction costs totaling approximately $32,000,000.  Robert H. Smith and Robert P. Kogod, trustees of Vornado, together with family members, owned approximately 24 percent of the limited partnership that sold the building and Mr. Smith was a general partner.

Schear, President of the Company's CESCR division and other former members of Kaempfer management were also partners in the Investment Building partnership.
On December 20, 2005, the Company acquired a 46% partnership interest in, and became co-general partner of, partnerships that own a complex in Rosslyn, Virginia, containing four office buildings with an aggregate of 714,000 square feet and two apartment buildings containing 195 rental units.  The consideration for the acquisition consisted of 734,486 newly issued Vornado Realty L.P. partnership units (valued at $61,814,000) and $27,300,000 of its pro-rata share of existing debt. Of the partnership interest acquired, 19% was from Robert H. Smith and Robert P. Kogod, trustees of Vornado, and their family members, representing all of their interest in the partnership.

19. Segment Information
The Company has five business segments: Office, Retail, Merchandise Mart Properties, Temperature Controlled Logistics and Toys "R" Us.  EBITDA represents "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization."  Management considers EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the un-levered performance of its segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity.  As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, management utilizes this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of its assets to that of its peers.  EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income.  EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.
