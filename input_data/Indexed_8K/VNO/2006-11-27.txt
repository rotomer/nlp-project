The Debentures are an unsecured and unsubordinated obligation of the Company and rank equally with all of the unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company.  The Debentures are unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantor with respect to the punctual payment of the principal, premium and any interest on the Debentures in the event the Company fails to make such payments.  The guarantee is an unsecured and unsubordinated obligation of the Guarantor and ranks equally with all of the unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Guarantor.  The Debentures are convertible into common shares of the Company under the circumstances described in the prospectus supplement filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 17, 2006.
A copy of the Indenture is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Form 8-K and is herein incorporated by reference.

Item 2.03.  Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant (Vornado Realty L.P. only).
On November 20, 2006, the Company transferred the net proceeds from the sale of the Debentures to the Guarantor in return for a debenture (the "Private Debenture") issued by the Guarantor to the Company in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(2) thereof. The aggregate principal amount of the Private Debenture is $1,000,000,000, the Private Debenture bears interest at 3.625% per annum and it has a stated maturity date of November 15, 2026. In certain circumstances the Company will be entitled to a number of Class A Units of limited partnership interest of the Guarantor, or the cash value of such Units, upon tendering the Private Debenture to the Guarantor. The Guarantor may in certain circumstances deliver to the Company its Class A Units of limited partnership interest in satisfaction of its obligation under the Private Debenture.

 Acts of Holders; Record Dates.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Issuer and to the Guarantor. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or
8
instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 601) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Issuer and the Guarantor if made in the manner provided in this Section.
The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.
The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee, the Issuer, or the Guarantor in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.
The Issuer may, in the circumstances permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to give, make or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders of Securities of such series, provided that the Issuer may not set a record date for, and the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to, the giving or making of any notice, declaration, request or direction referred to in the next paragraph. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to take the relevant action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Issuer from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Issuer, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Trustee in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106.
The Trustee may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to join in the giving or making of (i) any Notice of Default, (ii) any declaration of acceleration referred to in Section 502, (iii) any request to institute proceedings referred to in Section 507(2) or (iv) any direction referred to in Section 512, in each
9
case with respect to Securities of such series. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration, request or direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Issuer's expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Issuer in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106.
With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which sets such record dates may designate any day as the "Expiration Date" and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day; provided that no such change shall be effective unless notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is given to the other party hereto in writing, and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which set such record date shall be deemed to have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Expiration Date shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable record date.
Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such principal amount.
SECTION 105.

(20)         if the Securities of the series are to be Guaranteed Securities; and
(21)         any other terms of the series (which terms shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture, except as permitted by Section 901(5)).
All Securities of any one series shall be substantially identical except as to denomination and except as may otherwise be provided in or pursuant to the Board Resolution referred to above and (subject to Section 303) set forth, or determined in the manner provided, in the Officers' Certificate referred to above or in any such indenture supplemental hereto. All Securities of any one series need not be issued at one time and, unless otherwise provided or contemplated by this Section 301 with respect to a series of Securities, additional Securities of a series may be issued at the option of the Issuer, without the consent of any Holder, at any time and from time to time.
If any of the terms of the series are established by action taken pursuant to a Board Resolution or, if applicable, a Guarantor's Board Resolution, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Issuer on behalf of
22
the Issuer or Vornado Realty Trust, on behalf of the Guarantor, as the case may be, and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officers' Certificate or Guarantor's Officers' Certificate setting forth the terms of the series.
SECTION 302.
  Denominations.
The Securities of each series shall be issuable only in registered form without coupons and only in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 301. In the absence of any such specified denomination with respect to the Securities of any series, the Securities of such series shall be issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof.
SECTION 303.
  Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.
The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Issuer by the Chairman of the Board, the Vice Chairman of the Board, the President or one of the Vice Presidents, under the trust seal reproduced thereon attested by the Secretary, one of the Assistant Secretaries or other authorized Person of the Issuer, and if such Securities are Guaranteed Securities, on behalf of the Guarantor by Vornado Realty Trust, as general partner of the Guarantor, by the Chairman of the Board, the Vice Chairman of the Board, the President or one of the Vice Presidents, under the trust seal of Vornado Realty Trust reproduced thereon attested by the Secretary, one of the Assistant Secretaries or other authorized Person of the Issuer. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile.
Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Issuer or Vornado Realty Trust shall bind the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities.
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Issuer may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Issuer and, if applicable, having endorsed thereon the Guarantees executed by the Guarantor, to the Trustee for authentication, together with an Issuer Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Issuer Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities. If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established by or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Sections 201 and 301, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating,
(1)           if the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 201, that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(2)           if the terms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution and, if such Securities are Guaranteed Securities, and the terms thereof have been established by or pursuant to a Guarantor's Board Resolution, as permitted by
23
Section 301, that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(3)           that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Issuer in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Issuer, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles; and
(4)           that such Guarantees, when the Securities upon which they shall have been endorsed shall have been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Issuer in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Guarantor enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, including where the size of an Outstanding series of Securities is increased as contemplated by Section 301, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate or Guarantor's Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 301 or the Issuer Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.
Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
No Security or Guarantee endorsed thereon shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Issuer, and the Issuer shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 309, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
SECTION 304.
  Temporary Securities.
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Issuer and the Guarantor, if such Securities are Guaranteed Securities, may execute, and upon Issuer Order the
24
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued, and, if applicable, having endorsed thereon the Guarantees duly executed by the Guarantor substantially of the tenor of the definitive Guarantees and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities and, if applicable, the Guarantees.
If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Issuer will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Issuer in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Issuer and the Guarantor, if such Securities are Guaranteed Securities, shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, and, if applicable, having endorsed thereon the Guarantees duly executed by the Guarantor substantially of the tenor of the definitive Guarantees. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series and tenor.
SECTION 305.
  Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
The Issuer shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office and in any other office or agency of the Issuer in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Issuer shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of a series at the office or agency of the Issuer in a Place of Payment for that series, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount.
At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Issuer and Guarantor, if such Securities are Guaranteed Securities, shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantor, if such Securities are Guaranteed Securities, respectively, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
25
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Issuer or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 906 or 1107 not involving any transfer.
If the Securities of any series (or of any series and specified tenor) are to be redeemed in part, the Issuer shall not be required (A) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities of that series (or of that series and specified tenor, as the case may be) during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of any such Securities selected for redemption under Section 1103 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (B) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
The provisions of Clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) below shall apply only to Global Securities:
(1)           Each Global Security authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture.
(2)           Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, and subject to such applicable provisions, if any, as may be specified as contemplated by Section 301, no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless (A) such Depositary has notified the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable or no longer permitted under applicable law to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or (B) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to such Global Security or (C) the Issuer so directs the Trustee by Company Order or (D) there shall exist such circumstances, if any, in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as have been specified for this purpose as contemplated by Section 301.
(3)           Subject to Clause (2) above and to such applicable provisions, if any, as may be specified as contemplated by Section 301, any exchange of a Global Security for other Securities may be made in whole or in part, and all Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Security shall direct.
(4)           Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security or any portion thereof, whether pursuant to this Section, Section 304, 306, 906 or 1107 or otherwise, shall be
26
authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Security, unless such Security is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof.
SECTION 306.
  Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Issuer and the Guarantor, if such Securities are Guaranteed Securities, shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and, if applicable, a Guarantee endorsed thereon, and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
If there shall be delivered to the Issuer, if applicable, the Guarantor and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Issuer or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Issuer and the Guarantor, if such Securities are Guaranteed Securities, shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and, if applicable, having a Guarantee endorsed thereon, and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Issuer in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Issuer may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Issuer and the Guarantor, if such Securities are Guaranteed Securities, respectively, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
SECTION 307.
  Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date
27
for such interest or, if no business is conducted by the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office on such date, at 5:00 P.M., New York City time, on such date.
Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Issuer, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:
(1)           The Issuer may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Issuer shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Issuer, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be given to each Holder of Securities of such series in the manner set forth in Section 106, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).
(2)           The Issuer may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Issuer to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
Except as may be provided in this Section 307 or as contemplated in Section 301 with respect to any Securities of a series, the Person to whom interest shall be payable on any Security that first becomes payable on a day that is not an Interest Payment Date shall be the Holder of such Security on the day such interest is paid.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall
28
carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
SECTION 308.
  Persons Deemed Owners.
Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Issuer, the Guarantor, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer, the Guarantor or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 307) any interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Issuer, the Guarantor, the Trustee nor any agent of the Issuer, the Guarantor or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
SECTION 309.
  Cancellation.
All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Issuer or the Guarantor may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Issuer or the Guarantor may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Issuer or the Guarantor has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of as directed by an Issuer Order; , that the Trustee shall not be required to destroy such cancelled Securities.
provided, however
SECTION 310.
  Computation of Interest.
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
SECTION 311.
  CUSIP Numbers.
The Issuer in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders, provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities. Any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers.
29
SECTION 401.
  Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.
This Indenture shall upon Issuer Request cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of any Security expressly provided for herein or in the terms of such Security), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Issuer, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when
(1)           either
(A)          all Securities theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (i) Securities which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 306 and (ii) Securities for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Issuer or the Guarantor and thereafter repaid to the Issuer or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 1003) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
(B)           all such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation
(i)            have become due and payable, or
(ii)           will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or
(iii)          are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer,
and the Issuer or the Guarantor, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose money in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal and any premium and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be;
(2)           the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Issuer; and
(3)           the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with.
Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantor, if applicable, to the Trustee under Section 607, the obligations of the
30
Trustee to any Authenticating Agent under Section 614 and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of Clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 402 and the last paragraph of Section 1003 shall survive.
SECTION 402.
  Application of Trust Money.
Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 401 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Issuer or the Guarantor acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal and any premium and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee.
SECTION 501.
  Events of Default.
"Event of Default", wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any series, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):
(1)           default in the payment of any interest upon any Security of that series when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; or
(2)           default in the payment of the principal of or any premium, if any, on any Security of that series at its Maturity; or
(3)           default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of a Security of that series; or
(4)           default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or warranty of the Issuer or the Guarantor (if any Guaranteed Securities are Outstanding) in this Indenture (other than a covenant or warranty a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with or which has expressly been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of series of Securities other than that series), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Issuer and the Guarantor by the Trustee or to the Issuer, the Guarantor, and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or
(5)           a default under any bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer (including a default with respect to
31
Securities of any series other than that series) having an aggregate principal amount outstanding of at least $50,000,000, or under any mortgage, indenture or instrument (including this Indenture) under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer having an aggregate principal amount outstanding of at least $50,000,000, whether such indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter be created, which default (A) shall constitute a failure to pay any portion of the principal of such indebtedness when due and payable after the expiration of any applicable grace period with respect thereto or (B) shall have resulted in such indebtedness becoming or being declared due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise have become due and payable, without, in the case of Clause (A), such indebtedness having been discharged or without, in the case of Clause (B), such indebtedness having been discharged or such acceleration having been rescinded or annulled, in each such case within a period of 10 days after there shall have been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Issuer by the Trustee or to the Issuer and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice specifying such default and requiring the Issuer to cause such indebtedness to be discharged or cause such acceleration to be rescinded or annulled, as the case may be, and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; , , that, subject to the provisions of Sections 601 and 602, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of such default unless either (A) a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have knowledge of such default or (B) the Trustee shall have received written notice thereof from the Issuer, from any Holder, from the holder of any such indebtedness or from the trustee under any such mortgage, indenture or other instrument; or
provided
however
(6)           the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (A) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Issuer or the Guarantor (if any Guaranteed Securities are Outstanding) in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (B) a decree or order adjudging the Issuer or the Guarantor (if any Guaranteed Securities are Outstanding) a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Issuer or the Guarantor (if any Guaranteed Securities are Outstanding) under any applicable Federal or State law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Issuer or the Guarantor (if any Guaranteed Securities are Outstanding) or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; or
(7)           the commencement by the Issuer or the Guarantor (if any Guaranteed Securities are Outstanding) of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Issuer or the Guarantor (if any Guaranteed Securities are Outstanding) in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable Federal or State law, or the consent by it to the filing of such petition or to

(8)           any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series.
SECTION 502.
  Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 501(6) or 501(7)) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee, upon receipt of a request from the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, shall, or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may, declare the principal amount of all the Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified by the terms thereof) to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Issuer and the Guarantor (if any Guaranteed Securities are Outstanding) (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(6) or 501(7) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs, the principal amount of all the Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified by the terms thereof) shall automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, become immediately due and payable.
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if
(1)           the Issuer or the Guarantor has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay
(A)          all overdue interest on all Securities of that series,
(B)           the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities,
(C)           to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and

If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 611 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation or removal, the Trustee resigning or being removed may petition, at the expense of the Issuer, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.

43
those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Issuer, the Guarantor or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates.
Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Issuer and the Guarantor shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the first or second preceding paragraph, as the case may be.

Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent.

If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Issuer. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Issuer. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Issuer and shall give notice of such appointment in the manner provided in Section 106 to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
The Issuer agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time such compensation for its services under this Section as the Issuer and the Authenticating Agent shall from time to time agree in writing.
If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternative certificate of authentication in the following form:

(7)           Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other agreement or instrument to which the Issuer is a party or by which it is bound.
(8)           Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in the trust arising from such deposit constituting an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act unless such trust shall be registered under such Act or exempt from registration thereunder.

if certificated Securities have been issued, the certificate numbers of the withdrawn Securities, or if not certificated, the notice must comply with appropriate procedures of The Depository Trust Company or any successor depositary for the Securities; and
                                         
the principal amount, if any, which remains subject to the Repurchase Notice.
                                         
Holders must either effect book-entry transfer of the Securities or deliver the Securities, together with necessary endorsements, to the office of the Paying Agent after delivery of the Repurchase Notice to receive payment of the Repurchase Price.  Holders will receive payment on the Repurchase Date or, in the case of a global security,

the time of book-entry transfer, or the delivery of the Securities.  If the Paying Agent holds money or securities sufficient to pay the Repurchase Price of the Securities to which the Repurchase Notice relates on the Business Day following the Repurchase Date, then:
such Securities will cease to be Outstanding;
                                         
interest will cease to accrue on such Securities; and
                                         
all rights as a Holder with respect to such Securities will terminate.
                                         
Repurchase at Option of Holders Upon a Change in Control
If there shall have occurred a Change in Control at any time prior to November 15, 2011, Holders of Securities shall have the right to require the Company to repurchase Securities not previously called for redemption, or any portion of the principal amount thereof, that is equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000, at a cash purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of all Securities such Holders require the Company to repurchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest on those Securities to, but excluding, the Repurchase Date (such amount, the ""), subject to satisfaction by or on behalf of the Holder of the requirements set forth in this Security and in the Indenture.
Change in Control Purchase Price
Within 15 days after the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Company shall mail a written notice of Change in Control by first-class mail to the Trustee and to each Holder (and to beneficial owners as required by applicable law and procedures of The Depository Trust Company or any successor depositary) as provided in the Indenture.
A Holder may exercise its rights specified in this paragraph upon delivery of a written notice of purchase in the form set forth below (a "") to the Paying Agent at any time prior to the close of business not more than 20 Business Days following the date of notice by the Company to Holders of the Change in Control, stating:
Change in Control Purchase Notice
the certificate number of the Securities which the Holder will deliver to be purchased;
(1)
                                 
the principal amount of the Security which the Holder will deliver to be purchased, which must be $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof; and
(2)
                                 
that such Security shall be purchased pursuant to the terms and conditions specified herein and in the Indenture.
(3)
                                 
The delivery of Securities to the Paying Agent prior to, on or after the Change in Control Purchase Date (together with all necessary endorsements) at the offices of the Paying Agent shall be a condition to the receipt by the Holder of the
7
Change in Control Purchase Price therefor; , , that such Change in Control Purchase Price shall be so paid only if the Securities so delivered to the Paying Agent shall conform in all respects to the description thereof set forth in the related Change in Control Purchase Notice.
provided
however
The Company shall purchase from the Holder thereof a portion of a Security if the principal amount of such portion is $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000.
The Paying Agent shall promptly notify the Company of the receipt by it of any Change in Control Purchase Notice.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Securities may be purchased by the Company at the option of a Holder upon a Change in Control if the principal amount of the Securities has been accelerated and such acceleration has not been rescinded on or prior to such date.
If a Change in Control occurs on or after November 15, 2011, no holder will have the right to require the Company to purchase any Securities except as provided in the Indenture and under "Repurchase Rights" above on the reverse of this Security.
Upon receipt by the Paying Agent of the Repurchase Notice or Change in Control Purchase Notice, a Holder of Securities in respect of which such Repurchase Notice or Change in Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be, was given shall (unless such Repurchase Notice is withdrawn as specified below) thereafter be entitled to receive solely the Repurchase Price or Change in Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, with respect to such Security.  Such Repurchase Price or Change in Control Purchase Price shall be paid to such Holder, subject to receipt of funds and/or Securities by the Paying Agent or Conversion Agent, promptly following the later of (x) the Repurchase Date or the Change in Control Purchase Date, as the case may be, with respect to such Securities (provided the conditions set forth herein and in the Indenture for such payment are satisfied) and (y) the time of delivery of such Securities to the Paying Agent by the Holder thereof in the manner required herein.  Securities in respect of which a Repurchase Notice or Change in Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be, has been given by the Holder thereof may not be converted on or after the date of the delivery of such Repurchase Notice or Change in Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be, unless, solely in the case of a Repurchase Notice, it has first been validly withdrawn as specified below.
A Repurchase Notice may be withdrawn by means of a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the office of the Paying Agent prior to the close of business on the second Business Day prior to the Repurchase Date specifying:
the certificate number of the Security in respect of which such notice of withdrawal is being submitted;
(1)
                                 
the principal amount of the Security with respect to which such notice of withdrawal is being submitted; and
(2)
                                 
8
the principal amount of such Security which remains subject to the original Purchase Notice or and which has been or will be delivered for purchase by the Company.
(3)
                                 
Make Whole Amount
If a transaction described in clause (1) or clause (2) of the definition of Change in Control occurs on or prior to November 15, 2011, and a Holder elects to convert its Securities in connection with such transaction, the Company will increase the applicable Conversion Rate for the Securities surrendered in order to provide for conversion into a number of Additional Shares of the Company as described below.  A conversion of Securities shall be deemed for these purposes to be "in connection with" such a Change in Control if the notice of conversion of the Securities is received by the Conversion Agent on or after the 15th Business Day prior to the anticipated effective date of the Change in Control and on or prior to the fifth Business Day following the effective date of the Change in Control (or, if earlier and to the extent applicable, the close of business on the second Trading Day immediately preceding the day on which the Company is required to repurchase Securities upon a Change in Control.
The number of Additional Shares will be determined by reference to the table below and is based on the date on which such Change in Control transaction becomes effective (the "") and the price (the "") paid per Common Share in such transaction.  If the holders of Common Shares receive only cash in the Change in Control transaction, the stock price shall be the cash amount paid per share.  Otherwise the stock price shall be the average of the closing sale prices of Common Shares on the 10 Trading Days up to but excluding the effective date.
effective date
stock price
The stock prices set forth in the first row of the table (i.e., the column headers) will be adjusted as of any date on which the Conversion Rate of the Securities is adjusted.  The adjusted stock prices will equal the stock prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the stock price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted.  The right to receive the Additional Shares will be subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate.
The following table sets forth the stock price and number of Additional Shares to be received per $1,000 principal amount of Securities:
 
9
The exact stock prices and effective dates may not be set forth in the table, in which case:
if the stock price is between two stock price amounts in the table or the effective date is between two dates in the table, the additional shares will be determined by straight-line interpolation between the number of Additional Shares set forth for the higher and lower stock price amounts and the two dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
(1)
                                 
if the stock price is equal to or in excess of $325.00 per share (subject to adjustment), no Additional Shares will be issued upon conversion; and
(2)
                                 
if the stock price is less than $118.04 per share (the closing sale price of Common Shares on November 15, 2006) (subject to adjustment), no Additional Shares will be issued upon exchange.
(3)
                                 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the total number of Common Shares issuable upon conversion exceed 8.4717 per $1,000 principal amount of Securities, subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate.
Conversion Settlement
A Holder of Securities may, subject to the restrictions on ownership of Common Shares set forth in the Company's Declaration of Trust and the conditions described herein and in the Indenture, convert Securities for cash, Common Shares, if any, or a combination thereof, at the Company's election, based on the Conversion Rate in effect at the time of conversion (6.5168 Common Shares per $1,000 principal amount of Securities on November 20, 2006).
Upon conversion of the Securities, the Company will deliver, in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of Securities tendered for conversion:
cash in an amount (the "principal return") equal to the lesser of (a) the principal amount of Securities surrendered for conversion and (b) the conversion value, and
                                         
if the conversion value is greater than the principal return, an amount (the "net amount") in cash or Common Shares, as determined by the Company, with an aggregate value equal to the difference between the conversion value and the principal return.
                                         
The Company may elect to deliver any portion of the net amount in cash (the "net cash amount") or Common Shares, and any portion of the net amount the Company delivers in Common Shares (the "net shares") will be the sum of the daily share amounts (calculated as described below) for each Trading Day during the
10
applicable conversion period. Prior to the close of business on the second Trading Day following the date on which Securities are tendered for conversion, the Company will, by notice to the Trustee, inform Holders of such Securities of its election to pay cash for all or a portion of the net amount and, if applicable, the portion of the net amount that will be paid in cash and the portion that will be delivered in the form of net shares, unless the Company has previously informed such Holder of such election in a Notice of Redemption for Securities.
The Company will deliver cash in lieu of any fractional Common Shares issuable in connection with payment of the net shares based upon the average price.
The "conversion value" for each $1,000 principal amount of Securities is equal to (a) the applicable Conversion Rate, multiplied by (b) the average price.
The "applicable conversion period" means the 10 consecutive Trading-Day period commencing on the third Trading Day following the date the Securities are tendered for conversion.
The "average price" is equal to the average of the closing sale prices of Common Shares for each Trading Day in the applicable conversion period.
The "daily share amount" for each $1,000 principal amount of Securities and each Trading Day in the applicable conversion period is equal to the greater of:
zero; and
a number of Common Shares determined by the following formula:
 
The conversion value, principal return, net amount, net cash amount and the number of net shares, as applicable, shall be determined by the Company promptly after the end of the applicable conversion period. The Company will pay the principal return and cash in lieu of fractional shares, and deliver net shares or pay the net cash amount, as applicable, no later than the third Business Day following the last Trading Day of the applicable conversion period.
Conversion Rights
No fractional Common Shares will be delivered upon conversion of the Securities.  Instead, the Company will pay the cash value of such fractional shares in connection with such settlement based upon the closing sale price of Common Shares on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Conversion Date.
11
If a Security has been called for redemption, Holders will be entitled to convert such Security from the date of notice of the redemption until the close of business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Redemption Date.  The right to convert will expire at that time, unless the Company defaults in making the payment due upon redemption.  A Holder may convert fewer than all of such Holder's Securities so long as the Securities converted are an integral multiple of $1,000 principal amount.
Upon surrender of a Security for conversion into Common Shares, such Holder shall deliver to the Company cash equal to the amount that the Company is required to deduct and withhold under applicable law in connection with the conversion; , , if the Holder does not deliver such cash, the Company may deduct and withhold from the amount of cash otherwise deliverable to such Holder the amount required to be deducted and withheld under applicable law (and not otherwise delivered by the Holder in cash).
provided
however
Holders may surrender their Securities for conversion for cash, Common Shares, if any, or a combination of cash and Common Shares, at the option of the Company, at the applicable Conversion Rate prior to the second Business Day immediately prior to Stated Maturity at any time on or after November 15, 2025 and also under any of the following circumstances:
  A Holder may surrender any of its Securities during any Measurement Period if the closing sale prices of Common Shares on the principal national securities exchange on which the Common Shares are listed, for a period of at least 20 Trading Days beginning on the first day of such Measurement Period is more than 125% of the Conversion Price per share of Common Shares on the first day of such Measurement Period.  If an event requiring adjustment of the Conversion Rate shall have occurred during the period of 30 consecutive Trading Days beginning on the first day of such Measurement Period, the closing sale price of Common Shares on each Trading Day of such period elapsing prior to the occurrence of the event shall be deemed for purposes of the calculation described in the previous sentence to have been appropriately adjusted to reflect the occurrence of the event. A Holder may surrender any of its Securities for conversion into Common Shares at any time after November 15, 2025.  In such event, the holder may convert any of its Securities into Common Shares at any time thereafter prior to the close of business on the second Business Day immediately prior to the Stated Maturity of the Securities. The Conversion Agent shall, on behalf of the Company,

Conversion Upon Satisfaction of Market Price Condition.
12
 
determine daily if the Securities are convertible as a result of the closing sale price of Common Shares and notify the Company and the Trustee.
  A Holder may surrender any of its Securities for conversion during the five consecutive Trading Day period following any 20 consecutive Trading Days in which the average of the trading prices (as determined following a request by a holder of the Securities) for a Security during such 20 consecutive Trading-Day period was less than 98% of the average closing sale price of Common Shares for such period, multiplied by the applicable Conversion Rate for such period.  Common Shares will be valued at 100% of the average closing sale prices for the 20 consecutive Trading Days preceding the Conversion Date.
(2)
                                 
Conversion Upon Satisfaction of Trading Price Condition.
  A Holder may surrender for conversion any of the Securities called for redemption at any time prior to the close of business two Business Days prior to the Redemption Date, even if the Securities are not otherwise convertible at such time.  However, if a Holder has already delivered a Repurchase Notice or a Change in Control Purchase notice with respect to a Security, the Holder may not surrender that Security for conversion until, in the case of a Repurchase Notice, the Holder has withdrawn the notice in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

Conversion Upon Specified Transactions.
distribute to all holders of Common Shares rights entitling them to purchase, for a period expiring within 60 days, Common Shares at less than the closing sale price of Common Shares on the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration of the distribution; or
(A)
                             
distribute to all holders of Common Shares the Company's assets, debt securities or rights to purchase the Company's securities, which distribution has a per share value exceeding 15.0% of the closing sale price of Common Shares on the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration date for such distribution,
(B)
                               
13
 
the Company shall notify the Holders of the Securities in writing at least 20 days prior to the ex-dividend date for such distribution.  Following the issuance of such notice, Holders may surrender their Securities for conversion at any time until the earlier of the close of business on the Business Day prior to the ex-dividend date or the Company's announcement that such distribution will not take place; ,, that a Holder may not exercise this right to convert if the Holder may participate, on an as-converted basis, in the distribution without conversion of the Securities.  The ex-dividend date for purposes of the foregoing is the first date upon which a sale of the Common Shares does not automatically transfer the right to receive the relevant distribution from the seller of Common Shares to its buyer.
provided
however
  A Holder of Securities may surrender any of its Securities for conversion into Common Shares at the applicable Conversion Rate if the Common Shares are not listed on a U.S. national securities exchange for 30 consecutive Trading Days.

Conversion Upon Delisting of Common Shares.
The Securities may also be converted in accordance with the other provisions of the Indenture setting forth the circumstances in which the Securities may be converted.
Conversion Procedures
A Holder will not receive any cash payment representing accrued interest upon conversion of a Security.  Instead, upon conversion the Company will deliver to tendering Holders cash, a fixed number of Common Shares, if any, and any cash payment to account for fractional shares.  The cash payment for fractional shares in connection with a conversion settled in Common Shares will be based on the closing sale price of Common Shares on the trading day immediately prior to the Conversion Date.  Delivery of cash and Common Shares, if any, will be deemed to satisfy the Company's obligation to pay the principal amount of the Securities, including any accrued and unpaid interest.  Accrued and unpaid interest will be deemed paid in full rather than canceled, extinguished or forfeited.  In no event will the Company adjust the Conversion Rate to account for the accrued interest.
Upon conversion of a Security, the Company will pay any documentary stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of Common Shares, if any, unless the tax is due because the Holder requests the shares to be issued or delivered to a person other than the registered Holder, in which case the Holder must pay the tax prior to the delivery of the Common Shares.  Certificates representing Common Shares will not be
14
 
issued or delivered unless all taxes and duties, if any, payable by the Holder have been paid.
Securities tendered for conversion after a Record Date for an interest payment but prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date will receive on the Interest Payment Date interest accrued on those Securities, notwithstanding the conversion of Securities prior to the Interest Payment Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Holder that surrenders for conversion a Security during such period must pay to the Company an amount equal to the interest that has accrued and that will be paid on the Securities being converted on the Interest Payment Date, unless such Securities are surrendered for conversion after being called for redemption after a Record Date for an Interest Payment Date or that are surrendered for conversion after the last Record Date for the payment of interest on the Securities.  If in such an event prior to the Redemption Date a Holder elects to exchange Securities, such Holder will not be required to pay at the time of surrender of Securities for conversion the amount of interest on the Securities that it will receive on the date that has been fixed for redemption.
Except as set forth in the Indenture, no other payment or adjustment for interest, or for any dividends in respect of Common Shares, will be made upon conversion of Securities.  Holders of Common Shares issued upon exchange will not be entitled to receive any dividends payable to holders of Common Shares as of any record time or date before the close of business on the Conversion Date.
In order to exercise its conversion right, a Holder must deliver an irrevocable conversion notice, in the form attached hereto together with the certificated Security, to the Conversion Agent who will, on behalf of the Holder, convert the Securities into Common Shares, cash or a combination of cash and Common Shares.
The initial Conversion Rate is 6.5168 Common Shares for each $1,000 principal amount of Securities and shall be subject to adjustment at the times and in the manner provided in the Indenture.  The initial Conversion Price is $153.45 per Common Share and shall be subject to adjustment at the times and in the manner provided in the Indenture.
 of a share, as the case may be.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Securities are called for redemption, all adjustments not previously made will be made on the applicable Redemption Date.  Except as specifically described in the Indenture, the applicable Conversion Price will not be subject to adjustment in the case of the issuance of any Common Shares or preferred shares of the Company, or securities convertible into or convertible for Common Shares or preferred shares of the Company.
No adjustment in the applicable Conversion Price will be required unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of the applicable Conversion Price.  If the adjustment is not made because the adjustment does not change the applicable Conversion Price by more than 1%, then the adjustment that is not made will be carried forward and taken into account in any future adjustment.  All required calculations will be made to the nearest cent or 1/1000

Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture
The Company may not discharge a Holder's rights to exchange Securities in accordance with the terms of these Securities and the Indenture or to have registered the transfer or exchange of Securities in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or Trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Debentures in respect of which a Repurchase Notice or Change in Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be, has been given by the Holder thereof may not be exchanged on or after the date of the delivery of such Repurchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be, unless, solely in the case of a Repurchase Notice, it has first been validly withdrawn as specified below.
A Repurchase Notice may be withdrawn by means of a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the office of the Paying Agent prior to the close of business on the second Business Day prior to the Repurchase Date specifying:

A conversion of Debentures shall be deemed for these purposes to be "in connection with" such a Change in Control if the notice of conversion of the Debentures is received by the Conversion Agent on or after the 15th Business Day prior to the anticipated effective date of the Change in Control and on or prior to the fifth Business Day following the effective date of the Change in Control (or, if earlier and to the extent applicable, the close of business on the second Trading Day immediately preceding the day on which the Company is required to repurchase Debentures upon a Change in Control as described in paragraph (l) above).
Additional Shares
The number of Additional Shares will be determined by reference to the table below and is based on the date on which such Change in Control transaction becomes effective (the "") and the price (the "") paid per Common Share in such transaction.  If the holders of Common Shares receive only cash in the Change in Control transaction, the stock price shall be the cash amount paid per Common Share.  Otherwise, the stock price shall be the average of the closing sale prices of Common Shares on the 10 Trading Days up to but excluding the effective date.
effective date
stock price
The stock prices set forth in the first row of the table (i.e., the column headers) will be adjusted as of any date on which the Conversion Rate of the Debentures is adjusted.  The adjusted stock prices will equal the stock prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the stock price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted.  The right to receive the Additional Shares will be subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate.
The following table sets forth the stock price and number of Additional Shares to be received per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures:

The exact stock prices and effective dates may not be set forth on the table, in which case:
if the stock price is between two stock price amounts on the table or the effective date is between two dates on the table, the additional shares will be determined by straight-line interpolation between the number of Additional Shares set forth for the higher and lower stock price amounts and the two dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
(1)
                                 
if the stock price is equal to or in excess of $325.00 per share (subject to adjustment), no Additional Shares will be issued upon conversion; and

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the total number of Common Shares issuable upon conversion exceed 8.4717 per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures, subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate.
  A Holder of Debentures may, subject to the restrictions on ownership of Common Shares set forth in the Company's Declaration of Trust and the conditions described in paragraphs (o) and (q) below, for cash, Common Shares, if any, or a combination of cash and Common Shares, at the Company's option, at the Conversion Rate in effect at the time of conversion (6.5168 Common Shares per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures on November 20, 2006).  Subject to such restrictions, the Company will deliver, in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of Debentures tendered for conversion:

The Company may elect to deliver any portion of the Net Amount in cash or Common Shares, and any portion of the net amount the Company elects to deliver in Common Shares (the "") will be the sum of the daily share amounts (calculated as described below) for each Trading Day during the applicable conversion period.  Prior to the close of business on the second Trading Day following the date on which Debentures are tendered for conversion, the Company will, by notice to the trustee, inform holders of such Debentures of the Company's election to pay cash for all or a portion of the Net Amount and, if applicable, the portion of the Net Amount that will be paid in cash and the portion that will be delivered in the form of Net Shares, unless the Company has previously informed such holders of such election in a notice of redemption for Debentures.

The Company will pay the principal return and cash in lieu of fraction shares, and deliver net shares or pay the net cash amount, as applicable, no later than the third business day following the last Trading Day of the applicable conversion period.
.  In connection with a conversion with respect to which the Company settles entirely in Common Shares, no fractional Common Shares will be delivered upon conversion of the Debentures.  Instead, the Company will pay the cash value of such fractional shares in connection with such settlement based upon the closing sale price of Common Shares on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Conversion Date.

If a Debenture has been called for redemption, Holders will be entitled to convert such Debenture from the date of notice of the redemption until the close of business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Redemption Date.  The right to convert will expire at that time, unless the Company defaults in making the payment due upon redemption.  A Holder may convert fewer than all of such Holder's Debentures so long as the Debentures converted are an integral multiple of $1,000 principal amount.

Following the issuance of such notice, Holders may surrender their Debentures for conversion at any time until the earlier of the close of business on the Business Day prior to the ex-dividend date or the Company's announcement that such distribution will not take place; ,, that a Holder may not exercise this right to convert if the Holder may participate, on an as-converted basis, in the distribution without conversion of the Debentures.  The ex-dividend date for purposes of the foregoing is the first date upon which a sale of the Common Shares does not automatically transfer the right to receive the relevant distribution from the seller of Common Shares to its buyer.

In addition, if the Company is party to any transaction described in clause (1) of the definition of "Change in Control" or any other consolidation, merger or binding share exchange pursuant to which Common Shares would be converted into cash, securities or other property, a Holder may surrender Debentures for conversion at any time from and after the date that is 15 Business Days prior to the anticipated effective date of the transaction until five Business Days after the actual date of such transaction.
If the Company is party to any transaction described in clause (1) of the definition of "Change in Control" or any other consolidation, merger or binding share exchange pursuant to which Common Shares are converted into cash, securities or other property, then at the effective time of the transaction, the right to convert a Debenture into Common Shares will be changed into a right to convert the Debentures into the kind and amount of cash, securities or other property that the Holder would have received if the Holder had converted its Debentures immediately prior to the effective time of the transaction (assuming such Holder did not exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash or other property receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance).  If a Holder converts Debentures in accordance with this paragraph and the Holder is entitled to an adjustment for additional Common Shares as described in paragraph (m) herein, the conversion of the Debentures will settle after the effective time of such transaction.  In addition, if Holders convert their Debentures at any time following the effective time of the transaction, the amount paid will be paid based on the kind and amount of such cash, securities or other property.
If such transaction also constitutes a Change in Control, the holder will be able to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of such

Holder's Debentures as described in paragraph (l).  In addition, if such transaction constitutes a Change in Control as described in clause (l) and (2) of the definition thereof, the Company will adjust the Conversion Rate for Debentures tendered for conversion in connection with the transaction, as described in paragraph (m) hereof.
  A Holder of Debentures may surrender any of its Debentures for conversion into Common Shares at the applicable Conversion Rate if the Common Shares are not listed on a U.S. national securities exchange for a 30 consecutive Trading Day period.

The closing sale price will be determined without regard to after-hours trading or extended market making.  In the absence of such quotations, the Company will determine the closing sale price on such basis as it considers appropriate.
Closing sale price

  A Holder will not receive any cash payment representing accrued interest upon conversion of a Debenture.  Instead, upon conversion the Company will deliver to tendering Holders, cash, a fixed number of Common Shares, if any, and any cash payment to account for fractional shares.  The cash payment for fractional shares in connection with a conversion settled in Common Shares will be based on the closing sale price of Common Shares on the Trading Day immediately prior to the Conversion Date.  Delivery of cash and Common Shares, if any, will be deemed to satisfy the Company's obligation to pay the principal amount of the Debentures, including any accrued and unpaid interest.  Accrued and unpaid interest will be deemed paid in full rather than canceled, extinguished or forfeited.  In no event will the Company adjust the Conversion Rate to account for the accrued interest.
(q)
                                
Conversion Procedures.
Upon conversion of a Debenture, the Company will pay any documentary stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of Common Shares, if any, unless the tax is due because the Holder requests the shares to be issued or delivered to a person other than the registered Holder, in which case the Holder must pay the tax prior to the delivery of the Common Shares.  Certificates representing Common Shares will not be issued or delivered unless all taxes and duties, if any, payable by the Holder have been paid.
Debentures tendered for conversion after a Record Date for an interest payment but prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, will receive on the Interest Payment Date interest accrued on those Debentures, notwithstanding the conversion of Debentures prior to the Interest Payment Date, assuming the Holder was the holder of record on the corresponding Record Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Holder that surrenders for conversion a Debenture during such period, must pay to the Company an amount equal to the interest that has accrued and that will be paid on the Debentures being converted on the Interest Payment Date, unless such Debentures are surrendered for conversion after being called for redemption after a Record Date for an Interest Payment Date or such Debentures are converted after the Record Date for the payment of interest on the Debentures immediately preceding the Stated Maturity of the Debentures.  If in such an event prior to the Redemption Date a Holder elects to convert Debentures, such Holder will not be required to pay at the time of surrender of Debentures for conversion the amount of interest on the Debentures that it will receive on the date that has been fixed for redemption.
22
Except as set forth herein, no other payment or adjustment for interest, or for any dividends in respect of Common Shares, will be made upon conversion of Debentures.  Holders of Common Shares issued upon conversion will not be entitled to receive any dividends payable to holders of Common Shares as of any record time or date before the close of business on the conversion date.
In order to exercise its conversion right, a Holder must deliver an irrevocable conversion notice, together, if the Debentures are in certificated form, with the certificated security, to the Conversion Agent who will, on behalf of the Holder, convert the Debentures for Common Shares, cash or a combination of cash and Common Shares.
In case any Debenture shall be surrendered for partial exchange, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or upon the written order of the holder of the Debenture so surrendered, without charge to such Holder, a new Debenture or Debentures in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Debentures.
The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time as follows:
(r)
                                   
Conversion Rate Adjustments. 
If the Company issues Common Shares as a dividend or distribution on Common Shares to all holders of Common Shares, or if the Company effects a share split or share combination, the conversion rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
(1)
                                 
CR1 = CR0 x OS1/OS0
where
CR0 = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such event
CR1 = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after such event
OS0 = the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to such event
OS1 = the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after such event.
Any adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph (1) shall become effective on the date that is immediately after the earlier of (x) the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive
23
such dividend or other distribution or (y) the date on which such split or combination becomes effective, as applicable.  If any dividend or distribution described in this paragraph is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
If the Company issues to all holders of Common Shares any rights, warrants, options or other securities entitling them for a period of not more than 45 days after the date of issuance thereof to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares, or securities convertible into shares of Common Shares within 45 days after the issuance thereof, in either case at an exercise price per share or a conversion price per share less than the closing sale price of Common Shares on the Business Day immediately preceding the time of announcement of such issuance, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula (provided that the Conversion Rate will be readjusted to the extent that such rights, warrants, options, or other securities or convertible securities are not exercised or converted prior to the expiration of the exercisability or convertibility thereof):
(2)
                                 
CR1 = CR0 x (OS0+X)/(OS0+Y)
where
CR0 = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such event
CR1 = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after such event
OS0 = the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to such event
X = the total number of Common Shares issuable pursuant to such rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities
Y = the number of Common Shares equal to the quotient of (A) the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities and (B) the average of the closing sale prices of Common Shares for the 10 consecutive trading days prior to the Business Day immediately preceding the date of announcement for the issuance of such rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities.

For purposes of this paragraph (2), in determining whether any rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities entitle the holder to subscribe for or purchase or exercise a conversion right for Common Shares at less than the average closing sale price of Common Shares, and in determining the aggregate exercise or conversion price payable for such Common Shares, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Company's Board of Trustees.
If the Company distributes shares of capital stock, evidences of indebtedness or other assets or property of the Company to all holders of Common Shares, excluding:
(3)
                                 
dividends, distributions and rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities referred to in paragraph (1) or (2) above,
(A)
                             
dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash, and
(B)
                               
spin-offs described below in this paragraph (3)
(C)
                               
then the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
CR1 = CR0 x SP0/(SP0-FMV)
where
CR0 = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such distribution
CR1 = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after such distribution
SP0 = the average of the closing sale prices of Common Shares for the 10 consecutive trading days prior to the Business Day immediately preceding the earlier of the record date or the ex-dividend date for such distribution
FMV = the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Company's Board of Trustees) of the shares of capital stock,
25
evidences of indebtedness, assets or property distributed with respect to each outstanding Company Common Share on the earlier of the Record Date or the ex-dividend date for such distribution.
An adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph (3) shall be made successively whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective on the day immediately after the date fixed for the determination of holders of Common Shares entitled to receive such distribution.
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (3) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on Common Shares or shares of capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit of the Company (such transaction, a ""), the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the close of business on the Record Date fixed for determination of holders of Common Shares entitled to receive the distribution will be increased based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
CR1 = CR0 x (FMV0+MP0)/MP0
where
CR0 = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such distribution
CR1 = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after such distribution
FMV0 = the average of the closing sale prices of the capital stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of Common Shares applicable to one Company Common Share over the first 10 consecutive trading days after the effective date of the Spin-Off
MP0 = the average of the closing sale prices of Common Shares over the first 10 consecutive Trading Days after the effective date of the Spin-Off.
The adjustment to the Conversion Rate under the preceding paragraph with respect to a Spin-Off will occur on the 10th Trading Day from, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off.
26
If any such dividend or distribution described in this paragraph is declared but not paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
If following the date of original issuance of the Debentures the Company makes any cash dividend or distribution during any of its quarterly fiscal periods to all holders of Common Shares in an aggregate amount that, together with other cash dividends or distributions made during such quarterly fiscal period, exceeds the product of $0.85 (the ""), multiplied by the number of Common Shares outstanding on the record date for such distribution, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
(4)
                                 
Reference Dividend
CR1 = CR0 x SP0 /(SP0-C)
where
CR0 = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the record date for such distribution
CR1 = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the record date for such distribution
SP0 = the average of the closing sale prices of Common Shares for the 10 consecutive Trading Days prior to the business day immediately preceding the earlier of the record date or the day prior to ex-dividend date for such distribution
C = the amount in cash per share that the Company distributes to holders of Common Shares during such quarterly fiscal period that exceeds the Reference Dividend.
An adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph shall become effective on the date immediately after the Record Date for the determination of holders of Common Shares entitled to receive such dividend or distribution.  If any dividend or distribution described in this paragraph is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
The Reference Dividend shall be subject to adjustment on account of any of the events set forth in paragraph (1) above of this
27
paragraph (r).  Any such adjustment will be effected by multiplying the Reference Dividend by a fraction, the numerator of which will equal OS0 and the denominator of which will equal OS1, in each case, within the meaning of paragraph (1) above.
If the Company or any of its subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for Common Shares to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per Company Common Share exceeds the closing sale price of a Company Common Share on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the ""), the Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:
(5)
                                 
Expiration Time
CR1 = CR0 x (AC + (SP1 x OS1))/(SP1 x OS0)
where
CR0 = the Conversion Rate in effect on the date such tender or exchange offer expires
CR1 = the Conversion Rate in effect on the day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires
AC = the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration (as determined by the Company's Board of Trustees) paid or payable for shares purchased in such tender or exchange offer
OS0 = the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the date such tender or exchange offer expires
OS1 = the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after such tender or exchange offer expires (after giving effect to the purchase or exchange of shares pursuant to such tender or exchange offer)
SP1 = the average of the closing sale prices of Common Shares for the 10 consecutive Trading Days commencing on the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires.
If the application of the foregoing formula would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be made.
28
Any adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph (5) shall become effective on the date immediately following the Expiration Time.  If the Company or one of its subsidiaries is obligated to purchase Common Shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Company or such subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an adjustment pursuant to paragraph (4) or (5) above, in no event will the conversion rate exceed 8.4717, subject to adjustment pursuant to paragraphs (1), (2) and (3).
(6)
                                 
If the Company adopts a rights plan while any Debentures remain outstanding, Holders of Debentures will receive, upon conversion of their Debentures for Common Shares, in addition to Common Shares, rights under the Company's shareholder rights agreement unless, prior to conversion, the rights have expired, terminated or been redeemed or unless the rights have separated from the Common Shares.  If the rights provided for in the rights plan adopted by the Company have separated from the Common Shares in accordance with the provisions of the applicable shareholder rights agreement so that Holders of Debentures would not be entitled to receive any rights in respect of Common Shares issuable upon conversion of Debentures, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company had distributed, to all holders of Common Shares, shares of capital stock, evidences of indebtedness or other assets or property pursuant to paragraph (3) above, subject to readjustment upon the subsequent expiration, termination or redemption of the rights.  In lieu of any such adjustment, the Company may amend such applicable shareholder rights agreement to provide that upon conversion of Debentures the Holders will receive, in addition to Common Shares issuable upon such conversion, the rights which would have attached to such Common Shares if the rights had not become separated from the Common Shares under such applicable shareholder rights agreement.  To the extent that the Company adopts any future shareholder rights agreement, upon conversion of Debentures into Common Shares, a Holder of Debentures shall receive, in addition to Common Shares, the rights under the future shareholder rights agreement whether or not the rights have separated from Common Shares at the time of conversion and no
(7)
                                 
29
adjustment will be made in accordance with paragraph (3) or otherwise.
In addition to the adjustments pursuant to paragraphs (1) through (7) above, the Company may increase the Conversion Rate in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of the Company capital stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of capital stock (or rights to acquire Common Shares) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes.  The Company may also, from time to time, to the extent permitted by applicable law, increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period if the Company has determined that such increase would be in the best interests of the Company.  If the Company makes such determination, it will be conclusive.  If the Company makes such a determination it will mail to Holders of record of the Debentures a notice of the increase at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect in accordance with applicable law and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
The Company will not make any adjustment the Conversion Rate if Holders are permitted to participate, on an as-converted basis, in the transactions described above.
The applicable Conversion Price will not be adjusted upon certain events, including but not limited to:
the issuance of any Common Shares pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on securities of the Company and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Shares under any plan;
(A)
                             
the issuance of any Common Shares or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, trustee or consultant benefit plan, employee agreement or arrangement or program of the Company;
(B)
                               
the issuance of any Common Shares pursuant to any option, warrant, right, or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the date the Debentures were first issued;
(C)
                               
a change in the par value of Common Shares;
(D)
                              
accumulated and unpaid dividends or distributions;
(E)
                                
30
as a result of a tender offer solely to holders of less than 100 Common Shares; and
(F)
                                
for the avoidance doubt, the issuance of limited partnership units by the Operating Partnership and the issuance of Common Shares or cash upon redemption thereof.
(G)
                               
 of a share, as the case may be.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Debentures are called for redemption, all adjustments not previously made will be made on the applicable Redemption Date.  Except as specifically described above, the applicable Conversion Price will not be subject to adjustment in the case of the issuance of any Common Shares or Company preferred shares, or securities exchangeable for or convertible into Common Shares or Company preferred shares.
No adjustment in the applicable Conversion Price will be required unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of the applicable Conversion Price.  If the adjustment is not made because the adjustment does not change the applicable Conversion Price by more than 1%, then the adjustment that is not made will be carried forward and taken into account in any future adjustment.  All required calculations will be made to the nearest cent or 1/1000
th
Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment.  Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to the Holders of the Debentures within 20 Business Days of the effective date of such adjustment.  Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Debentures or the instructions contained herein, no Holder of Debentures shall be entitled to convert such Debentures for Common Shares to the extent that receipt of such shares would cause such Holder (together with such Holder's affiliates) to exceed the ownership limit contained in the Company's Declaration of Trust as in effect from time to time.
