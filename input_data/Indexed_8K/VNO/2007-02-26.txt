Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
Toys "R" Us, Inc. ("Toys") maintains its financial statements on the Historical Cost ("Recap") basis; Vornado Realty Trust ("Vornado") accounts for its investment in Toys on the Purchase Accounting basis.
Based on information supplied by Toys, Vornado issued a press release on December 13, 2006 announcing its 32.9% share of Toys' third quarter results, which Vornado would be reporting in its fourth quarter. In the December press release, Vornado included in income $36,000,000 of tax benefits primarily relating to the recoverability of deferred tax items applicable to certain of Toys' foreign operations.
On February 23, 2007, it was determined that paragraph 30 and Appendix B, paragraph 268, of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 109 require that under Purchase Accounting Vornado record the $36,000,000 of tax benefits as a reduction of Goodwill. Toys' previously reported financial results for its third quarter are unchanged because under the Historical Cost ("Recap") basis of accounting, these income tax benefits are appropriately recorded as a component of net income.
On February 24, 2007 Vornado announced that based on the $36,000,000 adjustment discussed above and other revised information supplied by Toys, fourth quarter results to be reported in Vornado's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, which will be filed February 27, 2007, will include a Toys' net loss of $51,697,000 or $0.30 per diluted share and negative Funds From Operations ("FFO") of $39,827,000 or $0.23, per diluted share. This compares to a Toys' net loss of $8,486,000 and $211,000 of FFO previously disclosed in the December 13, 2006 press release. A reconciliation of Toys' net loss to FFO is a part of the February 24, 2007 press release. A copy of the February 24, 2007 press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
None of the adjustments discussed above affect any previously published financial statements of either Vornado or Toys and they are all non-cash.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information included or incorporated in this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall such information and exhibits be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFEBRUARY 24, 2007
 
Vornado Announces an Increase in its Share of Toys "R" Us' Third Quarter Loss
from a non-cash tax adjustment
Toys "R" Us ("Toys") maintains its financial statements on the Historical Cost ("Recap") basis; Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE: VNO) accounts for its investment in Toys on the Purchase Accounting basis.
Based on information supplied by Toys, Vornado issued a press release on December 13, 2006 announcing its 32.9% share of Toys' third quarter results, which Vornado would be reporting in its fourth quarter. In the December press release, Vornado included in income $36,000,000 of tax benefits primarily relating to the recoverability of deferred tax items applicable to certain of Toys' foreign operations. Toys' management deemed these deferred tax items recoverable because Toys' operations in certain foreign countries which were previously unprofitable, have become profitable.
On February 23, 2007, it was determined that paragraph 30 and Appendix B, paragraph 268, of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 109 require that under Purchase Accounting Vornado record the $36,000,000 of tax benefits as a reduction of Goodwill. Toys' previously reported financial results for its third quarter are unchanged because under the Historical Cost ("Recap") basis of accounting, these income tax benefits are appropriately recorded as a component of net income.
Based on the $36,000,000 adjustment discussed above and other revised information supplied by Toys, fourth quarter results to be reported in Vornado's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, which will be filed February 27, 2007, will include a Toys net loss of $51,697,000 or $0.30 per diluted share and negative Funds From Operations ("FFO") of $39,827,000 or $0.23, per diluted share. This compares to a Toys net loss of $8,486,000 and $211,000 of FFO previously disclosed in the December 13, 2006 press release. See the accompanying reconciliation of net loss to FFO.
None of the adjustments discussed above affect any previously published financial statements of either Vornado or Toys and they are all non-cash.
Certain statements contained herein may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among others, risks associated with the timing of and costs associated with property improvements, financing commitments and general competitive factors.
