Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
 
On May 24, 2007, Vornado Realty L.P. completed its previously announced acquisition of a 70% controlling interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas, a 2.0 million square foot Manhattan office building, located on the entire blockfront between 51st and 52nd Streets on Avenue of the Americas, and the 555 California Street office complex containing 1.8 million square feet, known as the Bank of America Center, located at California and Montgomery Streets in San Francisco's financial district. The purchase price for Vornado's 70% interest in the real estate was approximately $1.807 billion, consisting of $1.010 billion of cash and $797 million of existing debt. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is approximately $775 per square foot for 1290 Avenue of the Americas and approximately $575 per square foot for 555 California Street, based on current measurement of the buildings. The purchase was effected through the acquisition by Vornado Sub of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies (collectively, the "Acquired Companies") that own, indirectly through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership interest and limited partnership interests comprising 69% of the partnerships that own the two properties. The remaining 30% limited partnership interest is owned by Donald J. Trump.
A copy of the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 5, 2007, pursuant to which Vornado Sub acquired the shares of the Acquired Companies is included as Exhibit 99.2 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
