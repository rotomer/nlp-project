On June 28, 2007, Vornado Realty L.P. (tbe "Operating Partnership"), the operating partnership through which Vornado Realty Trust conducts its business, completed the first of three closings relating to its agreement to acquire a 15 shopping center portfolio aggregating approximately 1.9 million square feet.

The units were issued in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(2) thereof. Upon the satisfaction of certain conditions related primarily to the future performance of the Properties, the sellers of the Properties may be entitled to additional consideration after the closing of the acquisition in the form of an as yet undetermined number of Class A Units and Series G-1 Preferred Units.

With respect to any Distribution Period following, and during the continuance of, a failure on the part of the Partnership to redeem any Series G-2 Preferred Unit called for redemption pursuant to Section 2D hereof or noticed or tendered for redemption pursuant to Section 2E hereof, the Annual Distribution Rate with respect to all Series G-2 Preferred Units shall be an amount equal to the rate per annum of $1.750 per Series G-2 Preferred Unit. Such distributions with respect to each Series G-2 Preferred Unit shall be cumulative from the date of issuance of such Series G-2 Preferred Unit and shall be payable quarterly, when, as and if authorized and declared by the General Partner, in arrears on Distribution Payment Dates, commencing on the first Distribution Payment Date after June 28, 2007. Distributions are cumulative from the most recent Distribution Payment Date to which distributions have been paid; provided that the amount per Series G-2 Preferred Unit to be paid in respect of the initial Distribution Period, or any other period shorter or longer than a full Distribution Period, shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (ii) below. Accumulated and unpaid distributions for any past Distribution Periods may be declared and paid at any time, without reference to any regular Distribution Payment Date.
(ii)
  
The amount of distributions per Series G-2 Preferred Unit accruing in each full Distribution Period shall be computed by dividing the Annual Distribution Rate by four. The amount of distributions payable for the initial Distribution Period, or any other period shorter or longer than a full Distribution Period, on the Series G-2 Preferred Units shall be computed on the basis of twelve 30-day months and 360-day year. The holders of the then outstanding Series G-2 Preferred Units shall not be entitled to any distributions, whether payable in cash, property or securities, in excess of cumulative distributions, as herein provided, on the Series G-2 Preferred Units. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any distribution payment or payments on the Series G-2 Preferred Units that may be in arrears.
(iii)
 
So long as any Series G-2 Preferred Units are outstanding, no distributions, except as described in the immediately following sentence, shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any series or class or classes of Parity Units (as defined below) for any period unless full cumulative distributions have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payment on the Series G-2 Preferred Units for all Distribution Periods terminating on or prior to the distribution payment date on such class or series of Parity Units, except in the case of distributions on the Series B-2 Restricted Preferred Units to the extent not paid due to a lack of funds in the Nongovernmental Account. When distributions are not paid in full or a sum sufficient for such payment is not set apart, as aforesaid, all distributions declared upon Series G-2 Preferred Units and all distributions declared upon any other series or class or classes of Parity Units shall be declared ratably in proportion to the respective amounts of distributions accumulated and
 
6
 
unpaid on the Series G-2 Preferred Units and such Parity Units, except in the case of distributions on the Series B-2 Restricted Preferred Units to the extent not paid due to a lack of funds in the Nongovernmental Account.
(iv)
 
So long as any Series G-2 Preferred Units are outstanding, no distributions (other than distributions paid solely in Junior Units or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase Junior Units) shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment or other distribution declared or made upon Junior Units, nor shall any Junior Units be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired (other than a redemption, purchase or other acquisition of Junior Units made in respect of a redemption, purchase or other acquisition of Common Shares made for purposes of and in compliance with requirements of an employee incentive or benefit plan of the General Partner or any subsidiary), for any consideration (or any moneys to be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such Junior Units) by the General Partner, directly or indirectly (except by conversion into or exchange for Junior Units), unless in each case (a) the full cumulative distributions on all outstanding Series G-2 Preferred Units and any other Parity Units of the Partnership shall have been paid or set apart for payment for all past Distribution Periods with respect to the Series G-2 Preferred Units and all past distribution periods with respect to such Parity Units, except to the extent that distributions on the Series B-2 Restricted Preferred Units are not then able to be paid owing to a lack of funds in the Nongovernmental Account, and (b) sufficient funds shall have been paid or set apart for the payment of the distribution for the current Distribution Period with respect to the Series G-2 Preferred Units and any Parity Units, except to the extent that distributions on the Series B-2 Restricted Preferred Units are not then able to be paid owing to a lack of funds in the Nongovernmental Account.
C.
           
Liquidation Preference
. (i) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partnership or the General Partner, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any payment or distribution of the assets of the Partnership shall be made to or set apart for the holders of Junior Units, holders of the Series G-2 Preferred Units shall be entitled to receive the Series G-2 Preferred Unit Redemption Value per Series G-2 Preferred Unit plus an amount equal to all distributions (whether or not earned or declared) accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution to such holders, but the holders of Series G-2 Preferred Units shall not be entitled to any further payment. If, upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partnership or the General Partner, the assets of the Partnership, or proceeds thereof, distributable to the holders of Series G-2 Preferred Units shall be insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid and liquidating payments on any other Parity Units, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of the Series G-2 Preferred Units and the holders of any such other Parity Units ratably in accordance with the respective amounts that would be payable on such Series G-2 Preferred Units and any such other Parity Units if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. For the purposes of this Section 2.C and 2.G, (i) a consolidation or merger of the Partnership or the General Partner with one or more entities, (ii) a statutory share exchange by the Partnership or the General Partner and (iii) a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Partnership's or
 
7
 
the General Partner's assets, shall not be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, of the Partnership or General Partner.
(ii)
  
Subject to the rights of the holders of Partnership Units of any series or class or classes of shares ranking on a parity with or prior to the Series G-2 Preferred Units upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the General Partner or the Partnership, after payment shall have been made in full to the holders of the Series G-2 Preferred Units, as provided in this Section, any series or class or classes of Junior Units shall, subject to any respective terms and provisions applying thereto, be entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holder of the Series G-2 Preferred Units shall not be entitled to share therein.
D.
          
The Partnership's Right to Redeem the Series G-2 Preferred Units
. (i) Except as set forth in Section 2.E below and the last sentence of this Section 2.D(i), the Series G-2 Preferred Units shall not be redeemable prior to the Permitted Redemption Date. On and after the Permitted Redemption Date, the General Partner may, at its option, cause the Partnership to redeem the Series G-2 Preferred Units in whole or in part, as set forth herein, subject to the provisions described below, at the applicable Redemption Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may, at its option, prior to the Permitted Redemption Date, cause the Partnership to redeem, subject to the provisions described below and at the applicable Redemption Price, any Series G-2 Preferred Units, in whole or in part, held by a holder (w) whose basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes in such Series G-2 Preferred Units is stepped-up under Section 1014 of the Code, (x) who is a qualified charitable institution or an Institutional Lender who has obtained such Series G-2 Preferred Units as a result of a default by the holder of such Series G-2 Preferred Units on a loan from the Institutional Lender, (y) to the extent the proceeds of such redemption will be used to satisfy (or reimburse itself for amounts paid with respect to) such holder's indemnification obligations pursuant to Article 6 of the Contribution Agreement or (z) who is a transferee from such holder described in clauses (w), (x) and (y) above.
(ii)
  
The Redemption Price in respect of each Series G-2 Preferred Unit shall be payable, at the election of the holder thereof, in (x) cash, (y) Class A Units (with each such Class A Unit valued at the applicable Redemption Reference Price), provided that in no event shall the Partnership be required to deliver fractional Class A Units or (z) the form of a Qualified Debt-Financed Distribution (or a combination of (x), (y) and (z)). The Partnership shall provide the holder of each Series G-2 Preferred Unit intended to be redeemed pursuant to this Section D not less than 61 calendar days notice of the date of such redemption. If the holder of any such Series G-2 Preferred Unit fails to elect the form in which the Redemption Price is to be paid on or prior to the 15th calendar day preceding such date of redemption in the manner prescribed in the notice of redemption given by the Partnership, such holder shall be deemed to have elected to receive the Redemption Price in cash. A Partner shall not be entitled to elect to receive Class A Units in payment of the Redemption Price if (but only as long as) the delivery of Class A Units to such Partner on the date of redemption would be prohibited under applicable federal or
 
8
 
state securities laws or regulations. If fewer than all of the outstanding Series G-2 Preferred Units that are not held by the General Partner are to be redeemed, the Series G-2 Preferred Units to be redeemed from each holder (other than the General Partner) shall be selected pro rata (as nearly as practicable without creating fractional units). Any notice of redemption delivered pursuant to this Section 2.D(ii) will be (x) faxed and (y) mailed by certified mail, postage prepaid, not less than 61 calendar days prior to the date upon which such redemption is to occur (the "
Redemption Date
"), addressed to each holder of record of the Series G-2 Preferred Units at their respective addresses as they appear on the records of the Partnership. No immaterial defect in such notice shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any Series G-2 Preferred Units. In addition to any information required by law, each such notice shall state: (a) the Redemption Date, (b) the aggregate number of Series G-2 Preferred Units to be redeemed and, if fewer than all of the outstanding Series G-2 Preferred Units are to be redeemed, the number of Series G-2 Preferred Units to be redeemed held by such holder, which number shall equal such holder's pro rata share (based on the percentage of the aggregate number of outstanding Series G-2 Preferred Units that the total number of Series G-2 Preferred Units held by such holder represents and determined as nearly as practicable without creating fractional interests) of the aggregate number of Series G-2 Preferred Units to be redeemed, (c) the place or places where such Series G-2 Preferred Units are to be surrendered for payment of the amount payable upon redemption and (d)  that payment of such amount will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Series G-2 Preferred Units. If the Partnership gives a notice of redemption in respect of Series G-2 Preferred Units pursuant to this Section 2.D(ii), then, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Redemption Date, the Partnership will deposit irrevocably in trust for the benefit of the holders of Series G-2 Preferred Units being redeemed funds and/or Class A Units sufficient to pay the applicable amount payable with respect to such Series G-2 Preferred Units and will give irrevocable instructions and authority to pay such amount to the holders of the Series G-2 Preferred Units upon surrender of the Series G-2 Preferred Units by such holders at the place designated in the notice of redemption.
(iii)
 
Upon any redemption of Series G-2 Preferred Units, the Partnership shall pay any accumulated and unpaid distributions for any Distribution Period, or any other period shorter than a full Distribution Period, ending on or prior to the Redemption Date. On and after the Redemption Date, distributions will cease to accumulate on the Series G-2 Preferred Units called for redemption, unless the Partnership defaults in payment therefor. If any date fixed for redemption of Series G-2 Preferred Units is not a Unit Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Unit Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Unit Business Day falls in the next calendar year, such payment will be made on the immediately preceding Unit Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date fixed for redemption. If payment of the Redemption Price is improperly withheld or refused and not paid by the Partnership, distributions on such Series G-2 Preferred Units will continue to accumulate at the Annual Distribution Rate from the original redemption date to the date of payment, in which case the actual payment date will be considered the date
 
9
 
fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the applicable Redemption Price. Except as provided above, the Partnership shall make no payment or allowance for unpaid distributions, whether or not in arrears, on Series G-2 Preferred Units called for redemption under this Section 2.D.
(iv)
 
If full cumulative distributions on the Series G-2 Preferred Units and any other series or class or classes of Parity Units have not been paid or declared and set apart for payment, then except in fulfillment of an exercise of the redemption right set forth in Section 2.E below or, in the case of Parity Units, the exercise of any similar redemption, conversion or other similar option granted concurrently with the issuance of such Parity Units, and except to the extent that such distributions or amounts distributable on the Series B-2 Restricted Preferred Units may not be payable due to a lack of funds in the Nongovernmental Account, the Series G-2 Preferred Units may not be redeemed in part and the Partnership may not purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire Series G-2 Preferred Units or any Parity Units other than in exchange for Junior Units.
(v)
  
Except as provided in Section 2.E below, as promptly as practicable after the surrender of any such Series G-2 Preferred Units so redeemed, such Series G-2 Preferred Units shall be exchanged for the amount of cash (without interest thereon), Qualified Debt Financed Distribution or Class A Units payable therefor pursuant to Section 2.D(i). If fewer than all the Series G-2 Preferred Units represented by any physical certificate are redeemed, then the Partnership shall issue new certificates representing the unredeemed Series G-2 Preferred Units without cost to the holder thereof.
(vi)
 
With respect to each redemption of Series G-2 Preferred Units caused by the General Partner pursuant to this Section 2.D (except for redemptions described in the last sentence of Section 2.D(i)), the Partnership shall either (i) cause the Redemption Date to occur on a date on which Qualified Debt Financed Distributions are available pursuant to Section 2.7(e) of the Contribution Agreement or (ii) agree to make Qualified Debt Financed Distributions available on such Redemption Date notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.7(e) of the Contribution Agreement.

General
. (a) Subject to paragraphs (ii) and (iii) below, on or after the third anniversary of the Series G-2 Effective Date (or on the Series G-2 Effective Date with respect to any Series G-2 Preferred Units held by a holder (v) whose basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes in such Series G-2 Preferred Units is stepped-up under Section 1014 of the Code, (w) who is a qualified charitable institution or an "Institutional Lender" who has obtained such Series G-2 Preferred Units as a result of a default by the holder of such Series G-2 Preferred Units on a loan from the Institutional Lender, (x) to the extent the proceeds of such redemption will be used to satisfy (or reimburse itself for amounts paid with respect to) such holder's indemnification obligations pursuant to Article 6 of the Contribution Agreement), (y) who is a transferee from any holder
 
10
 
described in clauses (v), (w) and (x) above, or (z) to the extent such holder (or any of its Unit Distributees, as defined in the Contribution Agreement) elects to have the Redemption Price paid in the form of a Qualified Debt-Financed Distribution), with respect to each Series G-2 Preferred Unit, the holder of such Series G-2 Preferred Unit shall have the right (the "
Series G-2 Redemption Right
") to require the Partnership to redeem such Series G-2 Preferred Unit on any Series G-2 Specified Redemption Date at the applicable Redemption Price. Any such Series G-2 Redemption Right shall be exercised pursuant to notice of redemption comparable to the Notice of Redemption required under Section 8.6 of the Agreement (a "
Series G-2 Notice of Redemption
") delivered to the Partnership (with a copy to the General Partner) by the Limited Partner who is exercising the Series G-2 Redemption Right (the "
Series G-2 Redeeming Partner
"). A holder of the Series G-2 Preferred Units may not exercise the Series G-2 Redemption Right in respect of less than 4,000 Series G-2 Preferred Units held by such holder or, if such holder holds less than 4,000 Series G-2 Preferred Units, all of the Series G-2 Preferred Units held by such holder on the date of the applicable Series G-2 Redemption Notice. Other than causing the Partnership to comply with its obligations hereunder, the General Partner shall not have any obligation to the Redeeming Partner or to the Partnership with respect to the Redeeming Partner's exercise of the Series G-2 Redemption Right. In addition, any redemption pursuant to the Series G-2 Redemption Right shall be subject to all of the provisions of the Agreement governing redemptions under Section 8.6 of the Agreement as if it were a redemption under that section, except as otherwise provided herein. The Redemption Price in respect of each Series G-2 Preferred Unit shall be payable, at the election of the holder thereof, in (x) cash or (y) the form of a Qualified Debt-Financed Distribution. If the holder of any such Series G-2 Preferred Unit fails to elect the form in which the Redemption Price is to be paid concurrently with the delivery of the Series G-2 Notice of Redemption, such holder shall be deemed to have elected to receive the Redemption Price in cash.
(b)
        
The Series G-2 Redeeming Partner shall have no right with respect to any Series G-2 Preferred Units so redeemed to receive any distributions paid after the Series G-2 Specified Redemption Date, unless the record date for the distribution preceded the Series G-2 Specified Redemption Date. If the record date for such distribution was a date prior to the Series G-2 Specified Redemption Date and the Distribution Payment Date in respect of such distribution was a date after the Series G-2 Specified Redemption Date, such Series G-2 Redeeming Partner shall be required, as a condition of the redemption of such Series G-2 Preferred Units, to pay the amount of such distribution to the Partnership.
(c)
         
The Assignee of any Limited Partner may exercise the rights of such Limited Partner pursuant to this Section 2.E, and such Limited Partner shall be deemed to have assigned such rights to such Assignee and shall be bound by the exercise of such rights by such Limited Partner's Assignee. In connection with any exercise of such rights by such Assignee on behalf of such Limited Partner, the Redemption Price and any accumulated and unpaid distributions shall be paid by the Partnership directly to such Assignee and not to such Limited Partner.
 
11
 
(d)
         
The Partnership shall give each holder of record of a Series G-2 Preferred Unit notice of any Change in Control within fifteen (15) days after the occurrence thereof. By notice to the Partnership delivered on or before the 20 Business Day after the date of the notice delivered pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, each holder of record of a Series G-2 Preferred Unit may elect to exercise such holder's rights under this Section 2.E with respect to all Series G-2 Preferred Units held by such holder notwithstanding that the Series G-2 Effective Date shall not have occurred.
th
(iii)
 
No Liens on Partnership Units Delivered for Redemption
. Each holder of any Series G-2 Preferred Units covenants and agrees with the General Partner that all Series G-2 Preferred Units delivered for redemption shall be delivered to the Partnership or the General Partner, as the case may be, free and clear of all liens, and, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, neither the General Partner nor the Partnership shall be under any obligation to acquire Series G-2 Preferred Units which are or may be subject to any liens. Each holder of Series G-2 Preferred Units further agrees that, in the event any state or local property transfer tax is payable as a result of the transfer of its Series G-2 Preferred Units to the Partnership or the General Partner, such holder shall assume and pay such transfer tax.
(iv)
 
In addition to and without limiting any other rights or causes of action which a holder may have hereunder or at law or in equity, each holder shall be entitled to bring an action for specific performance in the event the Partnership defaults in its obligations under Section 2.D or this Section 2.E to redeem any Series G-2 Preferred Unit or to pay the associated Redemption Price in the amount and form required.
F.
           
Conversion
. The Series G-2 Preferred Units are not convertible into or redeemable or exchangeable for any other property or securities of the General Partner or the Partnership at the option of any holder of Series G-2 Preferred Units, except as provided in Sections 2.D and 2.E hereof.
G.

junior to the Series G-2 Preferred Units, as to the payment of distributions or as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the General Partner or the Partnership, if such class or series of Partnership Units shall be Common Partnership Units or if the holders of Series G-2 Preferred Units shall be entitled to receipt of distributions or of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of Partnership Units of such class or series ("

Schedule 1
 
16
 
Schedule 2
 
The Issue Reference Price with respect to any particular Redemption Valuation Date shall be adjusted as follows if any of the events described below occur on or before such Redemption Valuation Date:
(i) If the General Partner issues Common Shares as a dividend or distribution on Common Shares to all holders of Common Shares, or if the General Partner effects a share split or share combination, the Issue Reference Price will be adjusted based on the following formula:
IRP1 = IRP0 x OS0/OS1
where
IRP0 = the Issue Reference Price in effect immediately prior to such event
IRP1 = the Issue Reference Price in effect immediately after such event
OS0 = the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to such event
OS1 = the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after such event.
Any adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph (i) shall become effective on the date that is immediately after the earlier of (x) the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution or (y) the date on which such split or combination becomes effective, as applicable. If any dividend or distribution described in this paragraph (i) is declared but not so paid or made, the Issue Reference Price shall be prospectively adjusted to the Issue Reference Price that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
(ii) If the General Partner issues to all holders of Common Shares any rights, warrants, options or other securities entitling them for a period of not more than 45 days after the date of issuance thereof to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares, or securities convertible into Common Shares within 45 days after the issuance thereof, in either case at an exercise price per share or a conversion price per share less than the closing sale price of Common Shares on the business day immediately preceding the time of announcement of such issuance, the Issue Reference Price will be adjusted based on the following formula (provided that the Issue Reference Price shall be prospectively adjusted to the Issue Reference Price that would be in effect to the extent that such rights, warrants, options, or other securities or convertible securities are not exercised or converted prior to the expiration of the exercisability or convertibility thereof):
IRP1 = IRP0 x (OS0+Y)/(OS0+X)
 
 
where
IRP0 = the Issue Reference Price in effect immediately prior to such event
IRP1 = the Issue Reference Price in effect immediately after such event
OS0 = the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to such event
X = the total number of Common Shares issuable pursuant to such rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities
Y = the number of Common Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities by (B) the average of the closing sale prices of Common Shares for the 10 consecutive trading days prior to the business day immediately preceding the date of announcement (or, if later, the ex-dividend date relating to such announcement) for the issuance of such rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities.
For purposes of paragraph (ii), in determining whether any rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities entitle the holder to subscribe for or purchase or exercise a conversion right for Common Shares at less than the average closing sale price of Common Shares, and in determining the aggregate exercise or conversion price payable for such Common Shares, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the General Partner for such rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the General Partner's board of trustees.
(iii) If the General Partner distributes shares of capital stock, evidences of indebtedness or other assets or property of the General Partner to all holders of Common Shares, excluding:
(A) dividends, distributions and rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities referred to in paragraph (i) or (ii) above,
(B) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash, and
(C) spin-offs described below in this paragraph (iii),
then the Issue Reference Price will be adjusted based on the following formula:
IRP1 = IRP0 x (SP0-FMV)/SPO
 
18
 
where
IRP0 = the Issue Reference Price in effect immediately prior to such distribution
IRP1 = the Issue Reference Price in effect immediately after such distribution
SP0 = the average of the closing sale prices of Common Shares for the 10 consecutive trading days prior to the business day immediately preceding the earlier of the record date or the ex-dividend date for such distribution
FMV = the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the General Partner's board of trustees) of the shares of capital stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets or property distributed with respect to each outstanding Common Share on the earlier of the record date or the ex-dividend date for such distribution.
An adjustment made pursuant to the above paragraph shall be made successively whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective on the day immediately after the date fixed for the determination of holders of Common Shares entitled to receive such distribution.
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to paragraph (iii) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on Common Shares or shares of capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit of the General Partner or the Partnership (such transaction, a "Spin-Off"), the Issue Reference Price in effect immediately before the close of business on the record date fixed for determination of holders of Common Shares entitled to receive the distribution will be adjusted based on the following formula:
IRP1 = IRP0 x MPO/(FMV0+MP0)
where
IRP0 = the Issue Reference Price in effect immediately prior to such distribution
IRP1 = the Issue Reference Price in effect immediately after such distribution
FMV0 = the average of the closing sale prices of the capital stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of Common Shares applicable to one Common Share over the first 10 consecutive trading days after the effective date of the Spin-Off or, if there is no regular market from which closing sale prices may be obtained, the fair market value (as determined
 
19
 
in good faith by the General Partner's board of trustees) of the capital stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of Common Shares applicable to one Common Share
MP0 = the average of the closing sale prices of Common Shares over the first 10 consecutive trading days after the effective date of the Spin-Off.
The adjustment to the Issue Reference Price under the preceding paragraph with respect to a Spin-Off will occur on the 10 trading day from, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off.
th
If any such dividend or distribution described in paragraph (iii) is declared but not paid or made, the Issue Reference Price shall be prospectively adjusted to be the Issue Reference Price that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
(iv) If the General Partner or any of its subsidiaries make a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for Common Shares to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per Common Share exceeds the closing sale price of a Common Share on the trading day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the "Expiration Time"), the Issue Reference Price will be adjusted based on the following formula:
IRP1 = IRP0 x (SP1 x OS0)/(AC + (SP1 x OS1))
where
IRP0 = the Issue Reference Price in effect on the date such tender or exchange offer expires
IRP1 = the Issue Reference Price in effect on the day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires
AC = the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration (as determined by our board of trustees) paid or payable for shares purchased in such tender or exchange offer
OS0 = the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the date such tender or exchange offer expires
OS1 = the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after such tender or exchange offer expires (after giving effect to the purchase or conversion of shares pursuant to such tender or exchange offer)
 
20
 
SP1 = the average of the closing sale prices of Common Shares for the 10 consecutive trading days commencing on the trading day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires.
Any adjustment made pursuant to paragraph (iv) shall become effective on the date immediately following the Expiration Time. If the General Partner or one of its subsidiaries is obligated to purchase Common Shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the General Partner or such subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Issue Reference Price shall be prospectively adjusted to be the Issue Reference Price that would be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made.
The applicable Issue Reference Price will not be adjusted upon certain events, including but not limited to:
No adjustment in the applicable Issue Reference Price will be required unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of the applicable Issue Reference Price. If the adjustment is not made because the adjustment does not change the applicable Issue Reference Price by more than 1%, then the adjustment that is not made will be carried forward and taken into account in any future adjustment. All required calculations will be made to the nearest cent or 1/1000 of a share, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Series G-2 Preferred Units are called for redemption, all adjustments not previously made will be made on the applicable redemption date. Except as specifically described above, the applicable Issue
th
 
21
 
Reference Price will not be subject to adjustment in the case of the issuance of any Common Shares or preferred shares of the General Partner, or securities exchangeable for or convertible into Common Shares or preferred shares of the General Partner.

If, upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partnership or the General Partner, the assets of the Partnership, or proceeds thereof, distributable to the holders of Series G-3 Preferred Units shall be insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid and liquidating payments on any other Parity Units, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of the Series G-3 Preferred Units and the holders of any such other Parity Units ratably in accordance with the respective amounts that would be payable on such Series G-3 Preferred Units and any such other Parity Units if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full.

Subject to the rights of the holders of Partnership Units of any series or class or classes of shares ranking on a parity with or prior to the Series G-3 Preferred Units upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the General Partner or the Partnership, after payment shall have been made in full to the holders of the Series G-3 Preferred Units, as provided in this Section, any series or class or classes of Junior Units shall, subject to any respective terms and provisions applying thereto, be entitled to
 
-
13
-
 
receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holder of the Series G-3 Preferred Units shall not be entitled to share therein.
D.
          
The Partnership's Right to Redeem the Series G-3 Preferred Units
. (i) Except as set forth in Section 2.E below and the last sentence of this Section 2.D(i), the Series G-3 Preferred Units shall not be redeemable prior to the Permitted Redemption Date. On and after the Permitted Redemption Date, the General Partner may, at its option, cause the Partnership to redeem the Series G-3 Preferred Units in whole or in part, as set forth herein, subject to the provisions described below, at the applicable Redemption Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may, at its option, prior to the Permitted Redemption Date, cause the Partnership to redeem, subject to the provisions described below and at the applicable Redemption Price, any Series G-3 Preferred Units, in whole or in part, held by a holder (w) whose basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes in such Series G-3 Preferred Units is stepped-up under Section 1014 of the Code, (x) who is a qualified charitable institution or an Institutional Lender who has obtained such Series G-3 Preferred Units as a result of a default by the holder of such Series G-3 Preferred Units on a loan from the Institutional Lender, (y) to the extent the proceeds of such redemption will be used to satisfy (or reimburse itself for amounts paid with respect to) such holder's indemnification obligations pursuant to Article 6 of the Contribution Agreement or (z) who is a transferee from such holder described in clauses (w), (x) and (y) above.
(ii)
  
The Redemption Price in respect of each Series G-3 Preferred Unit shall be payable, at the election of the holder thereof, in (x) cash, (y) Class A Units (with each such Class A Unit valued at the applicable Redemption Reference Price), provided that in no event shall the Partnership be required to deliver fractional Class A Units or (z) the form of a Qualified Debt-Financed Distribution (or a combination of (x), (y) and (z)). The Partnership shall provide the holder of each Series G-3 Preferred Unit intended to be redeemed pursuant to this Section D not less than 61 calendar days notice of the date of such redemption. If the holder of any such Series G-3 Preferred Unit fails to elect the form in which the Redemption Price is to be paid on or prior to the 15 calendar day preceding such date of redemption in the manner prescribed in the notice of redemption given by the Partnership, such holder shall be deemed to have elected to receive the Redemption Price in cash. A Partner shall not be entitled to elect to receive Class A Units in payment of the Redemption Price if (but only as long as) the delivery of Class A Units to such Partner on the date of redemption would be prohibited under applicable federal or state securities laws or regulations. If fewer than all of the outstanding Series G-3 Preferred Units that are not held by the General Partner are to be redeemed, the Series G-3 Preferred Units to be redeemed from each holder (other than the General Partner) shall be selected pro rata (as nearly as practicable without creating fractional units). Any notice of redemption delivered pursuant to this Section 2.D(ii) will be (x) faxed and (y) mailed by certified mail, postage prepaid, not less than 61 calendar days prior to the date upon which such redemption is to occur (the "
th
Redemption Date
"), addressed to each holder of record of the Series G-3 Preferred Units at their respective addresses as they appear on the records of the Partnership. No immaterial defect in such notice shall affect the
 
-

validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any Series G-3 Preferred Units. In addition to any information required by law, each such notice shall state: (a) the Redemption Date, (b) the aggregate number of Series G-3 Preferred Units to be redeemed and, if fewer than all of the outstanding Series G-3 Preferred Units are to be redeemed, the number of Series G-3 Preferred Units to be redeemed held by such holder, which number shall equal such holder's pro rata share (based on the percentage of the aggregate number of outstanding Series G-3 Preferred Units that the total number of Series G-3 Preferred Units held by such holder represents and determined as nearly as practicable without creating fractional interests) of the aggregate number of Series G-3 Preferred Units to be redeemed, (c) the place or places where such Series G-3 Preferred Units are to be surrendered for payment of the amount payable upon redemption and (d)  that payment of such amount will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Series G-3 Preferred Units. If the Partnership gives a notice of redemption in respect of Series G-3 Preferred Units pursuant to this Section 2.D(ii), then, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Redemption Date, the Partnership will deposit irrevocably in trust for the benefit of the holders of Series G-3 Preferred Units being redeemed funds and/or Class A Units sufficient to pay the applicable amount payable with respect to such Series G-3 Preferred Units and will give irrevocable instructions and authority to pay such amount to the holders of the Series G-3 Preferred Units upon surrender of the Series G-3 Preferred Units by such holders at the place designated in the notice of redemption.
(iii)
 
Upon any redemption of Series G-3 Preferred Units, the Partnership shall pay any accumulated and unpaid distributions for any Distribution Period, or any other period shorter than a full Distribution Period, ending on or prior to the Redemption Date. On and after the Redemption Date, distributions will cease to accumulate on the Series G-3 Preferred Units called for redemption, unless the Partnership defaults in payment therefor. If any date fixed for redemption of Series G-3 Preferred Units is not a Unit Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Unit Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Unit Business Day falls in the next calendar year, such payment will be made on the immediately preceding Unit Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date fixed for redemption. If payment of the Redemption Price is improperly withheld or refused and not paid by the Partnership, distributions on such Series G-3 Preferred Units will continue to accumulate at the Applicable Distribution Rate from the original redemption date to the date of payment, in which case the actual payment date will be considered the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the applicable Redemption Price. Except as provided above, the Partnership shall make no payment or allowance for unpaid distributions, whether or not in arrears, on Series G-3 Preferred Units called for redemption under this Section 2.D.
(iv)
 
If full cumulative distributions on the Series G-3 Preferred Units and any other series or class or classes of Parity Units have not been paid or declared and set apart for payment, then except in fulfillment of an exercise of the redemption right set forth in Section 2.E below or, in the case of Parity Units, the exercise of any similar

redemption, conversion or other similar option granted concurrently with the issuance of such Parity Units, and except to the extent that such distributions or amounts distributable on the Series B-2 Restricted Preferred Units may not be payable due to a lack of funds in the Nongovernmental Account, the Series G-3 Preferred Units may not be redeemed in part and the Partnership may not purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire Series G-3 Preferred Units or any Parity Units other than in exchange for Junior Units.
(v)
  
Except as provided in Section 2.E below, as promptly as practicable after the surrender of any such Series G-3 Preferred Units so redeemed, such Series G-3 Preferred Units shall be exchanged for the amount of cash (without interest thereon), Qualified Debt Finance Distribution or Class A Units payable therefor pursuant to Section 2.D(i). If fewer than all the Series G-3 Preferred Units represented by any physical certificate are redeemed, then the Partnership shall issue new certificates representing the unredeemed Series G-3 Preferred Units without cost to the holder thereof.
(vi)
 
With respect to each redemption of Series G-3 Preferred Units caused by the General Partner pursuant to this Section 2.D (except for redemptions described in the last sentence of Section 2.D(i)), the Partnership shall either (i) cause the Redemption Date to occur on a date on which Qualified Debt Financed Distributions are available pursuant to Section 2.7(e) of the Contribution Agreement or (ii) agree to make Qualified Debt Financed Distributions available on such Redemption Date notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.7(e) of the Contribution Agreement.

General
. (a) Subject to paragraphs (ii) and (iii) below, on or after the third anniversary of the Series G-3 Effective Date (or on the Series G-3 Effective Date with respect to any Series G-3 Preferred Units held by a holder (v) whose basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes in such Series G-3 Preferred Units is stepped-up under Section 1014 of the Code, (w) who is a qualified charitable institution or an "Institutional Lender" who has obtained such Series G-3 Preferred Units as a result of a default by the holder of such Series G-3 Preferred Units on a loan from the Institutional Lender, (x) to the extent the proceeds of such redemption will be used to satisfy (or reimburse itself for amounts paid with respect to) such holder's indemnification obligations pursuant to Article 6 of the Contribution Agreement), (y) who is a transferee from any holder described in clauses (v), (w) and (x) above, or (z) to the extent such holder (or any of its Unit Distributees, as defined in the Contribution Agreement) elects to have the Redemption Price paid in the form of a Qualified Debt-Financed Distribution), with respect to each Series G-3 Preferred Unit, the holder of such Series G-3 Preferred Unit shall have the right (the "
Series G-3 Redemption Right
") to require the Partnership to redeem such Series G-3 Preferred Unit on any Series G-3 Specified Redemption Date at the applicable Redemption Price. Any such Series G-3 Redemption Right shall be exercised pursuant to notice of redemption comparable to the Notice of Redemption
 
-
16
-
 
required under Section 8.6 of the Agreement (a "
Series G-3 Notice of Redemption
") delivered to the Partnership (with a copy to the General Partner) by the Limited Partner who is exercising the Series G-3 Redemption Right (the "
Series G-3 Redeeming Partner
"). A holder of the Series G-3 Preferred Units may not exercise the Series G-3 Redemption Right in respect of less than 4,000 Series G-3 Preferred Units held by such holder or, if such holder holds less than 4,000 Series G-3 Preferred Units, all of the Series G-3 Preferred Units held by such holder on the date of the applicable Series G-3 Redemption Notice. Other than causing the Partnership to comply with its obligations hereunder, the General Partner shall not have any obligation to the Redeeming Partner or to the Partnership with respect to the Redeeming Partner's exercise of the Series G-3 Redemption Right. In addition, any redemption pursuant to the Series G-3 Redemption Right shall be subject to all of the provisions of the Agreement governing redemptions under Section 8.6 of the Agreement as if it were a redemption under that section, except as otherwise provided herein. The Redemption Price in respect of each Series G-3 Preferred Unit shall be payable, at the election of the holder thereof, in (x) cash or (y) the form of a Qualified Debt-Financed Distribution. If the holder of any such Series G-3 Preferred Unit fails to elect the form in which the Redemption Price is to be paid concurrently with the delivery of the Series G-3 Notice of Redemption, such holder shall be deemed to have elected to receive the Redemption Price in cash.
(b)
        
The Series G-3 Redeeming Partner shall have no right with respect to any Series G-3 Preferred Units so redeemed to receive any distributions paid after the Series G-3 Specified Redemption Date, unless the record date for the distribution preceded the Series G-3 Specified Redemption Date. If the record date for such distribution was a date prior to the Series G-3 Specified Redemption Date and the Distribution Payment Date in respect of such distribution was a date after the Series G-3 Specified Redemption Date, such Series G-3 Redeeming Partner shall be required, as a condition of the redemption of such Series G-3 Preferred Units, to pay the amount of such distribution to the Partnership.
(c)
         
The Assignee of any Limited Partner may exercise the rights of such Limited Partner pursuant to this Section 2.E, and such Limited Partner shall be deemed to have assigned such rights to such Assignee and shall be bound by the exercise of such rights by such Limited Partner's Assignee. In connection with any exercise of such rights by such Assignee on behalf of such Limited Partner, the Redemption Price and any accumulated and unpaid distributions shall be paid by the Partnership directly to such Assignee and not to such Limited Partner.
(d)
         
The Partnership shall give each holder of record of a Series G-3 Preferred Unit notice of any Change in Control within fifteen (15) days after the occurrence thereof. By notice to the Partnership delivered on or before the 20 Business Day after the date of the notice delivered pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, each holder of record of a Series G-3 Preferred Unit may elect to exercise such holder's rights under this Section 2.E with respect to all Series G-3 Preferred Units held by such holder notwithstanding that the Series G-3 Effective Date shall not have occurred.

No Liens on Partnership Units Delivered for Redemption
. Each holder of any Series G-3 Preferred Units covenants and agrees with the General Partner that all Series G-3 Preferred Units delivered for redemption shall be delivered to the Partnership or the General Partner, as the case may be, free and clear of all liens, and, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, neither the General Partner nor the Partnership shall be under any obligation to acquire Series G-3 Preferred Units which are or may be subject to any liens. Each holder of Series G-3 Preferred Units further agrees that, in the event any state or local property transfer tax is payable as a result of the transfer of its Series G-3 Preferred Units to the Partnership or the General Partner, such holder shall assume and pay such transfer tax.
(iv)
 
In addition to and without limiting any other rights or causes of action which a holder may have hereunder or at law or in equity, each holder shall be entitled to bring an action for specific performance in the event the Partnership defaults in its obligations under Section 2.D or this Section 2.E to redeem any Series G-3 Preferred Unit or to pay the associated Redemption Price in the amount and form required.

Schedule 2
The Issue Reference Price with respect to any particular Redemption Valuation Date shall be adjusted as follows if any of the events described below occur on or before such Redemption Valuation Date:
(i) If the General Partner issues Common Shares as a dividend or distribution on Common Shares to all holders of Common Shares, or if the General Partner effects a share split or share combination, the Issue Reference Price will be adjusted based on the following formula:
IRP1 = IRP0 x OS0/OS1
where
IRP0 = the Issue Reference Price in effect immediately prior to such event
IRP1 = the Issue Reference Price in effect immediately after such event
OS0 = the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to such event
OS1 = the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after such event.
Any adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph (i) shall become effective on the date that is immediately after the earlier of (x) the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution or (y) the date on which such split or combination becomes effective, as applicable. If any dividend or distribution described in this paragraph (i) is declared but not so paid or made, the Issue Reference Price shall be prospectively adjusted to the Issue Reference Price that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
(ii) If the General Partner issues to all holders of Common Shares any rights, warrants, options or other securities entitling them for a period of not more than 45 days after the date of issuance thereof to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares, or securities convertible into Common Shares within 45 days after the issuance thereof, in either case at an exercise price per share or a conversion price per share less than the closing sale price of Common Shares on the business day immediately preceding the time of announcement of such issuance, the Issue Reference Price will be adjusted based on the following formula (provided that the Issue Reference Price shall be prospectively adjusted to the Issue Reference Price that would be in effect to the extent that such rights, warrants, options, or other securities or convertible securities are not exercised or converted prior to the expiration of the exercisability or convertibility thereof):
IRP1 = IRP0 x (OS0+Y)/(OS0+X)
 
-
23
-
 
where
IRP0 = the Issue Reference Price in effect immediately prior to such event
IRP1 = the Issue Reference Price in effect immediately after such event
OS0 = the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to such event
X = the total number of Common Shares issuable pursuant to such rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities
Y = the number of Common Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities by (B) the average of the closing sale prices of Common Shares for the 10 consecutive trading days prior to the business day immediately preceding the date of announcement (or, if later, the ex-dividend date relating to such announcement) for the issuance of such rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities.
For purposes of paragraph (ii), in determining whether any rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities entitle the holder to subscribe for or purchase or exercise a conversion right for Common Shares at less than the average closing sale price of Common Shares, and in determining the aggregate exercise or conversion price payable for such Common Shares, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the General Partner for such rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the General Partner's board of trustees.
(iii) If the General Partner distributes shares of capital stock, evidences of indebtedness or other assets or property of the General Partner to all holders of Common Shares, excluding:
(A) dividends, distributions and rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities referred to in paragraph (i) or (ii) above,
(B) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash, and
(C) spin-offs described below in this paragraph (iii),
then the Issue Reference Price will be adjusted based on the following formula:
IRP1 = IRP0 x (SP0-FMV)/SPO
 
-
24
-
 
where
IRP0 = the Issue Reference Price in effect immediately prior to such distribution
IRP1 = the Issue Reference Price in effect immediately after such distribution
SP0 = the average of the closing sale prices of Common Shares for the 10 consecutive trading days prior to the business day immediately preceding the earlier of the record date or the ex-dividend date for such distribution
FMV = the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the General Partner's board of trustees) of the shares of capital stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets or property distributed with respect to each outstanding Common Share on the earlier of the record date or the ex-dividend date for such distribution.
An adjustment made pursuant to the above paragraph shall be made successively whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective on the day immediately after the date fixed for the determination of holders of Common Shares entitled to receive such distribution.
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to paragraph (iii) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on Common Shares or shares of capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit of the General Partner or the Partnership (such transaction, a "Spin-Off"), the Issue Reference Price in effect immediately before the close of business on the record date fixed for determination of holders of Common Shares entitled to receive the distribution will be adjusted based on the following formula:
IRP1 = IRP0 x MPO/(FMV0+MP0)
where
IRP0 = the Issue Reference Price in effect immediately prior to such distribution
IRP1 = the Issue Reference Price in effect immediately after such distribution
FMV0 = the average of the closing sale prices of the capital stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of Common Shares applicable to one Common Share over the first 10 consecutive trading days after the effective date of the Spin-Off or, if there is no regular market from which closing sale prices may be obtained, the fair market value (as determined
 
-
25
-
 
in good faith by the General Partner's board of trustees) of the capital stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of Common Shares applicable to one Common Share
MP0 = the average of the closing sale prices of Common Shares over the first 10 consecutive trading days after the effective date of the Spin-Off.
The adjustment to the Issue Reference Price under the preceding paragraph with respect to a Spin-Off will occur on the 10 trading day from, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off.
th
If any such dividend or distribution described in paragraph (iii) is declared but not paid or made, the Issue Reference Price shall be prospectively adjusted to be the Issue Reference Price that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
(iv) If the General Partner or any of its subsidiaries make a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for Common Shares to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per Common Share exceeds the closing sale price of a Common Share on the trading day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the "Expiration Time"), the Issue Reference Price will be adjusted based on the following formula:
IRP1 = IRP0 x (SP1 x OS0)/(AC + (SP1 x OS1))
where
IRP0 = the Issue Reference Price in effect on the date such tender or exchange offer expires
IRP1 = the Issue Reference Price in effect on the day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires
AC = the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration (as determined by our board of trustees) paid or payable for shares purchased in such tender or exchange offer
OS0 = the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the date such tender or exchange offer expires
OS1 = the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after such tender or exchange offer expires (after giving effect to the purchase or conversion of shares pursuant to such tender or exchange offer)
 
-
26
-
 
SP1 = the average of the closing sale prices of Common Shares for the 10 consecutive trading days commencing on the trading day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires.
Any adjustment made pursuant to paragraph (iv) shall become effective on the date immediately following the Expiration Time. If the General Partner or one of its subsidiaries is obligated to purchase Common Shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the General Partner or such subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Issue Reference Price shall be prospectively adjusted to be the Issue Reference Price that would be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made.
The applicable Issue Reference Price will not be adjusted upon certain events, including but not limited to:
No adjustment in the applicable Issue Reference Price will be required unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of the applicable Issue Reference Price. If the adjustment is not made because the adjustment does not change the applicable Issue Reference Price by more than 1%, then the adjustment that is not made will be carried forward and taken into account in any future adjustment. All required calculations will be made to the nearest cent or 1/1000 of a share, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Series G-3 Preferred Units are called for redemption, all adjustments not previously made will be made on the applicable redemption date. Except as specifically described above, the applicable Issue
th

Reference Price will not be subject to adjustment in the case of the issuance of any Common Shares or preferred shares of the General Partner, or securities exchangeable for or convertible into Common Shares or preferred shares of the General Partner.

distributions, as herein provided, on the Series G-4 Preferred Units. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any distribution payment or payments on the Series G-4 Preferred Units that may be in arrears.

So long as any Series G-4 Preferred Units are outstanding, no distributions, except as described in the immediately following sentence, shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any series or class or classes of Parity Units (as defined below) for any period unless full cumulative distributions have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payment on the Series G-4 Preferred Units for all Distribution Periods terminating on or prior to the distribution payment date on such class or series of Parity Units, except in the case of distributions on the Series B-2 Restricted Preferred Units to the extent not paid due to a lack of funds in the Nongovernmental Account.

(iv)
 
So long as any Series G-4 Preferred Units are outstanding, no distributions (other than distributions paid solely in Junior Units or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase Junior Units) shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment or other distribution declared or made upon Junior Units, nor shall any Junior Units be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired (other than a redemption, purchase or other acquisition of Junior Units made in respect of a redemption, purchase or other acquisition of Common Shares made for purposes of and in compliance with requirements of an employee incentive or benefit plan of the General Partner or any subsidiary), for any consideration (or any moneys to be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such Junior Units) by the General Partner, directly or indirectly (except by conversion into or exchange for Junior Units), unless in each case (a) the full cumulative distributions on all outstanding Series G-4 Preferred Units and any other Parity Units of the Partnership shall have been paid or set apart for payment for all past Distribution Periods with respect to the Series G-4 Preferred Units and all past distribution periods with respect to such Parity Units, except to the extent that distributions on the Series B-2 Restricted Preferred Units are not then able to be paid owing to a lack of funds in the Nongovernmental Account, and (b) sufficient funds shall have been paid or set apart for the payment of the distribution for the current Distribution Period with respect to the Series G-4 Preferred Units and any Parity Units, except to the extent that distributions on the Series B-2 Restricted Preferred Units are not then able to be paid owing to a lack of funds in the Nongovernmental Account.
C.
           
Liquidation Preference
. (i) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partnership or the General Partner, whether voluntary or
 
-
6
-
 
involuntary, before any payment or distribution of the assets of the Partnership shall be made to or set apart for the holders of Junior Units, holders of the Series G-4 Preferred Units shall be entitled to receive the Redemption Price plus an amount equal to all distributions (whether or not earned or declared) accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution to such holders, but the holders of Series G-4 Preferred Units shall not be entitled to any further payment. If, upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partnership or the General Partner, the assets of the Partnership, or proceeds thereof, distributable to the holders of Series G-4 Preferred Units shall be insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid and liquidating payments on any other Parity Units, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of the Series G-4 Preferred Units and the holders of any such other Parity Units ratably in accordance with the respective amounts that would be payable on such Series G-4 Preferred Units and any such other Parity Units if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. For the purposes of this Section 2.C and 2.G, (i) a consolidation or merger of the Partnership or the General Partner with one or more entities, (ii) a statutory share exchange by the Partnership or the General Partner and (iii) a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Partnership's or the General Partner's assets, shall not be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, of the Partnership or General Partner.
(ii)
  
Subject to the rights of the holders of Partnership Units of any series or class or classes of shares ranking on a parity with or prior to the Series G-4 Preferred Units upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the General Partner or the Partnership, after payment shall have been made in full to the holders of the Series G-4 Preferred Units, as provided in this Section, any series or class or classes of Junior Units shall, subject to any respective terms and provisions applying thereto, be entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holder of the Series G-4 Preferred Units shall not be entitled to share therein.
D.
          
The Partnership's Right to Redeem the Series G-4 Preferred Units
. (i) Except as set forth in Section 2.E below and the last sentence of this Section 2.D(i), the Series G-4 Preferred Units shall not be redeemable prior to the Permitted Redemption Date. On and after the Permitted Redemption Date, the General Partner may, at its option, cause the Partnership to redeem the Series G-4 Preferred Units in whole or in part, as set forth herein, subject to the provisions described below, at the applicable Redemption Price. Upon any such redemption, the Partnership shall also pay any accumulated and unpaid distributions owing in respect of the Series G-4 Preferred Units being redeemed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may, at its option, prior to the Permitted Redemption Date, cause the Partnership to redeem, subject to the provisions described below and at the applicable Redemption Price, any Series G-4 Preferred Units, in whole or in part, held by a holder (w) whose basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes in such Series G-4 Preferred Units is stepped-up under Section 1014 of the Code, (x) who is a qualified charitable institution or an Institutional Lender who has obtained such Series G-4 Preferred Units as a result of a default by the holder of such Series G-4 Preferred Units on a loan from the Institutional Lender, (y) to the extent the proceeds of
 
-
7
-
 
such redemption will be used to satisfy (or reimburse itself for amounts paid with respect to) such holder's indemnification obligations pursuant to Article 6 of the Contribution Agreement or (z) who is a transferee from such holder described in clauses (w), (x) and (y) above.
(ii)
  
The Redemption Price in respect of each Series G-4 Preferred Unit shall be payable, at the election of the holder thereof, in (x) cash, (y) Class A Units (with each such Class A Unit valued at the applicable Redemption Reference Price), provided that in no event shall the Partnership be required to deliver fractional Class A Units or (z) the form of a Qualified Debt-Financed Distribution (or a combination of (x), (y) and (z)). The Partnership shall provide the holder of each Series G-4 Preferred Unit intended to be redeemed pursuant to this Section D not less than 61 calendar days notice of the date of such redemption. If the holder of any such Series G-4 Preferred Unit fails to elect the form in which the Redemption Price is to be paid on or prior to the 15 calendar day preceding such date of redemption in the manner prescribed in the notice of redemption given by the Partnership, such holder shall be deemed to have elected to receive the Redemption Price in cash. A Partner shall not be entitled to elect to receive Class A Units in payment of the Redemption Price if (but only as long as) the delivery of Class A Units to such Partner on the date of redemption would be prohibited under applicable federal or state securities laws or regulations. If fewer than all of the outstanding Series G-4 Preferred Units that are not held by the General Partner are to be redeemed, the Series G-4 Preferred Units to be redeemed from each holder (other than the General Partner) shall be selected pro rata (as nearly as practicable without creating fractional units). Any notice of redemption delivered pursuant to this Section 2.D(ii) will be (x) faxed and (y) mailed by certified mail, postage prepaid, not less than 61 calendar days prior to the date upon which such redemption is to occur (the "
th
Redemption Date
"), addressed to each holder of record of the Series G-4 Preferred Units at their respective addresses as they appear on the records of the Partnership. No immaterial defect in such notice shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any Series G-4 Preferred Units. In addition to any information required by law, each such notice shall state: (a) the Redemption Date, (b) the aggregate number of Series G-4 Preferred Units to be redeemed and, if fewer than all of the outstanding Series G-4 Preferred Units are to be redeemed, the number of Series G-4 Preferred Units to be redeemed held by such holder, which number shall equal such holder's pro rata share (based on the percentage of the aggregate number of outstanding Series G-4 Preferred Units that the total number of Series G-4 Preferred Units held by such holder represents and determined as nearly as practicable without creating fractional interests) of the aggregate number of Series G-4 Preferred Units to be redeemed, (c) the place or places where such Series G-4 Preferred Units are to be surrendered for payment of the amount payable upon redemption and (d)  that payment of such amount will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Series G-4 Preferred Units. If the Partnership gives a notice of redemption in respect of Series G-4 Preferred Units pursuant to this Section 2.D(ii), then, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Redemption Date, the Partnership will deposit irrevocably in trust for the benefit of the holders of Series G-4 Preferred Units being redeemed funds and/or Class A Units sufficient to pay the applicable amount payable with respect to such Series G-4
 
-
8
-
 
Preferred Units and will give irrevocable instructions and authority to pay such amount to the holders of the Series G-4 Preferred Units upon surrender of the Series G-4 Preferred Units by such holders at the place designated in the notice of redemption.
(iii)
 
Upon any redemption of Series G-4 Preferred Units, the Partnership shall pay any accumulated and unpaid distributions for any Distribution Period, or any other period shorter than a full Distribution Period, ending on or prior to the Redemption Date. On and after the Redemption Date, distributions will cease to accumulate on the Series G-4 Preferred Units called for redemption, unless the Partnership defaults in payment therefor. If any date fixed for redemption of Series G-4 Preferred Units is not a Unit Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Unit Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Unit Business Day falls in the next calendar year, such payment will be made on the immediately preceding Unit Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date fixed for redemption. If payment of the Redemption Price is improperly withheld or refused and not paid by the Partnership, distributions on such Series G-4 Preferred Units will continue to accumulate at the Annual Distribution Rate from the original redemption date to the date of payment, in which case the actual payment date will be considered the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the applicable Redemption Price. Except as provided above, the Partnership shall make no payment or allowance for unpaid distributions, whether or not in arrears, on Series G-4 Preferred Units called for redemption under this Section 2.D.
(iv)
 
If full cumulative distributions on the Series G-4 Preferred Units and any other series or class or classes of Parity Units have not been paid or declared and set apart for payment, then except in fulfillment of an exercise of the redemption right set forth in Section 2.E below or, in the case of Parity Units, the exercise of any similar redemption, conversion or other similar option granted concurrently with the issuance of such Parity Units, and except to the extent that such distributions or amounts distributable on the Series B-2 Restricted Preferred Units may not be payable due to a lack of funds in the Nongovernmental Account, the Series G-4 Preferred Units may not be redeemed in part and the Partnership may not purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire Series G-4 Preferred Units or any Parity Units other than in exchange for Junior Units.
(v)
  
Except as provided in Section 2.E below, as promptly as practicable after the surrender of any such Series G-4 Preferred Units so redeemed, such Series G-4 Preferred Units shall be exchanged for the amount of cash (without interest thereon), Qualified Debt Financed Distribution or Class A Units payable therefor pursuant to Section 2.D(i). If fewer than all the Series G-4 Preferred Units represented by any physical certificate are redeemed, then the Partnership shall issue new certificates representing the unredeemed Series G-4 Preferred Units without cost to the holder thereof.

(vi)
 
With respect to each redemption of Series G-4 Preferred Units caused by the General Partner pursuant to this Section 2.D (except for redemptions described in the last sentence of Section 2.D(i)), the Partnership shall either (i) cause the Redemption Date to occur on a date on which Qualified Debt Financed Distributions are available pursuant to Section 2.7(e) of the Contribution Agreement or (ii) agree to make Qualified Debt Financed Distributions available on such Redemption Date notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.7(e) of the Contribution Agreement.

Series G-4 Redemption Right
") to require the Partnership to redeem such Series G-4 Preferred Unit on any Series G-4 Specified Redemption Date at the applicable Redemption Price. Any such Series G-4 Redemption Right shall be exercised pursuant to notice of redemption comparable to the Notice of Redemption required under Section 8.6 of the Agreement (a "
Series G-4 Notice of Redemption
") delivered to the Partnership (with a copy to the General Partner) by the Limited Partner who is exercising the Series G-4 Redemption Right (the "
Series G-4 Redeeming Partner
"). A holder of the Series G-4 Preferred Units may not exercise the Series G-4 Redemption Right in respect of less than 4,000 Series G-4 Preferred Units held by such holder or, if such holder holds less than 4,000 Series G-4 Preferred Units, all of the Series G-4 Preferred Units held by such holder on the date of the applicable Series G-4 Redemption Notice. Other than causing the Partnership to comply with its obligations hereunder, the General Partner shall not have any obligation to the Redeeming Partner or to the Partnership with respect to the Redeeming Partner's exercise of the Series G-4 Redemption Right. In addition, any redemption pursuant to the Series G-4 Redemption Right shall be subject to all of the provisions of the Agreement governing redemptions under Section 8.6 of the Agreement as if it were a redemption under that section, except as otherwise provided herein. The Redemption Price in respect of each Series G-4 Preferred Unit shall be payable, at the election of the holder thereof, in (x) cash or (y) the form of a Qualified Debt-Financed Distribution. If the holder of any such Series G-4 Preferred Unit fails to elect the form in which the Redemption Price is to be paid

concurrently with the delivery of the Series G-4 Notice of Redemption, such holder shall be deemed to have elected to receive the Redemption Price in cash.
(b)
        
The Series G-4 Redeeming Partner shall have no right with respect to any Series G-4 Preferred Units so redeemed to receive any distributions paid after the Series G-4 Specified Redemption Date, unless the record date for the distribution preceded the Series G-4 Specified Redemption Date. If the record date for such distribution was a date prior to the Series G-4 Specified Redemption Date and the Distribution Payment Date in respect of such distribution was a date after the Series G-4 Specified Redemption Date, such Series G-4 Redeeming Partner shall be required, as a condition of the redemption of such Series G-4 Preferred Units, to pay the amount of such distribution to the Partnership.
(c)
         
The Assignee of any Limited Partner may exercise the rights of such Limited Partner pursuant to this Section 2.E, and such Limited Partner shall be deemed to have assigned such rights to such Assignee and shall be bound by the exercise of such rights by such Limited Partner's Assignee. In connection with any exercise of such rights by such Assignee on behalf of such Limited Partner, the Redemption Price and any accumulated and unpaid distributions shall be paid by the Partnership directly to such Assignee and not to such Limited Partner.
(d)
         
The Partnership shall give each holder of record of a Series G-4 Preferred Unit notice of any Change in Control within fifteen (15) days after the occurrence thereof. By notice to the Partnership delivered on or before the 20 Business Day after the date of the notice delivered pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, each holder of record of a Series G-4 Preferred Unit may elect to exercise such holder's rights under this Section 2.E with respect to all Series G-4 Preferred Units held by such holder notwithstanding that the Series G-4 Effective Date shall not have occurred.

(iii)
 
No Liens on Partnership Units Delivered for Redemption
. Each holder of any Series G-4 Preferred Units covenants and agrees with the General Partner that all Series G-4 Preferred Units delivered for redemption shall be delivered to the Partnership or the General Partner, as the case may be, free and clear of all liens, and, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, neither the General Partner nor the Partnership shall be under any obligation to acquire Series G-4 Preferred Units which are or may be subject to any liens. Each holder of Series G-4 Preferred Units further agrees that, in the event any state or local property transfer tax is payable as a result of the transfer of its Series G-4 Preferred Units to the Partnership or the General Partner, such holder shall assume and pay such transfer tax.
(iv)
 
In addition to and without limiting any other rights or causes of action which a holder may have hereunder or at law or in equity, each holder shall be entitled to bring an action for specific performance in the event the Partnership defaults in its

obligations under Section 2.D or this Section 2.E to redeem any Series G-4 Preferred Unit or to pay the associated Redemption Price in the amount and form required.
F.

(b)
          
on a parity with the Series G-4 Preferred Units, as to the payment of distributions and as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the General Partner or the Partnership, whether or not the distribution rates, distribution payment dates or redemption or liquidation prices per Partnership Unit be different from those of the Series G-4 Preferred Units, if the holders of such Partnership Units of such class or series and the Series G-4 Preferred Units shall be entitled to the receipt of distributions and of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up in proportion to their respective amounts of accrued and unpaid distributions per Partnership Unit or liquidation preferences, without preference or priority one over the other, except to the extent that such distributions or amounts distributable on the Series B-2 Restricted Preferred Units may not be payable due to a lack of funds in the Nongovernmental Account ("
Parity Units
"); and
(c)
          
junior to the Series G-4 Preferred Units, as to the payment of distributions or as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the General Partner or the Partnership, if such class or series of Partnership Units shall be Common Partnership Units or if the holders of Series G-4 Preferred Units shall be entitled to receipt of distributions or of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of Partnership Units of such class or series ("

(a)
          
The Series G-4 Preferred Units shall be Preference Units and shall receive distributions on a basis
pari
passu
with other Partnership Units, if any, receiving distributions pursuant to Section 5.1.B(i) of the Agreement, except to the extent that distributions on the Series B-2 Restricted Preferred Units may not be paid due to a lack of funds in the Nongovernmental Account.
(b)
         
Distributions made pursuant to Subsection 2.G(ii)(a) of this
Exhibit AM
shall be made pro rata with other distributions made to other Partnership Units as to which they rank
pari
passu
based on the ratio of the amounts to be paid the Series G-4 Preferred Units and such other Partnership Units, as applicable, to the total amounts to be paid in respect of the Series G-4 Preferred Units and such other Partnership Units taken together on the Partnership Record Date, except in the case of distributions on the Series B-2 Restricted Preferred Units to the extent such distributions may not be paid due to a lack of funds in the Nongovernmental Account.
(iii)
 
The initial balance of the portion of the initial holder's Capital Account attributable to each Series G-4 Preferred Unit shall be equal to $25.00. This amount will be reduced by distributions and allocations of losses made with respect to each such Series G-4 Preferred Unit and increased by allocations of income with respect to each such Series G-4 Preferred Unit. For purposes of allocations of items made pursuant to Article VI of the Agreement, the Series G-4 Preferred Units shall be Preference Units and the portion of the holder's Capital Account attributable to each
 
-
13
-
 
Series G-4 Preferred Unit shall be allocated (i) income in an amount equal to the amount of distributions in respect of such Series G-4 Preferred Unit in accordance with Section 6.1.A(ii) and (ii) items of loss in accordance with Section 6.1.B(x) of the Agreement, and shall share in those allocations in a pro rata manner based on the distributions and allocations of items, as applicable, made to Preference Units; references to Preference Units in Article VI of the Agreement shall be deemed to also refer to Series G-4 Preferred Units except that references to distributions made to Preference Units shall be deemed to refer to distributions made to the Series G-4 Preferred Units in a pro rata manner with such distributions, if any, made to the Preference Units. As a result, the portion of each holder's Capital Account attributable to a Series G-4 Preferred Unit will generally be allocated income equal to the cash distributed in respect of such Series G-4 Preferred Unit (and losses previously allocated to them). This allocation would occur prior to any allocation of income to Units other than Preference Units. In the event the Partnership incurs an amount of losses in excess of the aggregate amount of the Capital Accounts with respect to the Units (other than Preference Units), any additional loss would be allocated to the holders of the Series G-4 Preferred Units in accordance with Section 6.1.B(x) of the Agreement.
H.
          
Voting
. (i) Except as provided in this Section 2.H or as required by law, the holders of the Series G-4 Preferred Units shall not be entitled to vote at any meeting of the Partners or for any other purpose or otherwise to participate in any action taken by the Partnership or the Partners, or to receive notice of any meeting of the Partners.
(ii)
  
So long as any Series G-4 Preferred Units are outstanding, the General Partner shall not authorize the creation of or cause the Partnership to issue Partnership Units of any class or series or any interest in the Partnership convertible into or exchangeable for Partnership Units of any class or series ranking prior to the Series G-4 Preferred Units in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the General Partner or the Partnership or in the payment of distributions, or reclassify any Partnership Units of the Partnership into any such senior Partnership Units;
I.
            
General
. (i) At such time, if any, as the General Partner becomes a holder of Series G-4 Preferred Units, the rights of the General Partner, in its capacity as the holder of the Series G-4 Preferred Units, will be in addition to and not in limitation of any other rights or authority of the General Partner, in any other capacity, under the Agreement. In addition, nothing contained in this
Exhibit AM
shall be deemed to limit or otherwise restrict any rights or authority of the General Partner under the Agreement, other than in its capacity as the holder of Series G-4 Preferred Units.
Assignees
. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 11.5 of the Agreement shall apply in respect of any Assignee of Series G-4 Preferred Units. The Assignee of any Series G-4 Preferred Units may exercise the rights of a Limited Partner pursuant to Section 2.D of this Amendment and such Limited Partner shall be deemed to have
 
-

-
 
assigned such rights to such Limited Partner's Assignee and shall be bound by the exercise of such rights by such Limited Partner's Assignee.

Such distributions with respect to each Series G-1 Preferred Unit shall be cumulative from the date of issuance of such Series G-1 Preferred Unit and shall be payable quarterly, when, as and if authorized and declared by the General Partner, in arrears on Distribution Payment Dates, commencing on the first Distribution Payment Date after June 28, 2007. Distributions are cumulative from the most recent Distribution Payment Date to which distributions have been paid.

No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any distribution payment or payments on the Series G-1 Preferred Units that may be in arrears.

If, upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partnership or the General Partner, the assets of the Partnership, or proceeds thereof, distributable to the holders of Series G-1 Preferred Units shall be insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid and liquidating payments on any other Parity Units, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of the Series G-1 Preferred Units and the holders of any such other Parity Units ratably in accordance with the respective amounts that would be payable on

The Partnership's Right to Redeem the Series G-1 Preferred Units
. (i) Except as set forth in Section 2.E below and the last sentence of this Section 2.D(i), the Series G-1 Preferred Units shall not be redeemable prior to the Permitted Redemption Date. On and after the Permitted Redemption Date, the General Partner may, at its option, cause the Partnership to redeem the Series G-1 Preferred Units in whole or in part, as set forth herein, subject to the provisions described below, at the applicable Redemption Price. Upon any such redemption, the Partnership shall also pay any accumulated and unpaid distributions owing in respect of the Series G-1 Preferred Units being redeemed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may, at its option, prior to the Permitted Redemption Date, cause the Partnership to redeem, subject to the provisions described below and at the applicable Redemption Price, any Series G-1 Preferred Units, in whole or in part, held by a holder (w) whose basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes in such Series G-1 Preferred Units is stepped-up under Section 1014 of the Code, (x) who is a qualified charitable institution or an Institutional Lender who has obtained such Series G-1 Preferred Units as a result of a default by the holder of such Series G-1 Preferred Units on a loan from the Institutional Lender, (y) to the extent the proceeds of such redemption will be used to satisfy (or reimburse itself for amounts paid with respect to) such holder's indemnification obligations pursuant to Article 6 of the Contribution Agreement or (z) who is a transferee from such holder described in clauses (w), (x) and (y) above.
(ii)
  
The Redemption Price in respect of each Series G-1 Preferred Unit shall be payable, at the election of the holder thereof, in (x) cash, (y) Class A Units (with each such Class A Units valued at the applicable Redemption Reference Price), provided that in no event shall the Partnership be required to deliver fractional Class A Units or (z) the form of a Qualified Debt-Financed Distribution (or a combination (x), (y) and (z)). The Partnership shall provide the holder of each Series G-1 Preferred Unit intended to be redeemed pursuant to this Section D not less than 61 calendar days notice of the date of
 
-
8
-
 
such redemption. If the holder of any such Series G-1 Preferred Unit fails to elect the form in which the Redemption Price is to be paid on or prior to the 15 calendar day preceding such date of redemption in the manner prescribed in the notice of redemption given by the Partnership, such holder shall be deemed to have elected to receive the Redemption Price in cash. A Partner shall not be entitled to elect to receive Class A Units in payment of the Redemption Price if (but only as long as) the delivery of Class A Units to such Partner on the date of redemption would be prohibited under applicable federal or state securities laws or regulations. If fewer than all of the outstanding Series G-1 Preferred Units that are not held by the General Partner are to be redeemed, the Series G-1 Preferred Units to be redeemed from each holder (other than the General Partner) shall be selected pro rata (as nearly as practicable without creating fractional units). Any notice of redemption delivered pursuant to this Section 2.D(ii) will be (x) faxed and (y) mailed by certified mail, postage prepaid, not less than 61 calendar days prior to the date upon which such redemption is to occur (the "
th
Redemption Date
"), addressed to each holder of record of the Series G-1 Preferred Units at their respective addresses as they appear on the records of the Partnership. No immaterial defect in such notice shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any Series G-1 Preferred Units. In addition to any information required by law, each such notice shall state: (a) the Redemption Date, (b) the aggregate number of Series G-1 Preferred Units to be redeemed and, if fewer than all of the outstanding Series G-1 Preferred Units are to be redeemed, the number of Series G-1 Preferred Units to be redeemed held by such holder, which number shall equal such holder's pro rata share (based on the percentage of the aggregate number of outstanding Series G-1 Preferred Units that the total number of Series G-1 Preferred Units held by such holder represents and determined as nearly as practicable without creating fractional interests) of the aggregate number of Series G-1 Preferred Units to be redeemed, (c) the place or places where such Series G-1 Preferred Units are to be surrendered for payment of the amount payable upon redemption and (d)  that payment of such amount will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Series G-1 Preferred Units. If the Partnership gives a notice of redemption in respect of Series G-1 Preferred Units pursuant to this Section 2.D(ii), then, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Redemption Date, the Partnership will deposit irrevocably in trust for the benefit of the holders of Series G-1 Preferred Units being redeemed funds and/or Class A Units sufficient to pay the applicable amount payable with respect to such Series G-1 Preferred Units and will give irrevocable instructions and authority to pay such amount to the holders of the Series G-1 Preferred Units upon surrender of the Series G-1 Preferred Units by such holders at the place designated in the notice of redemption.
(iii)
 
Upon any redemption of Series G-1 Preferred Units, the Partnership shall pay any accumulated and unpaid distributions for any Distribution Period, or any other period shorter than a full Distribution Period, ending on or prior to the Redemption Date. On and after the Redemption Date, distributions will cease to accumulate on the Series G-1 Preferred Units called for redemption, unless the Partnership defaults in payment therefor. If any date fixed for redemption of Series G-1 Preferred Units is not a Unit Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Unit Business Day (and without any interest or
 
-
9
-
 
other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Unit Business Day falls in the next calendar year, such payment will be made on the immediately preceding Unit Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date fixed for redemption. If payment of the Redemption Price is improperly withheld or refused and not paid by the Partnership, distributions on such Series G-1 Preferred Units will continue to accumulate at the Applicable Distribution Rate from the original redemption date to the date of payment, in which case the actual payment date will be considered the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the applicable Redemption Price. Except as provided above, the Partnership shall make no payment or allowance for unpaid distributions, whether or not in arrears, on Series G-1 Preferred Units called for redemption under this Section 2.D.
(iv)
 
If full cumulative distributions on the Series G-1 Preferred Units and any other series or class or classes of Parity Units have not been paid or declared and set apart for payment, then except in fulfillment of an exercise of the redemption right set forth in Section 2.E below or, in the case of Parity Units, the exercise of any similar redemption, conversion or other similar option granted concurrently with the issuance of such Parity Units, and except to the extent that such distributions or amounts distributable on the Series B-2 Restricted Preferred Units may not be payable due to a lack of funds in the Nongovernmental Account, the Series G-1 Preferred Units may not be redeemed in part and the Partnership may not purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire Series G-1 Preferred Units or any Parity Units other than in exchange for Junior Units.
(v)
  
Except as provided in Section 2.E below, as promptly as practicable after the surrender of any such Series G-1 Preferred Units so redeemed, such Series G-1 Preferred Units shall be exchanged for the amount of cash (without interest thereon), Qualified Debt Financed Distribution or Class A Units payable therefor pursuant to Section 2.D(i). If fewer than all the Series G-1 Preferred Units represented by any physical certificate are redeemed, then the Partnership shall issue new certificates representing the unredeemed Series G-1 Preferred Units without cost to the holder thereof.
(vi)
 
With respect to each redemption of Series G-1 Preferred Units caused by the General Partner pursuant to this Section 2.D (except for redemptions described in the last sentence of Section 2.D(i)), the Partnership shall either (i) cause the Redemption Date to occur on a date on which Qualified Debt Financed Distributions are available pursuant to Section 2.7(e) of the Contribution Agreement or (ii) agree to make Qualified Debt Financed Distributions available on such Redemption Date notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.7(e) of the Contribution Agreement.

U.S. federal income tax purposes in such Series G-1 Preferred Units is stepped-up under Section 1014 of the Code, (w) who is a qualified charitable institution or an "Institutional Lender" who has obtained such Series G-1 Preferred Units as a result of a default by the holder of such Series G-1 Preferred Units on a loan from the Institutional Lender, (x) to the extent the proceeds of such redemption will be used to satisfy (or reimburse itself for amounts paid with respect to) such holder's indemnification obligations pursuant to Article 6 of the Contribution Agreement), (y) who is a transferee from any holder described in clauses (v), (w) and (x) above, or (z) to the extent such holder (or any of its Unit Distributees, as defined in the Contribution Agreement) elects to have the Redemption Price paid in the form of a Qualified Debt-Financed Distribution), with respect to each Series G-1 Preferred Unit, the holder of such Series G-1 Preferred Unit shall have the right (the "
Series G-1 Redemption Right
") to require the Partnership to redeem such Series G-1 Preferred Unit on any Series G-1 Specified Redemption Date at the applicable Redemption Price. Any such Series G-1 Redemption Right shall be exercised pursuant to notice of redemption comparable to the Notice of Redemption required under Section 8.6 of the Agreement (a "
Series G-1 Notice of Redemption
") delivered to the Partnership (with a copy to the General Partner) by the Limited Partner who is exercising the Series G-1 Redemption Right (the "
Series G-1 Redeeming Partner
"). A holder of the Series G-1 Preferred Units may not exercise the Series G-1 Redemption Right in respect of less than 4,000 Series G-1 Preferred Units held by such holder or, if such holder holds less than 4,000 Series G-1 Preferred Units, all of the Series G-1 Preferred Units held by such holder on the date of the applicable Series G-1 Redemption Notice. Other than causing the Partnership to comply with its obligations hereunder, the General Partner shall not have any obligation to the Redeeming Partner or to the Partnership with respect to the Redeeming Partner's exercise of the Series G-1 Redemption Right. In addition, any redemption pursuant to the Series G-1 Redemption Right shall be subject to all of the provisions of the Agreement governing redemptions under Section 8.6 of the Agreement as if it were a redemption under that section, except as otherwise provided herein. The Redemption Price in respect of each Series G-1 Preferred Unit shall be payable, at the election of the holder thereof, in (x) cash or (y) the form of a Qualified Debt-Financed Distribution. If the holder of any such Series G-1 Preferred Unit fails to elect the form in which the Redemption Price is to be paid concurrently with the delivery of the Series G-1 Notice of Redemption, such holder shall be deemed to have elected to receive the Redemption Price in cash.
(b)
        
The Series G-1 Redeeming Partner shall have no right with respect to any Series G-1 Preferred Units so redeemed to receive any distributions paid after the Series G-1 Specified Redemption Date, unless the record date for the distribution preceded the Series G-1 Specified Redemption Date. If the record date for such distribution was a date prior to the Series G-1 Specified Redemption Date and the Distribution Payment Date in respect of such distribution was a date after the Series G-1 Specified Redemption Date, such Series G-1 Redeeming Partner shall be required, as a condition of the redemption of such Series G-1 Preferred Units, to pay the amount of such distribution to the Partnership.

The Assignee of any Limited Partner may exercise the rights of such Limited Partner pursuant to this Section 2.E, and such Limited Partner shall be deemed to have assigned such rights to such Assignee and shall be bound by the exercise of such rights by such Limited Partner's Assignee. In connection with any exercise of such rights by such Assignee on behalf of such Limited Partner, the Redemption Price and any accumulated and unpaid distributions shall be paid by the Partnership directly to such Assignee and not to such Limited Partner.
(d)
         
The Partnership shall give each holder of record of a Series G-1 Preferred Unit notice of any Change in Control within fifteen (15) days after the occurrence thereof. By notice to the Partnership delivered on or before the 20 Business Day after the date of the notice delivered pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, each holder of record of a Series G-1 Preferred Unit may elect to exercise such holder's rights under Section 2.D or this Section 2.E with respect to all Series G-1 Preferred Units held by such holder notwithstanding that the Series G-1 Effective Date shall not have occurred.

No Liens on Partnership Units Delivered for Redemption
. Each holder of any Series G-1 Preferred Units covenants and agrees with the General Partner that all Series G-1 Preferred Units delivered for redemption shall be delivered to the Partnership or the General Partner, as the case may be, free and clear of all liens, and, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, neither the General Partner nor the Partnership shall be under any obligation to acquire Series G-1 Preferred Units which are or may be subject to any liens. Each holder of Series G-1 Preferred Units further agrees that, in the event any state or local property transfer tax is payable as a result of the transfer of its Series G-1 Preferred Units to the Partnership or the General Partner, such holder shall assume and pay such transfer tax.
(iv)
 
In addition to and without limiting any other rights or causes of action which a holder may have hereunder or at law or in equity, each holder shall be entitled to bring an action for specific performance in the event the Partnership defaults in its obligations under this Section 2.E to redeem any Series G-1 Preferred Unit or to pay the associated Redemption Price in the amount and form required.
F.
           
Conversion

Distributions made pursuant to Subsection 2.G(ii)(a) of this
Exhibit AJ
shall be made pro rata with other distributions made to other Partnership Units as to which they rank
pari
passu
based on the ratio of the amounts to be paid the Series G-1 Preferred Units and such other Partnership Units, as applicable, to the total amounts to be paid in respect of the Series G-1 Preferred Units and such other Partnership Units taken together on the Partnership Record Date, except in the case of distributions on the Series B-2 Restricted Preferred Units to the extent such distributions may not be paid due to a lack of funds in the Nongovernmental Account.
(iii)
 
The initial balance of the portion of the initial holder's Capital Account attributable to each Series G-1 Preferred Unit shall be equal to $25.00. This amount will be reduced by distributions and allocations of losses made with respect to each such Series G-1 Preferred Unit and increased by allocations of income with respect to each such Series G-1 Preferred Unit. For purposes of allocations of items made pursuant to Article VI of the Agreement, the Series G-1 Preferred Units shall be Preference Units and the portion of the holder's Capital Account attributable to each Series G-1 Preferred Unit shall be allocated (i) income in an amount equal to the amount of distributions in respect of such Series G-1 Preferred Unit in accordance with Section 6.1.A(ii) and (ii) items of loss in accordance with Section 6.1.B(x) of the Agreement, and shall share in those allocations in a pro rata manner based on the distributions and allocations of items, as applicable, made to Preference Units; references to Preference Units in Article VI of the Agreement shall be deemed to also refer to Series G-1 Preferred Units except that references to distributions made to Preference Units shall be deemed to refer to distributions made to the Series G-1 Preferred Units in a pro rata manner with such distributions, if any, made to the Preference Units.

-
14
-
 
Series G-1 Preferred Unit (and losses previously allocated to them). This allocation would occur prior to any allocation of income to Units other than Preference Units. In the event the Partnership incurs an amount of losses in excess of the aggregate amount of the Capital Accounts with respect to the Units (other than Preference Units), any additional loss would be allocated to the holders of the Series G-1 Preferred Units in accordance with Section 6.1.B(x) of the Agreement.
