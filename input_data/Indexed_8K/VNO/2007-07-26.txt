Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
 
On May 24, 2007, Vornado Realty L.P. completed its previously announced acquisition of a 70% controlling interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas, a 2.0 million square foot Manhattan office building, located on the entire blockfront between 51st and 52nd Streets on Avenue of the Americas, and the 555 California Street office complex containing 1.8 million square feet, known as the Bank of America Center, located at California and Montgomery Streets in San Francisco's financial district. In connection with the acquisition, Vornado Realty L.P. and Vornado Realty Trust filed a Current Report on Form 8-K/A describing the acquisition. Reference is made to that Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 24, 2007. This Current Report on Form 8-K/A amends that prior filing. The purchase price for Vornado's 70% interest in the real estate was approximately $1.807 billion, consisting of $1.010 billion of cash and $797 million of existing debt. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is approximately $775 per square foot for 1290 Avenue of the Americas and approximately $575 per square foot for 555 California Street, based on current measurement of the buildings. The purchase was effected through the acquisition by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vornado Realty L.P. of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies that own, indirectly through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership interest and limited partnership interests comprising 69% of the partnerships that own the two properties. The remaining 30% limited partnership interest is owned by Donald J. Trump.

Vornado Realty Trust
Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information
(in thousands)
 
Basis of Pro Forma Presentation
 
The unaudited consolidated pro forma financial information presents, (i) the consolidated pro forma balance sheet of Vornado Realty Trust ("Vornado") as of December 31, 2006, as if the purchase of the 70% interest in 1290 Avenue of the America and the 555 California Street complex (together, the "Properties Acquired") occurred on December 31, 2006, and (ii) the consolidated pro forma income statements of Vornado Realty Trust for the year ended December 31, 2006 and for the three months ended March 31, 2007, as if the above transaction had occurred on January 1, 2006. The accompanying pro forma financial information is presented on the basis of consolidation of the Properties Acquired, because Vornado is acquiring a 70% controlling equity interest. The purchase price accounting adjustments included herein represent a preliminary allocation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired and are subject to change within the one-year period from the date of acquisition, as further valuation information becomes available.
 
The unaudited consolidated pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what Vornado's actual results of operations or financial position would have been had this transaction been consummated on the dates indicated, nor does it purport to represent Vornado's results of operations or financial position for any future period. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2007 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year.
 
The unaudited consolidated pro forma financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Vornado's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2007, and the statements of revenues and certain expenses of the Properties Acquired and notes thereto included in this current report on Form 8-K. In our opinion, all adjustments necessary to reflect this transaction have been made.

Supplemental Information
Pro Forma Funds From Operations ("FFO")
For the Year Ended December 31, 2006
FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus specified non-cash items, such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity REITs. FFO and FFO per diluted share should be evaluated along with GAAP net income and income per diluted share (the most directly comparable GAAP measures), as well as cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, in evaluating the operating performance of equity REITs. Management believes that FFO and FFO per diluted share are helpful to investors as supplemental performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, these non-GAAP measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in our statements of cash flows. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

Supplemental Information
Pro Forma EBITDA by Segment
EBITDA represents "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization." We consider EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the un-levered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Vornado Realty Trust
 
We have audited the accompanying statement of revenues and certain expenses of 1290 Avenue of the Americas (the "Property") for the year ended December 31, 2006. The financial statement is the responsibility of the Property's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this financial statement based on our audit.
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the statement of revenues and certain expenses is free from material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the statement of revenues and certain expenses. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
The accompanying statement of revenues and certain expenses was prepared for the purpose of complying with Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission for inclusion in Form 8-K of Vornado Realty Trust and is not intended to be a complete presentation of the Property's revenues and expenses.
 
In our opinion, the financial statement referred to above presents fairly, in all material respects, the revenues and certain expenses of the Property as described in Note 1, for the year ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO STATEMENT OF REVENUES AND CERTAIN EXPENSES
 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006
 
 
Presented herein is the statement of revenues and certain expenses related to the operation of an office building located at 1290 Avenue of the Americas (the "Property") in Manhattan, New York. During 2007 Vornado Realty Trust (the "Company") signed a contract to purchase a controlling interest in the entity which owns the Property (the "LLC").
 
The accompanying financial statement has been prepared in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for the acquisition of real estate properties. Accordingly, the financial statement excludes interest income and certain expenses that may not be comparable to those expected to be incurred by the Company in the proposed future operations of the aforementioned property. Items excluded consist of depreciation and amortization, and general and administrative expenses not directly related to the future operations.
 
The preparation of the statement of revenues and certain expenses in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the statement of revenues and certain expenses and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
The Property is being leased to tenants under operating leases. Minimum rental income is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The excess of amounts so recognized over amounts due pursuant to the underlying leases amounted to $1,074,924 (unaudited) for the three months ended March 31, 2007 and $6,299,017 for the year ended December 31, 2006.
 
The Property has leases with tenants expiring at various dates to July 31, 2020. Approximate future minimum annual base rental payments to be received are as follows:
 
 
 
The lease agreements generally contain provisions for reimbursement of real estate taxes and operating expenses over base year amounts, as well as fixed increases in rent.

NOTES TO STATEMENT OF REVENUES AND CERTAIN EXPENSES
 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006
 
The first note ("Note A") in the amount of $385,000,000 has an interest rate of 6.8527%. The second note ("Note B") in the amount of $55,000,000 has an interest rate of 6.5907%. Note A and Note B (the "Notes") require monthly payments of interest only through July 7, 2007. Commencing August 7, 2007 through January 7, 2012 the LLC will make monthly payments of $2,745,010 on the Notes, applied first to interest with the balance in reduction of principal. Commencing February 7, 2012 the LLC will make monthly payments of interest only. The Notes mature on January 7, 2013. The Property is pledged as collateral for the Notes. The future maturities of long-term debt as of December 31, 2006 are approximately as follows:
 
 
 
The Notes require the maintenance of escrow and reserve accounts. Further, the Notes require the LLC to maintain a lockbox account for the receipt of operating lease rental income, whereby the lockbox funds are first used to fund debt service and escrow and reserve accounts prior to the release of such funds to the operating accounts. In addition, individuals affiliated with the LLC have personally guaranteed certain obligations of the Notes in certain limited circumstances, as described in the loan agreements.
 
The Property was managed pursuant to a management agreement, which provided for fees based primarily upon gross receipts, as defined.
 
Two tenants occupied approximately 50% of the building's square footage and accounted for approximately 50% of the rental revenue.
 
The statement of revenues and certain expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2007 is unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the statement of revenues and certain expenses for the interim period have been included. The results of interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be obtained for a full fiscal year.
