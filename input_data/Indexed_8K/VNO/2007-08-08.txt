Item 8.01. Other Events
 
On August 8, 2007, Vornado Realty L.P. (the "Company"), the operating partnership through which Vornado Realty Trust ("Vornado") conducts substantially all of its business, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 which contained a subsequent event footnote regarding its investment in McDonald's Corporation ("McDonald's") (NYSE: MCD). Vornado is electing to file this current report on Form 8-K to update the disclosure contained in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 filed with the SEC on July 31, 2007.
 
Subsequent Event
As of June 30, 2007, we owned 13,695,500 McDonald's Corporation ("McDonald's") (NYSE: MCD) option shares at a carrying amount of $50.76 per share. These options were scheduled to expire on various dates between July 30, 2007 and September 10, 2007. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of Vornado's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 for additional details regarding this investment. Principally, on August 2, 2007, we net settled all of the options at a weighted average price of $48.54 per share and received $193,727,000 in cash and simultaneously entered into a new derivative position covering 11,113,700 McDonald's option shares on substantially the same terms as the initial options at a strike price of $48.27 per share. The new derivative position expires in August 2010. On August 6, 2007, we net settled 1,000,000 of the options in the new position at a price of $49.21 per share.
 
Based on McDonald's August 7, 2007 closing common stock price of $49.73, our aggregate net gain from inception of our investments in McDonald's is $230,342,000.
