Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On September 28, 2007, Vornado Realty L.P. (the "Company"), the operating partnership through which Vornado Realty Trust ("Vornado") conducts its business, entered into a new $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Agreement"), which can be increased during the initial term to $2.0 billion. The new facility has a three-year term with two one-year extension options and bears interest at LIBOR plus 55 basis points, based on the Company's current credit ratings. The Company's existing $1.0 billion credit facility will remain, increasing the total unsecured revolving commitments to the Company to $2.5 billion. Vornado is the guarantor of the Company's obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement.
The co-lead arrangers and joint book-runners for the new facility are JP Morgan Securities Inc. and Bank of America Securities, L.L.C. JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. serves as Administrative Agent. Bank of America, N.A. serves as Syndication Agent. Citicorp North America, Inc., Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas and UBS Loan Finance LLC serve as Documentation Agents.
The existing $1.0 billion credit facility's financial covenants have been modified to conform to the new Revolving Credit Agreement financial covenants. Under the terms of the new Revolving Credit Agreement, "Equity Value" may not be less than Three Billion Dollars ($3,000,000,000); "Total Outstanding Indebtedness" may not exceed sixty percent (60%) of "Capitalization Value," which is based on a 6.5% capitalization rate; the ratio of "Combined EBITDA" to "Fixed Charges," each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not be less than 1.40 to 1.00; the ratio of "Unencumbered Combined EBITDA" to "Unsecured Interest Expense," each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not be less than 1.50 to 1.00; at any time, "Unsecured Indebtedness" may not exceed sixty percent (60%) of "Capitalization Value of Unencumbered Assets;" and the ratio of "Secured Indebtedness" to "Capitalization Value," each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not exceed fifty percent (50%). The Revolving Credit Agreement also contains standard representations and warranties and other covenants. The terms in quotations in this paragraph are all defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement.
 
The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of the Revolving Credit Agreement attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Certain statements contained in or made during the presentation may constitute forward-looking statements as such term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The companies' future results, financial condition and business may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.  You can find many of these statements by looking for words such as "approximates," "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "would," "may" or similar expressions.  These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties.  Many of the factors that will determine these items are beyond our ability to control or predict.  Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those set forth in the Company's and Vornado's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 under "Forward Looking Statements" and "Item 1A. Risk Factors." For these statements, the Company and Vornado claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company and Vornado expressly disclaim any responsibility to update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on forward-looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends.

(h)       Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each Bank shall be required to fund its Pro Rata Share of the Available Total Loan Commitment in accordance with Section 2.01(b) despite the fact that any Bank's Loan Commitment may have been or may be exceeded as a result of such Bank's making Bid Rate Loans.
(i)        A Bank who is notified that it has been selected to make a Bid Rate Loan as provided above may designate its Designated Lender (if any) to fund such Bid Rate Loan on its behalf, as described in Section 12.16. Any Designated Lender which funds a Bid Rate Loan shall on and after the time of such funding become the obligee under such Bid Rate Loan and be entitled to receive payment thereof when due. No Bank shall be relieved of its obligation to fund a Bid Rate Loan, and no Designated Lender shall assume such obligation, prior to the time the applicable Bid Rate Loan is funded.
(a)       
Swingline Commitment
. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 2.03, Swingline Lender, in its individual capacity, agrees to make certain revolving credit loans in Dollars to Borrower (each a "
Swingline Loan
" and, collectively, the "
Swingline Loans
") from time to time during the term hereof; provided, however, that the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans outstanding at any time shall not exceed the lesser of (i) One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000), and (ii) the Total Loan Commitment less the sum of (A) all Loans then outstanding, excluding Swingline Loans, and (B) the outstanding amount of all Letters of Credit (the "
Swingline Commitment
"). Subject to the limitations set forth herein, any amounts repaid in respect of Swingline Loans may be reborrowed.
(1)       
Notice of Borrowing
. With respect to any Swingline Loan, Borrower shall give Swingline Lender and Administrative Agent notice in writing which is received by Swingline Lender and Administrative Agent not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the proposed date of such Swingline Loan (and confirmed by telephone by such time), specifying (A) that a Swingline Loan is being requested, (B) the amount of such Swingline Loan, (C) the proposed date of such Swingline Loan, which shall be a Banking Day and (D) stating that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing both before and after giving effect to such Swingline Loan. Such notice shall be irrevocable.
(2)       
Minimum Amounts
. Each Swingline Loan shall be at least Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) and, or an integral multiple of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000).
(3)       
Repayment of Swingline Loans
. Each Swingline Loan shall be due and payable on the earliest of (A) five (5) Banking Days from and including the date of such Swingline Loan, (B) the last calendar day of the month in which such Swingline Loan is
 
21
 
made or (C) the Maturity Date. If, and to the extent, any Swingline Loans shall be due and payable on the date of any Ratable Loan, such Swingline Loans shall first be repaid from the proceeds of such Ratable Loan prior to the disbursement of the same to Borrower. If, and to the extent, a Ratable Loan is not requested prior to the earliest of the Maturity Date, the last calendar day of the month in which such Swingline Loan is made, or the end of the five (5) Banking Day period after such Swingline Loan was made, or unless Borrower shall have notified Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender prior to 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third (3rd) Banking Day after such Swingline Loan was made that Borrower intends to reimburse Swingline Lender for the amount of such Swingline Loan with funds other than proceeds of the Ratable Loans, Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Ratable Loan comprised entirely of Base Rate Loans in the amount of the applicable Swingline Loan then outstanding, the proceeds of which shall be used to repay such Swingline Loan to Swingline Lender. In addition, if (x) Borrower does not repay a Swingline Loan on or prior to the end of such five (5) Banking Day period, or (y) a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred during such five (5) Banking Day period, Swingline Lender may, at any time, in its sole discretion, by written notice to the Borrower and Administrative Agent, demand repayment of its Swingline Loans by way of a Ratable Loan, in which case the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Ratable Loan comprised entirely of Base Rate Loans in the amount of such Swingline Loans then outstanding, the proceeds of which shall be used to repay such Swingline Loans to Swingline Lender. Any Ratable Loan which is deemed requested by the Borrower in accordance with this Section 2.03(b)(3) is hereinafter referred to as a "
Mandatory Borrowing
". Each Bank hereby irrevocably agrees to make Ratable Loans promptly upon receipt of notice from Swingline Lender of any such deemed request for a Mandatory Borrowing in the amount and in the manner specified in the preceding sentences and on the date such notice is received by such Bank (or the next Banking Day if such notice is received after 12:00 p.m. (New York City time)) notwithstanding (I) the amount of the Mandatory Borrowing may not comply with the minimum amount of Ratable Loans otherwise required hereunder, (II) whether any conditions specified in Section 4.02 are then satisfied, (III) whether a Default or an Event of Default then exists, (IV) failure of any such deemed request for a Ratable Loan to be made by the time otherwise required in Section 2.06, (V) the date of such Mandatory Borrowing (provided that such date must be a Banking Day), or (VI) any termination of the Loan Commitments immediately prior to such Mandatory Borrowing or contemporaneously therewith; provided, however, that no Bank shall be obligated to make Ratable Loans in respect of a Mandatory Borrowing if a Default or an Event of Default then exists and the applicable Swingline Loan was made by Swingline Lender without receipt of a written notice of borrowing in the form specified in Section 2.03(b)(1) or after Administrative Agent has delivered a notice of Default or Event of Default which has not been rescinded.
(4)       
Purchase of Participations
. In the event that any Mandatory Borrowing cannot for any reason be made on the date otherwise required above (including, without limitation, as a result of the commencement of a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the Borrower), then each Bank hereby agrees that it shall forthwith purchase (as of the date the Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for any payment received from the Borrower on or after such date and prior to such purchase) from Swingline Lender such participations in the outstanding Swingline
 
22
 
Loans as shall be necessary to cause each such Bank to share in such Swingline Loans ratably based upon its Pro Rata Share (determined before giving effect to any termination of the Loan Commitments), provided that (A) all interest payable on the Swingline Loans with respect to any participation shall be for the account of Swingline Lender until but excluding the day upon which the Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred, and (B) in the event of a delay between the day upon which the Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred and the time any purchase of a participation pursuant to this sentence is actually made, the purchasing Bank shall be required to pay to Swingline Lender interest on the principal amount of such participation for each day from and including the day upon which the Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred to but excluding the date of payment for such participation, at the rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate, for the two (2) Banking Days after the date the Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred, and thereafter at a rate equal to the Base Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Bank shall be obligated to purchase a participation in any Swingline Loan if a Default or an Event of Default then exists and such Swingline Loan was made by Swingline Lender without receipt of a written notice of borrowing in the form specified in Section 2.03(b)(1) or after Administrative Agent has delivered a notice of Default or Event of Default which has not been rescinded.
(c)       
Interest Rate
. Each Swingline Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from the date such Swingline Loan is made until the date it is repaid, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans.
SECTION 2.04.          
Advances, Generally
. The Initial Advance shall be at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) and in an integral multiple of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) and shall be made upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 4.01. Subsequent advances shall be made no more frequently than weekly thereafter, upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. The amount of each advance subsequent to the Initial Advance shall, subject to Section 2.13, be at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (unless less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) is available for disbursement pursuant to the terms hereof at the time of any subsequent advance, in which case the amount of such subsequent advance shall be equal to such remaining availability) and in an integral multiple of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000). Additional restrictions on the amounts and timing of, and conditions to the making of, advances of Bid Rate Loans and Swingline Loans are set forth in Sections 2.02 and 2.03, respectively.
Each advance shall be subject, in addition to the limitations and conditions applicable to advances of the Loans generally, to Administrative Agent's receipt, on or immediately prior to the date the request for such advance is made, of a certificate from the officer requesting the advance certifying that Borrower is in compliance with all covenants enumerated in paragraphs 3(a) and 3(b) of Section 6.09 and containing covenant compliance calculations with respect to Sections 8.02 and 8.06 only, that include the proforma adjustments described below, which calculations shall demonstrate Borrower's compliance with covenants on a proforma basis.
 
23
 
In connection with each advance of Loan proceeds, the following proforma adjustments shall be made to the covenant compliance calculations required with respect to Sections 8.02 and 8.06 as of the end of the most recently ended calendar quarter for which financial results are required hereunder to have been reported by Borrower:
(i)              Total Outstanding Indebtedness and Unsecured Indebtedness shall be adjusted by adding thereto, respectively, all Indebtedness and Unsecured Indebtedness, respectively, that is incurred by Borrower in connection with such advance;
(ii)             Capitalization Value, shall be adjusted by adding thereto the purchase price of any Real Property Assets (including capitalized acquisition costs determined in accordance with GAAP) or the Net Equity Value of any Other Investments, together with the Borrower's Pro Rata Share of any unrestricted cash or cash equivalents, the book value of notes and mortgage loans receivable and marketable securities and the cost of non-marketable securities that are acquired in connection with such advance; and
(iii)            Capitalization Value of Unencumbered Assets shall be adjusted by adding thereto the purchase price of any Real Property Assets (including capitalized acquisition costs determined in accordance with GAAP) that are Unencumbered Assets together with Borrower's Pro Rata Share of any unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and the book value of notes and mortgage loans receivable and marketable securities and the cost of non-marketable securities that are acquired in connection with such advance.
SECTION 2.05.          
Procedures for Advances
. In the case of advances of Ratable Loans, Borrower shall submit to Administrative Agent a request for each advance, stating the amount requested and the expected purpose for which such advance is to be used, no later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the date, in the case of advances of Base Rate Loans, which is one (1) Banking Day, and, in the case of advances of LIBOR Loans, which is three (3) Banking Days, prior to the date such advance is to be made.

The amount so received by Administrative Agent shall, subject to the conditions of this Agreement, be made available to Borrower, in immediately available funds, by Administrative Agent's to an account designated by Borrower.
SECTION 2.06.          
Interest Periods; Renewals
. In the case of the LIBOR Loans, Borrower shall select an Interest Period of any duration in accordance with the definition of Interest Period in Section 1.01, subject to the following limitations: (1) no Interest Period may extend beyond the Maturity Date (as the same may be extended); (2) if an Interest Period would
 
24
 
end on a day which is not a Banking Day, such Interest Period shall be extended to the next Banking Day, unless such Banking Day would fall in the next calendar month, in which event such Interest Period shall end on the immediately preceding Banking Day; and (3) only eight (8) discrete segments of a Bank's Ratable Loan bearing interest at a LIBOR Interest Rate for a designated Interest Period pursuant to a particular Election, Conversion or Continuation may be outstanding at any one time (each such segment of each Bank's Ratable Loan corresponding to a proportionate segment of each of the other Banks' Ratable Loans).
Upon notice to Administrative Agent as provided in Section 2.14, Borrower may Continue any LIBOR Loan on the last day of the Interest Period of the same or different duration in accordance with the limitations provided above.
SECTION 2.07.          
Interest
. Borrower shall pay interest to Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Bank on the outstanding and unpaid principal amount of the Loans, at a rate per annum as follows: (1) for Base Rate Loans at a rate equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin; (2) for LIBOR Loans at a rate equal to the applicable LIBOR Interest Rate plus the Applicable Margin; and (3) for Bid Rate Loans at a rate equal to the applicable LIBOR Bid Rate. Any principal amount not paid when due (when scheduled, at acceleration or otherwise) shall bear interest thereafter, payable on demand, at the Default Rate.
The interest rate on Base Rate Loans shall change when the Base Rate changes. Interest on Base Rate Loans, LIBOR Loans and Bid Rate Loans shall not exceed the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. Interest shall be calculated for the actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a year consisting of three hundred sixty (360) days.
Accrued interest shall be due and payable in arrears, (x) in the case of both Base Rate Loans and LIBOR Loans, on the first Banking Day of each calendar month and (y) in the case of Bid Rate Loans, at the expiration of the Interest Period applicable thereto, but no less frequently than once every three (3) months determined on the basis of the first (1) day of the Interest Period applicable to the Loan in question;
st
provided
,
however
, that interest accruing at the Default Rate shall be due and payable on demand.
SECTION 2.08.          
Fees
. Borrower shall, during the term of this Agreement commencing as of the Closing Date, pay to Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank a facility fee computed, on the daily Loan Commitment of such Bank, by multiplying the aggregate Loan Commitments on such day by an amount equal to the daily
Facility Fee calculated on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty (360) days for the actual number of days elapsed. The accrued facility fee shall be due and payable in arrears on the first Banking Day of January, April, July and October of each year, commencing on the first such date after the Closing Date, and upon the Maturity Date (as the case may be accelerated) or earlier termination of the Loan Commitments.
SECTION 2.09.          
Notes
. The Loans made by each Bank under this Agreement shall be evidenced by a single note, in the form of EXHIBIT B, duly executed by Borrower, payable to such Bank for the account of its Applicable Lending Office (each such note, as the same may hereafter be amended, modified, extended, severed, assigned, substituted,
 
25
 
renewed or restated from time to time, including any substitute note pursuant to Section 3.07 or 12.05, a "
Note
" and collectively, the "
Notes
").
Each Bank is hereby authorized by Borrower to endorse on the schedule attached to the Note held by it, the amount of each advance, and each payment of principal received by such Bank for the account of its Applicable Lending Office(s) on account of its Loans, which endorsement shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive as to the outstanding balance of the Loans made by such Bank. The failure by Administrative Agent or any Bank to make such notations with respect to the Loans or each advance or payment shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of Borrower under this Agreement or the Notes.
Each Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, request that its Loans of a particular type (including, without limitation, Swingline Loans and Bid Rate Loans) be evidenced by a separate Note in an amount equal to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Loans. Any additional costs incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Borrower or the Banks in connection with preparing such a Note shall be at the sole cost and expense of the Bank requesting such Note. In the event any Loans evidenced by such a Note are paid in full prior to the Maturity Date, any such Bank shall return such Note to Borrower. Each such Note shall be in substantially the form of EXHIBIT B hereto with appropriate modifications to reflect the fact that it evidences solely Loans of the relevant type. Upon the execution and delivery of any such Note, any existing Note payable to such Bank shall be replaced or modified accordingly. Each reference in this Agreement to the "Note" of such Bank shall be deemed to refer to and include any or all of such Notes, as the context may require.
In connection with a Refinancing Mortgage, Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, a mortgage note, payable to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks, which shall be secured by the applicable Refinancing Mortgage. Such note shall be in such form as shall be requested by Borrower, subject to the Administrative Agent's reasonable approval. Each reference in this Agreement to the "Notes" shall be deemed to refer to and include any or all of such mortgage notes, as the context may require.
Without prepayment premium or penalty but subject to Section 3.05, Borrower may, upon at least one (1) Banking Day's notice to Administrative Agent in the case of the Base Rate Loans, and at least three (3) Banking Days' notice to Administrative Agent in the case of LIBOR Loans, prepay the Ratable Loans in whole or, with respect to Base Rate Loans only, in part, provided that (1) any partial prepayment under this Section shall be in integral multiples of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000); and (2) each prepayment under this Section shall include, at Administrative Agent's option, all interest accrued on the amount of principal prepaid to (but excluding) the date of prepayment. Borrower shall have the right to prepay Bid Rate Loans only with the consent of the Bank or the Designated Lender that funded the Bid Rate Loan that Borrower desires to prepay. Borrower may, from time to time on any Banking Day so long as prior notice is given to Administrative Agent and Swingline Lender no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the day on which Borrower intends to make such prepayment, prepay any Swingline Loans in whole or in part in amounts aggregating at least One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), and in an integral multiple of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000)
 
26
 
(or, if less, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Swingline Loans then outstanding) by paying the principal amount to be prepaid together with accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment by initiating a wire transfer of the principal and interest on the Swingline Loans no later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on such day and Borrower shall deliver a federal reference number evidencing such wire transfer to Administrative Agent as soon as available thereafter on such day. Unless otherwise directed by Borrower, any prepayments made by the Borrower shall be applied first to any and all Loans outstanding that are not secured by a Refinancing Mortgage, and only to Loans secured by Refinancing Mortgages if there shall be no other Loans outstanding at the time.
Borrower shall make each payment under this Agreement and under the Notes not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date when due in Dollars to Administrative Agent at Administrative Agent's Office in immediately available funds. Borrower shall deliver federal reference number(s) evidencing the applicable wire transfer(s) to Administrative Agent as soon as available thereafter on such day. Administrative Agent will thereafter, on the day of its receipt of each such payment(s), cause to be distributed to each Bank (1) such Bank's appropriate share (based upon the respective outstanding principal amounts and interest due under the Notes of the Banks) of the payments of principal and interest in like funds for the account of such Bank's Applicable Lending Office; and (2) fees payable to such Bank in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If and to the extent that the Administrative Agent shall receive any such payment for the account of the Banks on or before 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on any Business Day, and Administrative Agent shall not have distributed to any Bank its applicable share of such payment on such day, Administrative Agent shall distribute such amount to such Bank together with interest thereon paid by the Administrative Agent, for each day from the date such amount should have been distributed to such Bank until the date Administrative Agent distributes such amount to such Bank, at the Prime Rate.
Except to the extent provided in this Agreement, whenever any payment to be made under this Agreement or under the Notes is due on any day other than a Banking Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Banking Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of the payment of interest and other fees, as the case may be.
Subject to the provisions of Article III and Sections 2.06 and 2.13, Borrower shall have the right to Elect to have all or a portion of any advance of the Ratable Loans be LIBOR Loans, to Convert Base Rate Loans into LIBOR Loans, to Convert LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans, or to Continue LIBOR Loans as LIBOR Loans, at any time or from time to time, provided that: (1) Borrower shall give Administrative Agent notice of each such Election, Conversion or Continuation as provided in Section 2.14; and (2) a LIBOR Loan may be Continued or Converted only on the last day of the applicable Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Election, Continuation and Conversion shall be applicable to each Bank's Ratable Loan in accordance with its Pro Rata Share.
 
27
 
With respect to the Ratable Loans as a whole, each Election and each Conversion shall be in an amount at least equal to One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) and in integral multiples of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) or such lesser amount as shall be available.
SECTION 2.14.          
Certain Notices Regarding Elections, Conversions and Continuations of Loans
.
 
Promptly following its receipt of any such notice, Administrative Agent shall so advise the Banks by facsimile. Each such notice of Election shall specify the portion of the amount of the advance that is to be LIBOR Loans (subject to Section 2.13) and the duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto (subject to Section 2.06); each such notice of Conversion shall specify the LIBOR Loans or Base Rate Loans to be Converted; and each such notice of Conversion or Continuation shall specify the date of Conversion or Continuation (which shall be a Banking Day), the amount thereof (subject to Section 2.13) and the duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto (subject to Section 2.06). In the event that Borrower fails to Elect to have any portion of an advance of the Ratable Loans be LIBOR Loans, the portion of such advance for which a LIBOR Loan Election is not made shall constitute Base Rate Loans. In the event that Borrower fails to Continue any portion of an advance of LIBOR Loans within the time period and as otherwise provided in this Section, such LIBOR Loans will be automatically Converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day of the then current applicable Interest Period for such LIBOR Loans.
SECTION 2.16.          
Changes of Loan Commitments
.(a)  At any time, Borrower shall have the right, without premium or penalty, to terminate any unused Loan Commitments existing as of the date of such termination, in whole or in part, from time to time, provided that: (1) Borrower shall give notice of each such termination to Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify each of the Banks) no later than 10:00 a.m. (New York time) on the date which is three (3) Banking Days prior to the effectiveness of such termination; (2) the Loan Commitments of each of the Banks must be terminated (and in the case of a partial termination, on a pro rata basis) (taking into account, however, Section 2.02(h)) and simultaneously with those of the other Banks; and (3) each partial termination of the Loan Commitments in the aggregate (and corresponding reduction of the Total Loan Commitment) shall be in an integral multiple of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000). A reduction of the unused Loan Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.16 shall not effect a reduction in the Swingline Commitment (unless so
 
28
 
elected by the Borrower) until the aggregate unused Loan Commitments have been reduced to an amount equal to or less than the Swingline Commitment.
(b)        The Loan Commitments and the Swingline Commitment, to the extent terminated, may not be reinstated.
(c)       Unless a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower, by written notice to Administrative Agent, may request on up to four (4) occasions during the term of this Agreement that the Total Loan Commitment be increased by an amount not less than Twenty Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) per request and not more than Four Hundred Ninety Million Dollars ($490,000,000) in the aggregate (provided, however, that such amount may be increased, dollar for dollar, by the amount of any Affected Bank's Loan Commitment that Borrower shall terminate in accordance with Section 3.07) (such that the Total Loan Commitment after such increases shall never exceed Two Billion Dollars ($2,000,000,000));
provided
that for any such request (a) the Borrower shall not have delivered an Extension Notice prior to, or simultaneously with, such request, (b) any Bank which is a party to this Agreement prior to such request for increase, at its sole discretion, may elect to increase its Loan Commitment but shall not have any obligation to so increase its Loan Commitment, and (c) in the event that each Bank does not elect to increase its Loan Commitment, the Lead Arrangers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to locate additional Qualified Institutions willing to hold commitments for the requested increase, and Borrower may also identify additional Qualified Institutions willing to hold commitments for the requested increase;
provided
however
that Administrative Agent shall have the right to approve any such additional Qualified Institutions, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event that Qualified Institutions commit to any such increase, the Total Loan Commitment and the Loan Commitments of the committed Banks shall be increased, the Pro Rata Shares of the Lenders shall be adjusted, new Notes shall be issued, Borrower shall make such borrowings and repayments as shall be necessary to effect the reallocation of the Ratable Loans so that the Ratable Loans are held by the Banks in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares after giving effect to such increase, and other changes shall be made to the Loan Documents as may be necessary to reflect the aggregate amount, if any, by which Banks have agreed to increase their respective Loan Commitments or make new Loan Commitments in response to the Borrower's request for an increase in the Total Loan Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.16(c), in each case without the consent of the Banks other than those Banks increasing their Loan Commitments. The fees payable by Borrower upon any such increase in the Total Loan Commitment shall be agreed upon by the Lead Arranger and Borrower at the time of such increase.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 2.16(c) shall constitute or be deemed to constitute an agreement by any Bank to increase its Loan Commitment hereunder.
(a)       Borrower, by notice to Administrative Agent and the Fronting Bank, may request, in lieu of advances of proceeds of the Ratable Loans, that the Fronting Bank issue unconditional, irrevocable standby letters of credit (each, a "
Letter of Credit
") for the account of Borrower or its designee (which shall be an Affiliate of Borrower) (it being understood that the issuance of a Letter of Credit for the account of a designee shall not in any way relieve Borrower
 
29
 
of any of its obligations hereunder), payable by sight drafts, for such beneficiaries and with such other terms as Borrower shall specify. Unless the Fronting Bank has received written notice from the Administrative Agent, Borrower or any Bank, not less than one (1) Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Section 4.02 shall not have been satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Fronting Bank, on the requested date, shall issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the Fronting Bank's usual and customary business practices. Promptly upon issuance of a Letter of Credit, the Fronting Bank shall notify Administrative Agent and Administrative Agent shall notify each of the Banks by telephone or by facsimile.
(b)       The amount of any such Letter of Credit shall be limited to the lesser of (1) Six Hundred Million Dollars ($600,000,000) less the aggregate face amount of all other Letters of Credit then issued and outstanding or (2) the Available Total Loan Commitment, it being understood that the amount of each Letter of Credit issued and outstanding shall effect a reduction, by an equal amount, of the Available Total Loan Commitment as provided in Section 2.01(b) (such reduction to be allocated to each Bank's Loan Commitment ratably in accordance with the Banks' respective Pro Rata Shares).
(c)       Subject to Section 2.17(e), the amount of each Letter of Credit shall be further subject to the conditions and limitations applicable to amounts of advances set forth in Section 2.04 and the procedures for the issuance of each Letter of Credit shall be the same as the procedures applicable to the making of advances as set forth in the first sentence of Section 2.05.
(d)       The Fronting Bank's issuance of each Letter of Credit shall be subject to Borrower's satisfaction of all conditions precedent to its entitlement to an advance of proceeds of the Loans.
(e)       Each Letter of Credit shall (i) unless approved by the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Bank, expire no later than the earlier of (x) fourteen (14) days prior to the Maturity Date or (y), one (1) year after the date of its issuance (without regard to any automatic renewal provisions thereof), and (ii) be in a minimum amount of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), or such lesser amount approved by the Fronting Bank. In no event shall a Letter of Credit expire later than the first anniversary of the Maturity Date(without regard to any automatic renewal provisions thereof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, with the approval of the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Bank, any Letters of Credit are issued and outstanding on the date that is fourteen (14) days prior to the Maturity Date (or are issued on any day thereafter prior to the Maturity Date), Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent on such date by wire transfer of immediately available funds a cash deposit in the amount of such Letters of Credit in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.17(i). Such funds shall be held by Administrative Agent in an interest bearing account and applied to repay the drawings in the event of any drawing under such Letters of Credit on or after the Maturity Date. Such funds, with any interest earned thereon, will be returned to Borrower (and may be returned from time to time with respect to any applicable Letter of Credit) on the earlier of (a) the date that the applicable Letter of Credit or Letters of Credit expire in accordance with their terms; and (b) the date that the applicable Letter of Credit or Letters of Credit are cancelled.

(f)        In connection with, and as a further condition to the issuance of, each Letter of Credit, Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Fronting Bank an application for the Letter of Credit in such form, and together with such other documents, opinions and assurances, as the Fronting Bank shall reasonably require.
(g)       In connection with each Letter of Credit, Borrower hereby covenants to pay (i) to Administrative Agent, quarterly in arrears (on the first Banking Day of each calendar quarter following the issuance of such Letter of Credit), a fee, payable to Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks, computed daily on the face amount of such Letter of Credit issued and outstanding at a rate per annum equal to the "Banks' L/C Fee Rate" (as hereinafter defined) and (ii) to the Fronting Bank, payable quarterly in arrears, a fee, payable to the Fronting Bank for its own account, computed daily on the amount of such Letter of Credit issued and outstanding at a rate per annum equal to 0.0125%. Administrative Agent shall have no responsibility for the collection of the fee for any Letter of Credit that is payable to the Fronting Bank. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Banks' L/C Fee Rate" shall mean, provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin for LIBOR Loans and, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, a rate per annum equal to 3%. It is understood and agreed that the last installment of the fees provided for in this paragraph (g) with respect to any particular Letter of Credit shall be due and payable on the first day of the calendar quarter following the return or cancellation, of such Letter of Credit.
(h)       The Fronting Bank shall promptly notify Administrative Agent of any drawing under a Letter of Credit issued by such Fronting Bank. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, promptly upon notice from Administrative Agent of any drawing under a Letter of Credit, each Bank shall, notwithstanding the existence of a Default or Event of Default or the non-satisfaction of any conditions precedent to the making of an advance of the Loans, advance proceeds of its Ratable Loan, in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of such drawing, which advance shall be made to Administrative Agent for disbursement to the Fronting Bank issuing such Letter of Credit to reimburse the Fronting Bank, for its own account, for such drawing. Each of the Banks further acknowledges that its obligation to fund its Pro Rata Share of drawings under Letters of Credit as aforesaid shall survive the termination of the Commitments or enforcement of remedies hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. If any Ratable Loan cannot for any reason be made on the date otherwise required above (including, without limitation, as a result of the commencement of a proceeding under any applicable bankruptcy law with respect to Borrower), then each of the Banks shall purchase (on the date such Ratable Loan would otherwise have been made) from the Fronting Bank a participation interest in any unreimbursed drawing in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of such unreimbursed drawing.
(i)        Borrower agrees, upon and during the occurrence of an Event of Default and at the request of Administrative Agent, (x) to deposit with Administrative Agent cash collateral in the amount of all the outstanding Letters of Credit, which cash collateral is hereby pledged and shall be held by Administrative Agent in an account as security for Borrower's obligations in connection with the Letters of Credit and (y) to execute and deliver to Administrative Agent such documents as Administrative Agent requests to confirm and perfect the assignment of such cash collateral and such account to Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Banks. Any such cash collateral deposited with Administrative Agent (together with any
 
31
 
interest thereon) shall be returned immediately to Borrower upon the cure of such Event of Default.
SECTION 2.18.          
Extension Option
. Borrower may extend the Maturity Date two times only for two (2) periods of one (1) year each upon the following terms and conditions: (i) delivery by Borrower of a written notice to Administrative Agent (the "
Extension Notice
") on or before a date that is not more than one hundred twenty (120) days nor less than one (1) month prior to the then applicable Maturity Date, which Extension Notice Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver to the Banks, which Extension Notice shall include a certification dated as of the date of the Extension Notice signed by a duly authorized signatory of Borrower, stating, to the best of the certifying party's knowledge, (x) all representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and in each of the other Loan Documents are true and correct on and as of the date of the Extension Notice (except in those cases where such representation or warranty expressly relates to an earlier date), and (y) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing both on the date Borrower delivers the Extension Notice and on the original Maturity Date or on the Maturity Date as so extended, in the case of the second Extension Notice (in either case, the "
Extension Date
"), and (iii) Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent on or before (x) the first Extension Date a fee equal to 0.075% of the Total Loan Commitment on the first Extension Date, and (y) the second Extension Date a fee equal to 0.10% of the Total Loan Commitment on the second Extension Date, which fees shall be distributed by Administrative Agent pro rata to each of the Banks based on each Bank's Pro Rata Share. Borrower's delivery of the Extension Notices shall be irrevocable.

YIELD PROTECTION; ILLEGALITY; ETC.
SECTION 3.01.          
Additional Costs
. Borrower shall pay directly to each Bank from time to time on demand such amounts as such Bank may reasonably determine to be necessary to compensate it for any increased costs which such Bank determines are attributable to its making or maintaining a LIBOR Loan or a Bid Rate Loan, or its obligation to make or maintain a LIBOR Loan or a Bid Rate Loan, or its obligation to Convert a Base Rate Loan to a LIBOR Loan hereunder, or any reduction in any amount receivable by such Bank hereunder in respect of its LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan(s) or such obligations (such increases in costs and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called "
Additional Costs
"), in each case resulting from any Regulatory Change which:
(1)       changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to such Bank under this Agreement or the Notes in respect of any such LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan (other than (i) changes in the rate of general corporate, franchise, branch profit, net income or other income tax imposed on such Bank or its Applicable Lending Office or (ii) a tax described in Section 10.13); or
(2)       (other than to the extent the LIBOR Reserve Requirement is taken into account in determining the LIBOR Rate at the commencement of the applicable Interest Period) imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit, deposit insurance or
 
32
 
assessment, minimum capital, capital ratio or similar requirements relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities of, such Bank (including any LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan or any deposits referred to in the definition of "LIBOR Interest Rate" in Section 1.01), or any commitment of such Bank (including such Bank's Loan Commitment hereunder); or
(3)       imposes any other condition (unrelated to the basis of taxation referred to in paragraph (1) above) affecting this Agreement or the Notes (or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities).
Without limiting the effect of the provisions of the first paragraph of this Section, in the event that, by reason of any Regulatory Change, any Bank either (1) incurs Additional Costs based on or measured by the excess above a specified level of the amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities of such Bank which includes deposits by reference to which the LIBOR Interest Rate is determined as provided in this Agreement or a category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Bank which includes loans based on the LIBOR Interest Rate or (2) becomes subject to restrictions on the amount of such a category of liabilities or assets which it may hold, then, if such Bank so elects by notice to Borrower (with a copy to Administrative Agent), the obligation of such Bank to permit Elections of, to Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended (in which case the provisions of Section 3.04 shall be applicable) until such Regulatory Change ceases to be in effect.
The obligations of Borrower under this Section shall survive the repayment of all amounts due under or in connection with any of the Loan Documents and the termination of the Loan Commitments in respect of the period prior to such termination.
Determinations and allocations by a Bank for purposes of this Section of the effect of any Regulatory Change pursuant to the first or second paragraph of this Section, on its costs or rate of return of making or maintaining its Loan or portions thereof or on amounts receivable by it in respect of its Loan or portions thereof, and the amounts required to compensate such Bank under this Section, shall be included in a calculation of such amounts given to Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
SECTION 3.02.          
Limitation on Types of Loans
. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determination of the LIBOR Interest Rate for any Interest Period:
(1)       Administrative Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive) that quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits referred to in the definition of "LIBOR Interest Rate" in Section 1.01 are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of determining rates of interest for the LIBOR Loans or Bid Rate Loans as provided in this Agreement; or
(2)       a Bank reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive) and promptly notifies Administrative Agent that the relevant rates of interest referred to in the definition of "LIBOR Interest Rate" in Section 1.01 upon the basis of which the rate of interest for LIBOR Loans or Bid Rate Loans for such Interest Period is to be
 
33
 
determined do not adequately cover the cost to such Bank of making or maintaining such LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan for such Interest Period;
then Administrative Agent shall give Borrower prompt notice thereof, and so long as such condition remains in effect, the Banks (or, in the case of the circumstances described in clause (2) above, the affected Bank) shall be under no obligation to permit Elections of LIBOR Loans, to Convert Base Rate Loans into LIBOR Loans or to Continue LIBOR Loans and Borrower shall, on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for the affected outstanding LIBOR Loans or Bid Rate Loans, either (x) prepay the affected LIBOR Loans or Bid Rate Loans pursuant to Section 3.07 or (y) Convert the affected LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans in accordance with Section 2.12 or convert the rate of interest under the affected Bid Rate Loans to the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans by following the same procedures as are applicable for Conversions into Base Rate Loans set forth in Section 2.12.
SECTION 3.03.          
Illegality
. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Bank or its Applicable Lending Office to honor its obligation to make or maintain a LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan hereunder, to allow Elections or Continuations of a LIBOR Loan or to Convert a Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan, then such Bank shall promptly notify Administrative Agent and Borrower thereof and such Bank's obligation to make or maintain a LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan, or to permit Elections of, to Continue, or to Convert its Base Rate Loan into, a LIBOR Loan shall be suspended (in which case the provisions of Section 3.04 shall be applicable) until such time as such Bank may again make and maintain a LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan.
SECTION 3.04.          
Treatment of Affected Loans
. If the obligations of any Bank to make or maintain a LIBOR Loan or a Bid Rate Loan, or to permit an Election of a LIBOR Loan, to Continue its LIBOR Loan, or to Convert its Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan, are suspended pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.03 (each LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan so affected being herein called an "Affected Loan"), such Bank's Affected Loan shall be automatically Converted into a Base Rate Loan (or, in the case of an Affected Loan that is a Bid Rate Loan, the interest rate thereon shall be converted to the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans) on the last day of the then current Interest Period for the Affected Loan (or, in the case of a Conversion or conversion resulting from Section 3.01 or 3.03, on such earlier date as such Bank may specify to Borrower).
To the extent that such Bank's Affected Loan has been so Converted (or the interest rate thereon so converted), all payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise be applied to such Bank's Affected Loan shall be applied instead to its Base Rate Loan (or to its Bid Rate Loan bearing interest at the converted rate) and such Bank shall have no obligation to Convert its Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan.
SECTION 3.05.          
Certain Compensation
. Other than in connection with a Conversion of an Affected Loan, Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Bank, upon the request of such Bank through Administrative Agent which request includes a calculation of the amount(s) due, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of such Bank) to compensate it for any loss, cost or expense which such Bank reasonably determines is attributable to:
 
34
 
(1)       any payment or prepayment of a LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan made by such Bank, or any Conversion of a LIBOR Loan (or conversion of the rate of interest on a Bid Rate Loan) made by such Bank, in any such case on a date other than the last day of an applicable Interest Period, whether by reason of acceleration or otherwise;
(2)       any failure by Borrower for any reason to Convert a LIBOR Loan or a Base Rate Loan or to Continue a LIBOR Loan, as the case may be, to be Converted or Continued by such Bank on the date specified therefor in the relevant notice under Section 2.14;
(3)       any failure by Borrower to borrow (or to qualify for a borrowing of) a LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan which would otherwise be made hereunder on the date specified in the relevant Election notice under Section 2.14 or Bid Rate Quote acceptance under Section 2.02(e) given or submitted by Borrower; or
(4)       any failure by Borrower to prepay a LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan on the date specified in a notice of prepayment.
Without limiting the foregoing, such compensation shall include an amount equal to the present value (using as the discount rate an interest rate equal to the rate determined under (2) below) of the excess, if any, of (1) the amount of interest (less the Applicable Margin) which otherwise would have accrued on the principal amount so paid, prepaid, Converted or Continued (or not Converted, Continued or borrowed) for the period from the date of such payment, prepayment, Conversion or Continuation (or failure to Convert, Continue or borrow) to the last day of the then current applicable Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to Convert, Continue or borrow, to the last day of the applicable Interest Period which would have commenced on the date specified therefor in the relevant notice) at the applicable rate of interest for the LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan provided for herein, over (2) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Bank) based upon the interest rate which such Bank would have bid in the London interbank market for Dollar deposits, for amounts comparable to such principal amount and maturities comparable to such period. A determination of any Bank as to the amounts payable pursuant to this Section shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
The obligations of Borrower under this Section shall survive the repayment of all amounts due under or in connection with any of the Loan Documents and the termination of the Loan Commitments in respect of the period prior to such termination.
SECTION 3.06.          
Capital Adequacy
. If any Bank shall have determined that, after the date hereof, the adoption of, or any change in, any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by
 
35
 
such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to Administrative Agent), Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for such reduction. A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis therefor, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The obligations of Borrower under this Section shall survive the repayment of all amounts due under or in connection with any of the Loan Documents and the termination of the Loan Commitments in respect of the period prior to such termination.
SECTION 3.07.          
Substitution of Banks
. If any Bank (an "
Affected Bank
") (i) makes demand upon Borrower for (or if Borrower is otherwise required to pay) Additional Costs pursuant to Section 3.01, (ii) is unable to make or maintain a LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan as a result of a condition described in Section 3.03, or clause (2) of Section 3.02 or (iii) has any increased costs as described in Section 3.06, Borrower may, within ninety (90) days of receipt of such demand or notice (or the occurrence of such other event causing Borrower to be required to pay Additional Costs or causing the condition described in Section 3.03, clause (2) of Section 3.02 or Section 3.06 to be applicable to occur), as the case may be, give written notice (a "
Replacement Notice
") to Administrative Agent and to each Bank of Borrower's intention either (x) to prepay in full the Affected Bank's Note and to terminate the Affected Bank's entire Loan Commitment or (y) to replace the Affected Bank with another financial institution (the "
Replacement Bank
") designated in such Replacement Notice. After its replacement, an Affected Bank shall remain entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.06, 10.13 and 12.04 in respect of the period prior to its replacement.
In the event Borrower opts to give the notice provided for in clause (x) above, and if the Affected Bank shall not agree within thirty (30) days of its receipt thereof to waive the payment of the Additional Costs in question or the effect of the circumstances described in Section 3.03, clause (2) of Section 3.02 or Section 3.06, then, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall exist, Borrower may (notwithstanding the provisions of clause (2) of Section 2.16(a)) terminate the Affected Bank's entire Loan Commitment,
provided
that in connection therewith it pays to the Affected Bank all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the Affected Bank's Note, together with all other amounts, if any, due from Borrower to the Affected Bank, including all amounts properly demanded and unreimbursed under Sections 3.01 and 3.05. After any termination as provided in this paragraph, an Affected Bank shall remain entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.06, 10.13 and 12.04 in respect of the period prior to such termination.
In the event Borrower opts to give the notice provided for in clause (y) above, and if (i) Administrative Agent shall, within thirty (30) days of its receipt of the Replacement Notice, notify Borrower and each Bank in writing that the Replacement Bank is reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent and (ii) the Affected Bank shall not, prior to the end of such thirty (30) day period, agree to waive the payment of the Additional Costs in question or the effect of the circumstances described in Section 3.03, clause (2) of Section 3.02, or Section 3.06 then the Affected Bank shall, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall exist, assign its Note and all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to the Replacement Bank, and the Replacement Bank shall assume all of the Affected Bank's rights and obligations, pursuant to an agreement, substantially in the form of an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, executed by
 
36
 
the Affected Bank and the Replacement Bank. In connection with such assignment and assumption, the Replacement Bank shall pay to the Affected Bank an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount under the Affected Bank's Note plus all interest accrued thereon, plus all other amounts, if any (other than the Additional Costs in question), then due and payable to the Affected Bank;
provided
,
however
, that prior to or simultaneously with any such assignment and assumption, Borrower shall have paid to such Affected Bank all amounts properly demanded and unreimbursed under Sections 3.01 and 3.05. Upon the effective date of such assignment and assumption, the Replacement Bank shall become a Bank Party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank as set forth in such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, and the Affected Bank shall be released from its obligations hereunder, and no further consent or action by any party shall be required. Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this Section, a substitute Note shall be issued to the Replacement Bank by Borrower, in exchange for the return of the Affected Bank's Note. The obligations evidenced by such substitute note shall constitute "Obligations" for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. If the Replacement Bank is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof, it shall, prior to the first date on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for its account, deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent a certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with Section 10.13. Each Replacement Bank shall be deemed to have made the representations contained in, and shall be bound by the provisions of, Section 10.13. After any assignment as provided in this paragraph, an Affected Bank shall remain entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.06, 10.13 and 12.04 in respect of the period prior to such assignment.
Borrower, Administrative Agent and the Banks shall execute such modifications to the Loan Documents as shall be reasonably required in connection with and to effectuate the foregoing.
 
Each Bank agrees that, as promptly as practicable after such Bank has actual knowledge of the occurrence of an event or the existence of a condition that would cause such Bank to become an Affected Bank or that would entitle such Bank to receive payments under Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03 or 3.06, it will, to the extent not inconsistent with any applicable legal or regulatory restrictions, use reasonable efforts (i) to make, issue, fund, or maintain the Loan Commitment of such Bank or the affected Loans of such Bank through another lending office of such Bank, or (ii) take such other measures as such Bank may deem reasonable, if as a result thereof the circumstances that would cause such Bank to be an Affected Bank would cease to exist or the additional amounts that would otherwise be required to be paid to such Bank pursuant to Sections 3.01, 3.02 3.03 or 3.06 would be reduced and if, as determined by such Bank in its sole discretion, the making, issuing, funding, or maintaining of such Loan Commitment or Loans through such other lending office or in accordance with such other measures, as the case may be, would not otherwise adversely affect such Loan Commitment or Loans or would not be otherwise disadvantageous to the interests of such Bank.

ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT; RELATIONS AMONG BANKS
SECTION 10.01.        
Appointment, Powers and Immunities of Administrative Agent
. Each Bank hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes Administrative Agent to act as its agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document with such powers as are specifically delegated to Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and any other Loan Document, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Administrative Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and any other Loan Document or required by law, and shall not by reason of this Agreement be a fiduciary or trustee for any Bank except to the extent that Administrative Agent acts as an agent with respect to the receipt or payment of funds (nor shall Administrative Agent have any fiduciary duty to Borrower nor shall any Bank have any fiduciary duty to Borrower or to any other Bank). Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to the Banks for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by Borrower or any officer, partner or official of Borrower or any other Person contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or in any certificate or other document or instrument referred to or provided for in, or received by any of them under, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for the value, legality, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or therein, for the perfection or priority of any Lien securing the Obligations or for any failure by Borrower to perform any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder. Administrative Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized agents, for the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. Neither Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable or responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Borrower shall pay any fee agreed to by Borrower and Administrative Agent with respect to Administrative Agent's services hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Administrative Agent agrees with the Banks that Administrative Agent shall perform its obligations under this Agreement in good faith according to the same standard of care as that customarily exercised by it in administering its own revolving credit loans.
SECTION 10.02.        
Reliance by Administrative Agent
. Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any certification, notice or other communication (including any thereof by telephone, telex, telegram or cable) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent may deem and treat each Bank as the holder of the Loan made by it for all purposes hereof and shall not be required to deal with any Person who has acquired a participation in any Loan or participation from a Bank. As to any matters not
 
54
 
expressly provided for by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder in accordance with instructions signed by the Required Banks, and such instructions of the Required Banks and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Banks and any other holder of all or any portion of any Loan or participation.
SECTION 10.03.        
Defaults
. Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default (other than an Event of Default pursuant to Section 9.01(1)) unless Administrative Agent has received notice from a Bank or Borrower specifying such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default." In the event that Administrative Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default, Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Banks. Administrative Agent, following consultation with the Banks, shall (subject to Section 10.07 and Section 12.02) take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default which is continuing as shall be directed by the Required Banks;
provided
that, unless and until Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, Administrative Agent may take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interest of the Banks; and
provided
further
that Administrative Agent shall not send a notice of Default, Event of Default or acceleration to Borrower without the approval of the Required Banks. In no event shall Administrative Agent be required to take any such action which it determines to be contrary to law.
SECTION 10.04.        
Rights of Agent as a Bank
. With respect to its Loan Commitment and the Loan provided by it, each Person serving as an Agent in its capacity as a Bank hereunder shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not acting as such Agent, and the term any "Bank" or "Banks" shall include each Person serving as an Agent in its capacity as a Bank. Each Person serving as an Agent and its Affiliates may (without having to account therefor to any Bank) accept deposits from, lend money to (on a secured or unsecured basis), and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with, Borrower (and any Affiliates of Borrower) as if it were not acting as such Agent.
SECTION 10.05.        
Indemnification of Agents
. Each Bank agrees to indemnify each Agent (to the extent not reimbursed under Section 12.04 or under the applicable provisions of any other Loan Document, but without limiting the obligations of Borrower under Section 12.04 or such provisions), for its Pro Rata Share of any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other documents contemplated by or referred to herein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including, without limitation, the costs and expenses which Borrower is obligated to pay under Section 12.04) or under the applicable provisions of any other Loan Document or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or thereof or of any such other documents or instruments; provided that no Bank shall be liable for (1) any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party to be indemnified, (2) any loss of principal or interest with respect to the Loan of any Person serving as an Agent or (3) any loss suffered by
 
55
 
such Agent in connection with a swap or other interest rate hedging arrangement entered into with Borrower.
SECTION 10.06.        
Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Banks
. Each Bank agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on any Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of Borrower and the decision to enter into this Agreement and that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document. Each Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by Borrower of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or to inspect the properties or books of Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by any Agent hereunder, each Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of Borrower (or any Affiliate of Borrower) which may come into the possession of such Agent or any of its Affiliates. Each Agent shall not be required to file this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any document or instrument referred to herein or therein for record, or give notice of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any document or instrument referred to herein or therein, to anyone.
SECTION 10.07.        
Failure of Administrative Agent to Act
. Except for action expressly required of Administrative Agent hereunder, Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder unless it shall have received further assurances (which may include cash collateral) of the indemnification obligations of the Banks under Section 10.05 in respect of any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.
SECTION 10.08.        
Resignation or Removal of Administrative Agent
. Administrative Agent shall have the right to resign at any time. Administrative Agent may be removed at any time with cause by the Required Banks,
provided
that Borrower and the other Banks shall be promptly notified in writing thereof. Upon any such removal or resignation, the Required Banks shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent which successor Administrative Agent, so long as it is reasonably acceptable both to the Required Banks and, provided that no Default or Event of Default shall then have occurred and be continuing, the Borrower, shall be that Bank then having the greatest Loan Commitment. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the Required Banks' removal of the retiring Administrative Agent, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be one of the Banks. The Required Banks or the retiring Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall upon the appointment of a successor Administrative Agent promptly so notify in writing Borrower and the other Banks. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties
 
56
 
and obligations hereunder. The rights and duties of Administrative Agent to be vested in any successor Administrative Agent shall include, without limitation, the rights and duties as Swingline Lender. After any retiring Administrative Agent's removal hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
SECTION 10.09.        
Amendments Concerning Agency Function
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Administrative Agent shall not be bound by any waiver, amendment, supplement or modification of this Agreement or any other Loan Document which affects its duties, rights, and/or function hereunder or thereunder unless it shall have given its prior written consent thereto.
SECTION 10.10.        
Liability of Administrative Agent
. Administrative Agent shall not have any liabilities or responsibilities to Borrower on account of the failure of any Bank to perform its obligations hereunder or to any Bank on account of the failure of Borrower to perform its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document.
SECTION 10.11.        
Transfer of Agency Function
. Without the consent of Borrower or any Bank, Administrative Agent may at any time or from time to time transfer its functions as Administrative Agent hereunder to any of its offices wherever located in the United States,
provided
that Administrative Agent shall promptly notify in writing Borrower and the Banks thereof.
SECTION 10.12.        
Non-Receipt of Funds by Administrative Agent
. Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Bank or Borrower (either one as appropriate being the "
Payor
") prior to the date on which such Bank is to make payment hereunder to Administrative Agent of the proceeds of a Loan or Borrower is to make payment to Administrative Agent, as the case may be (either such payment being a "
Required Payment
"), which notice shall be effective upon receipt, that the Payor will not make the Required Payment in full to Administrative Agent, Administrative Agent may assume that the Required Payment has been made in full to Administrative Agent on such date, and Administrative Agent in its sole discretion may, but shall not be obligated to, in reliance upon such assumption, make the amount thereof available to the intended recipient on such date. If and to the extent the Payor shall not have in fact so made the Required Payment in full to Administrative Agent, the recipient of such payment shall repay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount made available to it together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount was so made available by Administrative Agent until the date Administrative Agent recovers such amount, at the customary rate set by Administrative Agent for the correction of errors among Banks for three (3) Banking Days and thereafter at the Base Rate.
SECTION 10.13.        
Withholding Taxes
. Each Bank represents at all times during the term of this Agreement that it is entitled to receive any payments to be made to it hereunder without the withholding of any tax and will furnish to Administrative Agent and Borrower such forms, certifications, statements and other documents as Administrative Agent or Borrower may request from time to time to evidence such Bank's exemption from the withholding of any tax imposed by any jurisdiction or to enable Administrative Agent or
 
57
 
Borrower to comply with any applicable Laws or regulations relating thereto. Without limiting the effect of the foregoing, if any Bank is not created or organized under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof, such Bank will furnish to Administrative Agent and Borrower Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN of the United States Internal Revenue Service; or such other forms, certifications, statements or documents, duly executed and completed by such Bank as evidence of such Bank's complete exemption from the withholding of United States tax with respect thereto. Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any payments hereunder to such Bank in respect of any Loan or participation or such Bank's Loan Commitment or obligation to purchase participations until such Bank shall have furnished to Administrative Agent and Borrower the requested form, certification, statement or document.
SECTION 10.14.        
Pro Rata Treatment
. Except to the extent otherwise provided, (1) each advance of proceeds of the Ratable Loans shall be made by the Banks, (2) each reduction of the amount of the Total Loan Commitment under Section 2.16 shall be applied to the Loan Commitments of the Banks and (3) each payment of the facility fee accruing under Section 2.08 shall be made for the account of the Banks, ratably according to the amounts of their respective Loan Commitments.
SECTION 10.15.        
Sharing of Payments Among Banks
. If a Bank shall obtain payment of any principal of or interest on any Loan made by it through the exercise of any right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, or by any other means (including direct payment), and such payment results in such Bank receiving a greater payment than it would have been entitled to had such payment been paid directly to Administrative Agent for disbursement to the Banks, then such Bank shall promptly purchase for cash from the other Banks participations in the Loans made by the other Banks in such amounts, and/or make such other adjustments from time to time as shall be equitable to the end that all the Banks shall share ratably the benefit of such payment. To such end the Banks shall make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of participations sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be restored. Borrower agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation in the Loans made by other Banks may exercise all rights of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such participation. Nothing contained herein shall require any Bank to exercise any such right or shall affect the right of any Bank to exercise, and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to any other indebtedness of Borrower.
SECTION 10.16.        
Possession of Documents
. Each Bank shall keep possession of its own Note. Administrative Agent shall hold all the other Loan Documents and related documents in its possession and maintain separate records and accounts with respect thereto, and shall permit the Banks and their representatives access at all reasonable times to inspect such Loan Documents, related documents, records and accounts.
SECTION 10.17.        
Syndication Agents and Documentation Agents
. The Banks serving as Syndication Agents, Documentation Agents, Managing Agents or Co-Agents shall have no duties or obligations in such capacities.

SECTION 11.02.

Relevant Documents
"), no recourse under or upon any Obligation, representation, warranty, promise or other matter whatsoever shall be had against any of the VRT Principals, and each Bank expressly waives and releases, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, all right to assert any liability whatsoever under or with respect to the Relevant Documents against, or to satisfy any claim or obligation arising thereunder against, any of the VRT Principals or out of any assets of the VRT Principals,

59
 
Loans and/or assets of Borrower or General Partner any judgment obtained by Administrative Agent and/or the Banks with respect to, any action or suit under the Relevant Documents so long as no judgment shall be taken or shall be enforced against any of the VRT Principals or their assets.

. Borrower agrees that, by its acceptance of any advance of proceeds of the Loans under this Agreement or the issuance of any Letter of Credit, it shall be bound in all respects by the request for advance or Letter of Credit submitted on its behalf in connection therewith with the same force and effect as if Borrower had itself executed and submitted the request for advance or Letter of Credit and whether or not the request for advance is executed and/or submitted by an authorized person.
SECTION 12.02.        
Amendments and Waivers
. No amendment or material waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document nor consent to any material departure by Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Required Banks and, solely for purposes of its acknowledgment thereof, Administrative Agent, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given,
provided
,
however
, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all the Banks do any of the following (except as provided in the immediately succeeding proviso): (1) reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees due hereunder or any other amount due hereunder or under any other Loan Document; (2) postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts due hereunder or under any other Loan Document; (3) change the definition of Required Banks; (4) amend this Section 12.02 or any other provision requiring the consent of all the Banks; (5) waive any default in payment under paragraph (1) of Section 9.01 or any default under paragraph (5) of Section 9.01; (6) increase or decrease any Loan Commitment of any Bank (except changes in Loan Commitments pursuant to Section 2.16); (7) release the Guaranty; (8) permit the expiration date of any Letter of Credit to be after the Maturity Date (except as provided in Section 2.17(e)); or (9) permit the assignment or transfer by the Borrower or the General Partner of any of its rights or obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document(except in a transaction permitted pursuant to Section 7.01); and

No failure on the part of Administrative Agent or any Bank to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof or preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.

Each Bank shall reply promptly, but in any event within fifteen (15) Banking Days (or five (5) Banking Days with respect to any decision to accelerate or stop acceleration of the Loan) after receipt of the request therefor by Administrative Agent (the "Bank Reply Period"). Unless a Bank shall give written notice to Administrative Agent that it objects to the recommendation or determination of Administrative Agent within the Bank Reply Period, such Bank shall be deemed to have approved or consented to such recommendation or determination.
SECTION 12.04.        
Expenses; Indemnification
. Borrower agrees to reimburse Administrative Agent on demand for all reasonable costs, expenses, and charges (including, without limitation, all reasonable fees and charges of engineers, appraisers and external legal counsel) incurred by Administrative Agent in connection with the Loans and to reimburse each of the Banks for reasonable legal costs, expenses and charges incurred by each of the Banks in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement, the Notes, or any other Loan Documents;

SECTION 12.05.        
Assignment; Participation
. (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, Borrower, Administrative Agent, the Banks and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

61
 
(b)       Subject to Section 12.05(e), prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, any Bank may at any time, grant to an existing Bank or one or more banks, finance companies, insurance companies or other entities (a "
Participant
") in minimum amounts of not less than $5,000,000 (or any lesser amount in the case of participations to an existing Bank) participating interests in its Loan Commitment or any or all of its Loans. After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, any Bank may at any time grant to any Person in any amount (also a "
Participant
"), participating interests in its Loan Commitment or any or all of its Loans. Any participation made during the continuation of an Event of Default shall not be affected by the subsequent cure of such Event of Default. In the event of any such grant by a Bank of a participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon notice to Borrower and Administrative Agent, such Bank shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and Borrower and Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which any Bank may grant such a participating interest shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of Borrower hereunder and under any other Loan Document including, without limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that such participation agreement may provide that such Bank will not agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement described in clause (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) or (7) of Section 12.02 without the consent of the Participant (subject to the final proviso of the first sentence of Section 12.02). The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall, to the extent provided in its participation agreement, be entitled to the benefits of Article III with respect to its participating interest.
(c)       Subject to Section 12.05(e), any Bank may at any time assign to a Qualified Institution (in each case, an "
Assignee
") (i) prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, in minimum amounts of not less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) and integral multiples of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) thereafter (or any lesser amount in the case of assignments to an existing Bank) and (ii) after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, in any amount, all or a proportionate part of all, of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents, and, in either case, such Assignee shall assume such rights and obligations, pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement executed by such Assignee and such transferor Bank; provided, that such assignment shall be subject to the consent of the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Bank and if no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the consent of Borrower, which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and
provided
further
that if an Assignee is a Bank Affiliate of such transferor Bank or was a Bank immediately prior to such assignment, no such consent shall be required; and
provided
further
that such assignment may, but need not, include rights of the transferor Bank in respect of outstanding Bid Rate Loans. Upon execution and delivery of such instrument and payment by such Assignee to such transferor Bank of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such transferor Bank and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Bank party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank with a Loan Commitment as set forth in such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, and no further consent or action by any party shall be required and the transferor Bank shall be released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent. Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this subsection (c), the transferor Bank, Administrative Agent and Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, a new Note is issued to the
 
62
 
Assignee. In connection with any such assignment (other than an assignment by a Bank to an affiliate), the transferor Bank shall pay to Administrative Agent an administrative fee for processing such assignment in the amount of $3,500. If the Assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof, it shall, prior to the first date on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for its account, deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with Section 10.13. Any assignment made during the continuation of an Event of Default shall not be affected by any subsequent cure of such Event of Default.
(d)       Any Bank may at any time assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Note to a Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment shall release the transferor Bank from its obligations hereunder.
(e)       Except as provided in Section 12.05(d), so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, no Bank shall be permitted to enter into an assignment of, or sell a participation interest in, its Loans and Loan Commitment, which would result in such Bank holding Loans and a Loan Commitment, without Participants, of less than Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) unless as a result of a decrease of the aggregate Loan Commitments pursuant to Section 2.16;
provided
,
however
, that no Bank shall be prohibited from assigning its entire Loans and Commitment so long as such assignment is otherwise permitted hereby.
(f)        Borrower recognizes that in connection with a Bank's selling of Participations or making of assignments, any or all documentation, financial statements and other data, or copies thereof, relevant to Borrower or the Loans may be exhibited to and retained by any such Participant or assignee or prospective Participant or assignee. In connection with a Bank's delivery of any financial statements and appraisals to any such Participant or assignee or prospective Participant or assignee, such Bank shall also indicate that the same are delivered on a confidential basis. Borrower agrees to provide all assistance reasonably requested by a Bank to enable such Bank to sell Participations or make assignments of its Loan and Loan Commitment as permitted by this Section 12.05. Each Bank agrees to provide Borrower with advance notice of all Participations to be sold by such Bank.

SECTION 12.08.        
Setoff
. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, to the extent permitted or not expressly prohibited by applicable law, Borrower and General Partner agree that, in addition to (and without limitation of) any right of setoff, bankers' lien or counterclaim a Bank may otherwise have, each Bank shall be entitled, at its option, to offset balances (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) held by it for the account of Borrower or General Partner at any of such Bank's offices, in Dollars or in any other currency, against any amount payable by Borrower or General Partner to such Bank under this Agreement or such Bank's Note, or any other Loan Document, which is not paid when due (regardless of whether such balances are then due to Borrower or General Partner), in which case it shall promptly notify Borrower, General Partner and Administrative Agent thereof;
provided
that such Bank's failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity thereof. Payments by Borrower or General Partner hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall be made without setoff or counterclaim.
SECTION 12.09.

SECTION 12.15.        
Jurisdiction; Immunities
. Borrower, General Partner, Administrative Agent and each Bank hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of any New York State or United States Federal court sitting in New York City over any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document. Borrower, General Partner, Administrative Agent, and each Bank irrevocably agree that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or United States Federal court. Borrower, General Partner, Administrative Agent, and each Bank irrevocably consent to the service of any and all process in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies of such process to Borrower, General Partner, Administrative Agent or each Bank, as the case may be, at the addresses specified herein. Borrower, General Partner, Administrative Agent and each Bank agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Borrower, General Partner, Administrative Agent and each Bank further waive any objection to venue in the State of New York and any objection to an action or proceeding in the State of New York on the basis of forum non conveniens. Borrower, General Partner, Administrative Agent and each Bank agree that any action or proceeding brought against Borrower, General Partner, Administrative Agent or any Bank, as the case may be, shall be brought only in a New York State court sitting in New York City or a United States Federal court sitting in New York City, to the extent permitted or not expressly prohibited by applicable law.
Nothing in this Section shall affect the right of Borrower, General Partner, Administrative Agent or any Bank to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law.
To the extent that Borrower, General Partner, Administrative Agent or any Bank have or hereafter may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether from service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, Borrower, General Partner, Administrative Agent and each Bank hereby irrevocably waive such immunity in respect of its obligations under this Agreement, the Notes and any other Loan Document.

IN ADDITION, BORROWER AND GENERAL PARTNER HEREBY WAIVE, IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR
 
65
 
THE BANKS WITH RESPECT TO THE NOTES, ANY RIGHT BORROWER OR GENERAL PARTNER, MAY HAVE (1) TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED OR NOT EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TO INTERPOSE ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN (OTHER THAN A COUNTERCLAIM THAT IF NOT BROUGHT IN THE SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR THE BANKS COULD NOT BE BROUGHT IN A SEPARATE SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING OR WOULD BE SUBJECT TO DISMISSAL OR SIMILAR DISPOSITION FOR FAILURE TO HAVE BEEN ASSERTED IN SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR THE BANKS) OR (2) TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED OR NOT EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TO HAVE THE SAME CONSOLIDATED WITH ANY OTHER OR SEPARATE SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. NOTHING HEREIN CONTAINED SHALL PREVENT OR PROHIBIT BORROWER OR GENERAL PARTNER FROM INSTITUTING OR MAINTAINING A SEPARATE ACTION AGAINST ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR THE BANKS WITH RESPECT TO ANY ASSERTED CLAIM.
To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, neither the Borrower nor the General Partner shall assert, and each of Borrower and the General Partner hereby waives, any claim against any Bank or any Agent, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or other extension of credit hereunder or the use of the proceeds thereof.
SECTION 12.16.        
Designated Lender
. Any Bank (other than an Affected Bank or a Bank which is such solely because it is a Designated Lender) (each, a "Designating Lender") may at any time designate one (1) Designated Lender to fund Bid Rate Loans on behalf of such Designating Lender subject to the terms of this Section and the provisions in Section 12.05 shall not apply to such designation. No Bank may designate more than one (1) Designated Lender. The parties to each such designation shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent for its acceptance a Designation Agreement. Upon such receipt of an appropriately completed Designation Agreement executed by a Designating Lender and a designee representing that it is a Designated Lender, Administrative Agent will accept such Designation Agreement and give prompt notice thereof to Borrower, whereupon, (i) from and after the "Effective Date" specified in the Designation Agreement, the Designated Lender shall become a party to this Agreement with a right to make Bid Rate Loans on behalf of its Designating Lender pursuant to Section 2.02 after Borrower has accepted the Bid Rate Quote of the Designating Lender and (ii) the Designated Lender shall not be required to make payments with respect to any obligations in this Agreement except to the extent of excess cash flow of such Designated Lender which is not otherwise required to repay obligations of such Designated Lender which are then due and payable;
provided
,
however
, that regardless of such designation and assumption by the Designated Lender, the Designating Lender shall be and remain obligated to Borrower, Administrative Agent and the Banks for each and every one of the obligations of the Designating Lender and its related Designated Lender with respect to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any indemnification obligations under Section 10.05. Each Designating Lender shall serve as the administrative agent of its Designated Lender and shall on behalf of, and to the exclusion of, the Designated Lender (i) receive any and all payments made for the benefit of the
 
66
 
Designated Lender and (ii) give and receive all communications and notices and take all actions hereunder, including, without limitation, votes, approvals, waivers and consents under or relating to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Any such notice, communication, vote, approval, waiver or consent shall be signed by the Designating Lender as administrative agent for the Designated Lender and shall not be signed by the Designated Lender on its own behalf, but shall be binding on the Designated Lender to the same extent as if actually signed by the Designated Lender. Borrower, Administrative Agent and the Banks may rely thereon without any requirement that the Designated Lender sign or acknowledge the same. No Designated Lender may assign or transfer all or any portion of its interest hereunder or under any other Loan Document, other than assignments to the Designating Lender which originally designated such Designated Lender.
SECTION 12.17.        
No Bankruptcy Proceedings
. Each of Borrower, the Banks and Administrative Agent hereby agrees that it will not institute against any Designated Lender or join any other Person in instituting against any Designated Lender any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding under any federal or state bankruptcy or similar law, for 366 days after the payment in full of the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by such Designated Lender.
(a) Neither Borrower, General Partner nor any subsidiary of any of the foregoing intends to treat the Loan or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as being a "reportable transaction" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4). If Borrower or any other such Person determines to take any action inconsistent with such intention, Borrower shall promptly notify Administrative Agent thereof. If Borrower so notifies Administrative Agent, Borrower acknowledges that Administrative Agent and the Banks may treat the Loan as part of a transaction that is subject to Treasury Regulation Section 301.6112-1, and Administrative Agent and the Banks will maintain the lists and other records, including the identity of the applicable party to the Loan as required by such Treasury Regulation.
(b)       Notwithstanding anything provided in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties to this Agreement (and each employee, representative, or other agent of the parties) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and any facts that may be relevant to the tax structure of the transaction, provided, however, that no party to this Agreement (and no employee, representative, or other agent thereof) shall disclose any other information that is not relevant to understanding the tax treatment and tax structure of the transaction (including the identity of any party to this Agreement and any information that could lead another to determine the identity of any party to this Agreement), or any other information to the extent that such disclosure could result in a violation of any federal or state securities law.
SECTION 12.19.
USA Patriot Act
. Each Bank hereby notifies the Borrower and the General Partner that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "
Act
"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower and the General Partner, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and the General
 
67
 
Partner and other information that will allow such Bank to identify the Borrower and the General Partner in accordance with the Act.

calendar quarters, in both cases, capitalized at a rate of 6.50% per annum, and (y) the Gross Book Value of such businesses; (2) with respect to Other Investments, which do not have publicly traded shares, the Net Equity Value of such Other Investments; (3) with respect to Real Property UJVs, which do not have publicly traded shares, individually determined, the greater of (x) Combined EBITDA from such Real Property UJVs (a) in the case of all Real Property UJVs other than those owning hotels and trade show space, for the most recently ended calendar quarter, annualized (i.e., multiplied by four), and (b) in the case of Real Property UJVs owning hotels and trade show space, for the most recently ended four consecutive calendar quarters, in both cases, capitalized at the rate of 6.50%, less Borrower's pro rata share of any Indebtedness attributable to such UJVs, and (y) the Net Equity Value of such Real Property UJVs; and (4) without duplication, Borrower's pro rata share of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, the book value of notes and mortgage loans receivable and capitalized development costs (exclusive of tenant improvements and tenant leasing commission costs), and the fair market value of publicly traded securities, at such time, all as determined in accordance with GAAP.

provided
however
, that Combined EBITDA shall include only general and administrative expenses that are attributable to the management and operation of the assets in accordance with GAAP and shall not include any corporate general and administrative expenses of Borrower, General Partner, Consolidated Businesses or UJVs (e.g., salaries of corporate officers).
