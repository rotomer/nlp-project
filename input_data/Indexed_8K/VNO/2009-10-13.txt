Overview
We own and operate office, retail and showroom properties (our "core" operations) with large concentrations of office and retail properties in the New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia areas. In addition, we have a 32.7% interest in Toys "R" Us, Inc. ("Toys") which has a significant real estate component, a 32.5% interest in Alexander's, Inc., which has seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, as well as interests in other real estate and related investments.
 
Our ultimate business objective is to maximize shareholder value, which we measure by the total return provided to our shareholders. The table below compares our performance to the Morgan Stanley REIT Index ("RMS") and the SNL REIT Index ("SNL") for the following periods ending December 31, 2008 (past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance):
 
 
We intend to achieve our ultimate business objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through:
 
 
We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets.
 
We compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national, regional and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends. See "Risk Factors" in Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors.
 
In the second half of 2007 the residential mortgage and capital markets began showing signs of stress, primarily in the form of escalating default rates on sub-prime mortgages, declining home values and increasing inventory nationwide. In 2008, the "credit crisis" spread to the broader commercial credit and financial markets resulting in illiquidity and volatility in the bond and equity markets. We are currently in an economic recession which has negatively affected all businesses, including ours. During the past year, real estate transactions have diminished significantly and capitalization rates have risen. Our real estate portfolio may be affected by declining demand for office and retail space and tenant bankruptcies, which may result in lower average occupancy rates and effective rents, and a corresponding decrease in net income, funds from operations and cash flow. In addition, the value of our assets, including investments in joint ventures, marketable securities, and mezzanine loans may also decline, and may result in impairment charges and/or valuation allowances and a corresponding decrease in net income and funds from operations.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we did not recognize income on certain assets with an aggregate carrying amount of approximately $1.6 billion at December 31, 2008, because they were out of service for redevelopment, although we capitalized approximately $63,000,000 of interest costs in connection with the development of these assets. Assets under development include all or portions of: the Bergen Town Center, the Manhattan Mall, 220 20 Street, 1229-1231 25 Street ("West End 25"), 1999 K Street, and certain investments in partially owned entities.

Significant Activity during 2008
 
 
Reversal of Deferred Tax Liabilities
 
In connection with the purchase accounting for H Street, in July 2005 and April 2007 we recorded an aggregate of $222,174,000 of deferred tax liabilities representing the differences between the tax basis and the book basis of the acquired assets and liabilities multiplied by the effective tax rate. We were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of January 16, 2008, we had completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, in the first quarter of 2008, we reversed the deferred tax liabilities and recognized an income tax benefit of $222,174,000 in our consolidated statement of income.
Lexington Realty Trust ("Lexington") (NYSE: LXP)
 
Prior to October 28, 2008, we owned 8,149,592 limited partnership units of the Lexington Master Limited Partnership ("Lexington MLP") which were exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into Lexington common shares, or a 7.7% limited partnership interest. On October 28, 2008, we acquired 8,000,000 common shares of Lexington for $5.60 per share, or $44,800,000. The purchase price consisted of $22,400,000 in cash and a $22,400,000 margin loan recourse only to the 8,000,000 shares acquired. In addition, we exchanged our existing limited partnership units in Lexington MLP for 8,149,592 Lexington common shares. As of December 31, 2008, we own 16,149,592 Lexington common shares, or approximately 17.2% of Lexington's common equity. We account for our investment in Lexington on the equity method and record our pro rata share of Lexington's net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time that Lexington files its financial statements.
 
Based on Lexington's December 31, 2008 closing share price of $5.00, the market value ("fair value" pursuant to SFAS 157) of our investment in Lexington was $80,748,000, or $100,707,000 below the carrying amount on our consolidated balance sheet. We have concluded that our investment in Lexington is "other-than-temporarily" impaired and recorded a $100,707,000 non-cash impairment loss in the fourth quarter of 2008. Together with the impairment charge recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2008, we recognized an aggregate of $107,882,000 of non-cash charges on our investment in Lexington during 2008. Our conclusions were based on the recent deterioration in the capital and financial markets and our inability to forecast a recovery in the near-term. These charges are included as a component of "(loss) income from partially owned entities," on our consolidated statement of income.
 
Marketable Securities
 
At December 31, 2008, we concluded that certain of our investments in marketable equity securities were "other-than-temporarily" impaired, based on the severity and duration of the declines in the market value ("fair value" pursuant to SFAS 157) of these securities and recognized non-cash impairment charges aggregating $55,471,000, based on December 31, 2008 closing share prices. Together with impairment charges recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2008, we recognized an aggregate of $76,352,000 of non-cash impairment charges on these investments during 2008. Our conclusions were based on the recent deterioration in the capital and financial markets and our inability to forecast a recovery in the near-term. These charges are included as a component of "interest and other investment (loss) income, net," on our consolidated statement of income.
Real Estate Development Projects
 
During 2008, we recognized non-cash charges aggregating $96,037,000, for the write-off of our share of certain partially owned entities' development costs, as these projects were either deferred or abandoned. These charges include $37,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2008, for our 50% share of costs in connection with the redevelopment of the Filene's property in Boston, Massachusetts and $23,000,000 in the first quarter of 2008, for our 50% share of costs in connection with the abandonment of the "arena move"/Moynihan East portions of the Farley project. These charges are included as a component of "(loss) income from partially owned entities," on our consolidated statement of income.
 
During 2008, we also recognized non-cash charges aggregating $81,447,000, of which $73,438,000 was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily related to residential condominium projects under development.

MPH Mezzanine Loan
 
On June 5, 2007, we acquired a 42% interest in two MPH mezzanine loans totaling $158,700,000, for $66,000,000 in cash. The loans, which were due on February 8, 2008 and have not been repaid, are subordinate to $2.9 billion of mortgage and other debt and secured by the equity interests in four New York City properties: Worldwide Plaza, 1540 Broadway office condominium, 527 Madison Avenue and Tower 56. At December 31, 2007, we reduced the net carrying amount of the loans to $9,000,000 by recognizing a $57,000,000 non-cash charge in our consolidated statement of income. On April 2, 2008, we sold a sub-participation interest in the loans for $19,300,000, which resulted in the reduction of our valuation allowance from $57,000,000 to $46,700,000 and the recognition of $10,300,000 of non-cash income in our consolidated statement of income.
 
Dispositions
 
On March 31, 2008, we sold our 47.6% interest in Americold, our Temperature Controlled Logistics segment, for $220,000,000, in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $112,690,000, which is included as a component of "income from discontinued operations" on our consolidated statement of income.
 
On June 6, 2008, we sold our Tysons Dulles Plaza office building complex located in Tysons Corner, Virginia for approximately $152,800,000, in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $56,831,000, which is included as a component of "income from discontinued operations" on our consolidated statement of income.
 
Pursuant to the sale of GMH Communities L.P. ("GMH") military housing division and the merger of its student housing division with American Campus Communities, Inc ("ACC") (NYSE: ACC), in June 2008 we received an aggregate of $105,180,000, consisting of $82,142,000 in cash and 753,126 shares of ACC common stock valued at $23,038,000 based on ACC's then closing share price of $30.59, in exchange for our entire interest in GMH. We subsequently sold all of the ACC common shares. The above transactions resulted in a net gain of $2,038,000, which was recognized in the second quarter of 2008, and is included as a component of "net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate" on our consolidated statement of income. The aggregate net income realized from inception of this investment in 2004 through its disposition was $77,000,000.
 
Financings
 
During 2008 we completed approximately $1.3 billion of property level financings and repaid approximately $241,000,000 of existing debt with a portion of the proceeds. In addition, we purchased $81,540,000 (aggregate face amount) of our 4.50% senior unsecured notes due August 15, 2009, for $80,408,000 in cash, resulting in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $783,000. We also purchased $10,200,000 and $17,300,000 (aggregate face amounts) of our 3.63% and 2.85% convertible senior debentures, respectively, for an aggregate of $18,080,000 in cash, resulting in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $9,037,000. These gains are included as a reduction of "interest and debt expense" on our consolidated statement of income.
 
 
The net proceeds we received from the above dispositions and financings were used primarily for general corporate purposes. We may seek to obtain additional capital through equity offerings, debt financings or asset sales, although there is no express policy with respect to these capital markets transactions. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities in the future.

Leasing Activity
 
The following table sets forth certain information for the properties we own directly or indirectly, including leasing activity. The leasing activity presented below is based on leases signed during the period and is not intended to coincide with the commencement of rental revenue recognition in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Tenant improvements and leasing commissions are presented below based on square feet leased during the period, on a per square foot and per square foot per annum basis based on weighted average lease terms and as a percentage of initial rent per square foot.

Critical Accounting Policies
 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Real Estate
 
Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, were $15.710 billion and $15.228 billion, respectively. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components. If we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate, depreciation expense may be misstated.
 
Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles such as acquired above and below market leases and acquired in-place leases and customer relationships) and acquired liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and we allocate purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions.
 
Our properties, including any related intangible assets, are individually reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over our anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property's carrying amount over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, our anticipated holding period for properties, or the estimated fair value of properties change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment charges may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.
 
Identified Intangible Assets
 
Upon an acquisition of a business we record intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill. We amortize identified intangible assets that are determined to have finite lives which are based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset, including the related real estate when appropriate, is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value.
 
As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets, a component of "other assets" on our consolidated balance sheets, were $525,950,000 and $563,359,000, respectively. In addition, the carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities, a component of "deferred credit" on our consolidated balance sheets, were $719,822,000 and $814,098,000, respectively. If the intangible assets are deemed to be impaired, or the estimated useful lives of finite-life intangibles assets or liabilities change, the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material.

Critical Accounting Policies  continued
 
Mezzanine Loans Receivable
 
We invest in mezzanine loans to entities which have significant real estate assets. These investments, which are subordinate to the mortgage loans secured by the real property, are generally secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate. We record investments in mezzanine loans at the stated principal amount net of any unamortized discount or premium. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying amounts of "mezzanine loans receivable" were $472,539,000 and $492,339,000, respectively. We accrete or amortize any discounts or premiums over the life of the related receivable utilizing the effective interest method, or straight-line method if the result is not materially different. We evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of our loans, if circumstances warrant, in determining whether they are impaired. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the estimated fair value of the loan or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If our estimates of the collectibility of both interest and principal or the fair value of our loans change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment charges may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
 
Partially Owned Entities
 
As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying amounts of investments and advances to partially owned entities, including Alexander's and Toys "R" Us, were $1.083 billion and $1.505 billion, respectively. In determining whether we have a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which we will absorb the majority of the entity's expected losses, if they occur, or receive the majority of the expected residual returns, if they occur, or both. We account for investments on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method.
 
Our investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, the nature of development activities for properties for which such activities are planned, and the estimated fair value of the investment change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment charges may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results.
 
Allowance For Doubtful Accounts
 
We periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts ($32,834,000 and $19,151,000 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007) for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents ($5,773,000 and $3,076,000 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007). This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition
 
We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Before we recognize revenue, we assess, among other things, its collectibility. If our assessment of the collectibility of revenue changes, the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material.
 
Income Taxes
 
We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT") under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. We distribute to our shareholders 100% of our taxable income. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If we fail to distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders, or fail to meet other REIT requirements, we may fail to qualify as a REIT which may result in substantial adverse tax consequences.

Recently Issued Accounting Literature
In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement No. 157,
Fair Value Measurements
("SFAS 157").
SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 was effective for our financial assets and liabilities on January 1, 2008.  The FASB has deferred the implementation of the provisions of SFAS 157 relating to certain non-financial assets and liabilities until January 1, 2009. This standard did not materially affect how we determine fair value, but resulted in certain additional disclosures. SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three levels: Level 1  quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities; Level 2  observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data; and Level 3  unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value. Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in our consolidated financial statements primarily consist of (i) marketable securities, (ii) the assets of our deferred compensation plan (primarily marketable securities and equity investments in limited partnerships), for which there is a corresponding liability on our consolidated balance sheets and (iii) Class A units of the Operating Partnership, held by third-parties. Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of December 31, 2008 are presented in the table below based on their level in the fair value hierarchy.
 
___________________
(1) We chose not to elect the fair value option prescribed by Statement No. 159,
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
("SFAS 159"), for our financial assets and liabilities that had not been previously measured at fair value. These financial assets and liabilities include our outstanding debt, accounts receivable, accounts payable and investments in partially owned entities.
 
The fair value of Level 3 "deferred compensation plan assets" represents equity investments in certain limited partnerships, for which there is a corresponding Level 3 liability to the plan's participants. The following is a summary of changes in Level 3 deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities, for the year ended December 31, 2008.
 
 
 
 
15
 
 
Recently Issued Accounting Literature - continued
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159, which permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.  SFAS 159 was effective on January 1, 2008. We did not elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial instruments on the effective date and have not determined whether we will elect this option for any eligible financial instruments we acquire in the future.
 
In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141R,
Business Combinations
("SFAS 141R"). SFAS 141R broadens the guidance of SFAS 141, extending its applicability to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses. SFAS 141R also broadens the fair value measurement and recognition of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and interests transferred as a result of business combinations; and acquisition related costs will generally be expensed rather than included as part of the basis of the acquisition. SFAS 141R expands required disclosures to improve the ability to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations. SFAS 141R is effective for all transactions entered into on or after January 1, 2009. The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2009 could materially impact our future financial results to the extent that we acquire significant amounts of real estate, in part because acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred compared to our current practice of capitalizing such costs and amortizing them over the estimated useful life of the assets acquired.
 
In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160,
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - An Amendment of ARB No. 51
("SFAS 160"). SFAS 160 requires a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to be reported as equity and the amount of consolidated net income specifically attributable to the noncontrolling interest to be identified in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 also calls for consistency in the manner of reporting changes in the parent's ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation. As of December 31, 2008, as part of our preparation for the adoption of SFAS 160, which is effective for us on January 1, 2009, we have retroactively adopted the measurement provisions of EITF Topic D-98,
Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities
. Upon adoption, we adjusted the carrying amounts of the Class A units held by third parties, a component of "redeemable noncontrolling interests" on our consolidated balance sheets, by recognizing a $639,447,000 increase to the January 1, 2006 balance of "redeemable noncontrolling interests" and a corresponding decrease in "earnings in excess of (less than) distributions," which was accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment on January 1, 2006. Subsequent adjustments to the carrying amounts of the Class A units, to reflect the change in their redemption value at the end of each reporting period, were recorded to "additional capital." The effects of retrospectively applying SFAS 160, resulted in (i) the reclassification of minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries to noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, a component of permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheets, (ii) the reclassification of minority interest expense to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, on our consolidated statements of income, and (iii) additional disclosures, including a consolidated statement of changes in equity in quarterly reporting periods.
 
In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161,
Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133
("SFAS 161")
.
SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures related to derivative instruments and hedging activities, including disclosures regarding how an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FASB Statement No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,
and the impact of derivative instruments and related hedged items on an entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective on January 1, 2009. We believe that the adoption of this standard on January 1, 2009 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Literature - continued
On January 1, 2009, we adopted FASB Staff Position APB 14-1,
Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that may be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)
("FSP 14-1"), which was required to be applied retrospectively. The adoption of FSP 14-1 affected the accounting for our convertible and exchangeable senior debentures by requiring the initial proceeds from their sale to be allocated between a debt component and an equity component in a manner that results in interest expense on the debt component at our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate on the date of issue. The initial debt components of our $1.4 billion Convertible Senior Debentures, $1 billion Convertible Senior Debentures and $500 million Exchangeable Senior Debentures were $1,241,286,000, $926,361,000 and $457,699,000, respectively, based on the fair value of similar nonconvertible instruments issued at that time. The aggregate initial debt discount of $216,655,000 after original issuance costs allocated to the equity component was recorded in "additional capital" in our consolidated statement of changes in equity. We are amortizing the discount using the effective interest method over the period the debt is expected to remain outstanding (i.e., the earliest date the holders may require us to repurchase the debentures), as additional interest expense. Accordingly, interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 has been adjusted to include $39,546,000, 30,418,000 and $5,969,000 of amortization in the aggregate, or $35,746,000, $27,367,000 and $5,358,000, net of amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests. Amortization for periods prior to December 31, 2005 (not presented herein) aggregating $2,724,000 have been reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in "earnings in excess (less than) distributions" on our consolidated statement of changes in equity. Below is a summary of the financial statement effects of implementing FSP 14-1 and related disclosures.

In May 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 163,
Accounting for Financial Guarantee Insurance Contracts
("SFAS 163").
SFAS 163
was issued to decrease inconsistencies within Statement No. 60,
Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises
, and clarify how it applies to financial guarantee insurance contracts issued by insurance enterprises, including the recognition of premium revenue and claim liabilities. SFAS 163 also requires expanded disclosures about financial guarantee insurance contracts. SFAS 163 is effective on January 1, 2009. We believe that the adoption of this standard on January 1, 2009 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
 
In June 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue 07-5,
Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity's Own Stock
("EITF 07-5"). Paragraph 11(a) of SFAS 133 specifies that a contract that would otherwise meet the definition of a derivative but is both (a) indexed to the company's own stock and (b) classified in stockholders' equity in the statement of financial position would not be considered a derivative financial instrument. EITF 07-5 provides a new two-step model to be applied in determining whether a financial instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an issuer's own stock and thus able to qualify for the SFAS 133 paragraph 11(a) scope exception. EITF 07-5 is effective on January 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.
 
In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF 03-6-1,
Determining Whether Investments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities
("FSP 03-6-1"). FSP 03-6-1 requires companies to treat unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents as "participating securities" and include such securities in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method as described in SFAS 128. FSP 03-6-1 became effective on January 1, 2009 and required all prior period earnings per share data presented, to be adjusted retroactively. The adoption of FSP 03-6-1 on January 1, 2009 did not have a material effect on our computation of income per share.

Income Applicable to Alexander's
Our 32.5% share of income applicable to Alexander's (comprised of our share of Alexander's net income, management, leasing and development fees) was $36,671,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $50,589,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $13,918,000. The decrease was primarily due to $6,583,000 of income for our share of the reversal of accrued stock appreciation rights compensation expense, compared to $14,280,000 in the prior year.
 
Income (loss) Applicable to Toys
 
 
Our 32.7% share of Toys' financial results (comprised of our share of Toys' net income, interest income on loans receivable, and management fees) for the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 are for Toys fiscal periods from November 4, 2007 to November 1, 2008 and October 29, 2006 to November 3, 2007, respectively. In the year ended December 31, 2008, our income applicable to Toys was $2,380,000, or $62,032,000 before our share of Toys' income tax expense, compared to a loss of $14,337,000 or $25,235,000 before our share of Toys' income tax benefit in the prior year.

Interest and Other Investment (Loss) Income, net
Interest and other investment (loss) income, net (comprised of mark-to-market of derivative positions, interest income on mezzanine loans receivable, other interest and dividend income and impairment charges on marketable securities) was ($2,682,000) for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $226,425,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, a decrease of $229,107,000. This decrease resulted primarily from:
 
 
Interest and Debt Expense
Interest and debt expense was $625,904,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $599,804,000 in the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $26,100,000. This increase was primarily due to an $812 million increase in average outstanding debt from property financings and refinancings, partially offset by a $9,820,000 net gain on early extinguishment of debt.
 
Net Gains on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially Owned Assets other than Depreciable Real Estate
Net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate was $7,757,000 in the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $39,493,000 in the year ended December 31, 2007. The year ended December 31, 2008 includes a $3,691,000 pre-tax gain on sale of residential condominiums, a $2,038,000 net gain on disposition of our 13.8% interest in GMH and $2,028,000 for net gains on sale of marketable securities. The $39,493,000 net gain in the year ended December 31, 2007 represents net gains on sale of marketable securities, including $23,090,000 from the sale of McDonald's common shares.

Income Tax Expense
 
In the year ended December 31, 2008, we had an income tax benefit of $204,537,000, compared to an expense of $9,179,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $213,716,000. The decrease results primarily from a $222,174,000 reversal of deferred taxes recorded in connection with the acquisition of H Street. We were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of January 16, 2008, we had completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, in the first quarter of 2008, we reversed the deferred tax liabilities and recognized an income tax benefit of $222,174,000 in our consolidated statement of income.
 
Discontinued Operations
The combined results of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 include the operating results of Americold, which was sold on March 31, 2008; Tysons Dulles Plaza, which was sold on June 10, 2008; 19.6 acres of land we acquired as part of our acquisition of H Street, of which 11 acres were sold in September 2007; Vineland, New Jersey, which was sold on July 16, 2007; Crystal Mall Two, which was sold on August 9, 2007; Arlington Plaza, which was sold on October 17, 2007.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 is comprised of (i) allocations of income to redeemable noncontrolling interests of $33,327,000 and $50,514,000, respectively, (ii) net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries of $3,263,000 and $3,494,000, respectively and (iii) preferred unit distributions of the Operating Partnership of $22,084,000 and $19,274,000, respectively. The decrease of $17,187,000 in allocations of income to redeemable noncontrolling interests resulted primarily from lower net income subject to allocation to the unitholders. The increase of $2,810,000 in preferred unit distributions of the Operating Partnership was due to the amortization of unit issuance costs in connection with our adoption of the measurement provisions of EITF Topic D-98.
 
Preferred Share Dividends
Preferred share dividends were $57,091,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $57,177,000 for the prior year.

Income Applicable to Alexander's
Income applicable to Alexander's (loan interest income, management, leasing, development and commitment fees, and equity in income) was $50,589,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to a loss of $14,530,000 for the prior year, an increase of $65,119,000. The increase was primarily due to (i) our $14,280,000 share of income in 2007 for the reversal of accrued stock appreciation rights compensation expense as compared to $49,043,000 for our share of expense in the prior year, (ii) an increase of $3,504,000 in our equity in earnings of Alexander's before stock appreciation rights and net gains on sales of condominiums, (iii) an increase of $3,758,000 in development fees in 2007, partially offset by (iv) our $4,580,000 share of Alexander's net gain on sale of 731 Lexington Avenue condominiums in the prior year and (v) a $1,305,000 decrease in leasing fee income.
 
Loss Applicable to Toys
 
 
Our 32.7% share of Toys' financial results (comprised of our share of Toys' net loss, interest income on loans receivable, and management fees) for the years ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 are for Toys fiscal periods from October 29, 2006 to November 3, 2007 and October 30, 2005 to October 28, 2006, respectively. In the year ended December 31, 2007, our loss applicable to Toys was $14,337,000, or $25,235,000 before our share of Toys' income tax benefit, as compared to $47,520,000 or $70,147,000 before our share of Toys' income tax benefit in the prior year. The decrease in our loss applicable to Toys before income tax benefit of $44,912,000 results primarily from (i) an increase in Toys' net sales due to improvements in comparable store sales across all divisions and benefits in foreign currency translation, (ii) a net gain related to a lease termination, (iii) decreased interest expense primarily due to reduced borrowings and reduced amortization of deferred financing costs, partially offset by, (iv) an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, which as a percentage of net sales were 27.7% and 26.4% for the twelve month periods ended November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006, respectively, as a result of higher payroll, store occupancy, corporate and advertising expenses.

Interest and Other Investment Income
Interest and other investment income (interest income on mezzanine loans receivable, other interest income and dividend income) was $226,425,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $255,391,000 in the year ended December 31, 2006, a decrease of $28,966,000. This decrease resulted primarily from the following:
 
 
 
Interest and Debt Expense
Interest and debt expense was $599,804,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $400,540,000 in the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $199,264,000. This increase was primarily due to (i) $80,255,000 from approximately $1.713 billion of mortgage financings and refinancings on our existing property portfolio during 2007 and 2006, (ii) $67,780,000 from a $1.754 billion of mortgage debt resulting from property acquisitions, (iii) $94,881,000 from senior unsecured financings, including $1.0 billion issued in November 2006 and $1.4 billion issued in March 2007, partially offset by, (iv) an increase of $28,240,000 in the amount of capitalized interest relating to a larger amount of assets under development in 2007, (v) $19,344,000 less interest in 2007 from the redemption of $500,000,000 of senior unsecured notes in May 2007, and (vi) $3,582,000 of expense in 2006 from early extinguishments of debt.
 
Net Gains on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially Owned Assets other than Depreciable Real Estate
Net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate was $39,493,000 and $76,073,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and consists primarily of net gains from sales of marketable equity securities, including $23,090,000 from the sale of McDonalds common shares in 2007 and $55,438,000 from the sale of Sears Canada common shares in 2006.

Income Tax Expense
 
Income tax expense was $9,179,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $491,000 for the prior year, an increase of $8,688,000. This increase results primarily from (i) the consolidation of two H Street corporations beginning on April 30, 2007, the date we acquired the remaining 50% of these corporations we did not previously own (we previously accounted for our 50% investment on the equity method) and (ii) $4,622,000 of Federal withholding tax on dividends paid to foreign corporations in connection with 1290 Avenue of the Americas and 555 California Street, which we acquired in May 2007.
 
Discontinued Operations
The combined results of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 include the operating results of Americold; Tysons Dulles Plaza; 19.6 acres of land we acquired as part of our acquisition of H Street, of which 11 acres were sold in September 2007; Vineland, New Jersey, which was sold on July 16, 2007; Crystal Mall Two, which was sold on August 9, 2007; Arlington Plaza, which was sold on October 17, 2007; 33 North Dearborn Street in Chicago, Illinois, which was sold on March 14, 2006; 424 Sixth Avenue in New York City, which was sold on March 13, 2006 and 1919 South Eads Street in Arlington, Virginia, which was sold on June 22, 2006.
 
 
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests, Including Unit Distributions
 
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 is comprised of (i) allocations of income to redeemable noncontrolling interests of $50,514,000 and $58,089,000, respectively, (ii) net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries of $3,494,000 and $1,363,000, respectively and (iii) preferred unit distributions of the Operating Partnership of $19,274,000 and $21,848,000, respectively. The decrease of $7,576,000 in allocations of income to redeemable noncontrolling interests resulted primarily from a decrease in the noncontrolling interests' ownership due to the conversion of Class A Operating Partnership units into our common shares during 2007 and 2006. The decrease of $2,574,000 in preferred unit distributions of the Operating Partnership was due to the redemption of $45,000,000 Series D-9 preferred units and the write-off of $1,125,000 of Series D-9 issuance costs in October 2006.

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarter-by-quarter net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys' fourth quarter net income, which we recorded on a one-quarter lag basis in our first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. The Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year. The Merchandise Mart segment also has experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage rental income.

Related Party Transactions
Loans and Compensation Agreements
 
On March 26, 2007, Joseph Macnow, Executive Vice President  Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer, repaid to the Company his $2,000,000 outstanding loan which was scheduled to mature June 2007.
 
Effective as of April 19, 2007, we entered into a new employment agreement with Mitchell Schear, the President of our Washington, DC Office segment. This agreement, which replaced his prior agreement, was approved by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Trustees and provides for a term of five years and is automatically renewable for one-year terms thereafter. The agreement also provides for a minimum salary of $1,000,000 per year and bonuses and other customary benefits. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on April 19, 2007, the Compensation Committee granted options to Mr. Schear to acquire 200,000 of our common shares at an exercise price of $119.94 per share. These options vest ratably over three years beginning in 2010 and accelerate on a change of control or if we terminate his employment without cause or by him for breach by us. The agreement also provides that if we terminate Mr. Schear's employment without cause or by him for breach by us, he will receive a lump-sum payment equal to one year's salary and bonus, up to a maximum of $2,000,000.
 
 
Transactions with Affiliates and Officers and Trustees
 
Alexander's
 
We own 32.5% of Alexander's. Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Michael D. Fascitelli, our President, are officers and directors of Alexander's. We provide various services to Alexander's in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements. These agreements are described in Note 6 - Investments in Partially Owned Entities to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
On September 9, 2008, Alexander's Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $7.00 per share, payable on October 30, 2008, to shareholders of record on October 14, 2008. The dividend was attributable to the liquidation of the wholly owned 731 Lexington Avenue taxable REIT subsidiary into Alexander's. Accordingly, on October 30, we received $11,578,000, which was accounted for as a reduction of our investment in Alexander's.
 
On September 15, 2008 and October 14, 2008, Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, who holds the same positions in Alexander's, exercised an aggregate of 200,000 of his SARs, which were scheduled to expire on March 4, 2009, and received gross proceeds of $62,809,000.
 
On March 13, 2007, Michael Fascitelli, our President, who also holds the same position in Alexander's, exercised 350,000 of his SARs, which were scheduled to expire on March 14, 2007, and he received gross proceeds of $50,465,000.
 
Interstate Properties ("Interstate")
 
Interstate is a general partnership in which Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board and Chief Executive Officer, is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander's, are Interstate's two other partners. As of December 31, 2008, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned approximately 8.8% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 27.0% of Alexander's common stock.
 
We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days' notice at the end of the term. We believe based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies that the management agreement terms are fair to us. We earned $803,000, $800,000 and $798,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations, cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, cash dividends to shareholders, debt amortization and recurring capital expenditures. Capital requirements for significant acquisitions and development expenditures may require funding from borrowings and/or equity offerings.
 
Acquisitions and Investments
 
There were no material real estate acquisitions or investments in partially owned entities and mezzanine loans during 2008. During 2007, we completed approximately $4,045,400,000 of real estate acquisitions and $217,081,000 mezzanine loans. These acquisitions and investments were consummated through our subsidiaries and were financed with available cash, mortgage indebtedness, and/or the issuance of operating partnership equity. The related assets, liabilities and results of operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Excluding our acquisition of a 70% interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas and 555 California Street in May 2007, none of the acquisitions, individually or in the aggregate, were material to our historical consolidated financial statements. Details of our 2007 acquisitions and investments are summarized below.

H Street Building Corporation ("H Street")
 
In July 2005, we acquired H Street, which owns a 50% interest in real estate assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia and Washington, DC. On April 30, 2007, we acquired the corporations that own the remaining 50% interest in these assets for approximately $383,000,000, consisting of $322,000,000 in cash and $61,000,000 of existing mortgages. These assets include twin office buildings located in Washington, DC, containing 577,000 square feet, and assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia, comprised of 34 acres of land leased to three residential and retail operators, a 1,680 unit high-rise apartment complex and 10 acres of vacant land.
 
Further, we agreed to sell approximately 19.6 of the 34 acres of land to one of the existing ground lessees in two closings over a two-year period for approximately $220,000,000. On May 11, 2007, we closed on the sale of 11 of the 19.6 acres for $104,000,000 and received $5,000,000 in cash and a $99,000,000 short-term note. On September 28, 2007, the buyer pre-paid the note in cash and we recognized a net gain of $4,803,000.

The purchase price for our 70% interest in the real estate was approximately $1.8 billion, consisting of $1.0 billion of cash and $797,000,000 of existing debt. Our share of the debt was comprised of $308,000,000 secured by 1290 Avenue of the Americas and $489,000,000 secured by 555 California Street. Our 70% interest was acquired through the purchase of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies that own, through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership interest and a 69% limited partnership interest in the partnerships that own the two properties. The remaining 30% limited partnership interest is owned by Donald J. Trump.

Shopping Center Portfolio Acquisition
 
On June 26, 2007, we entered into an agreement to acquire a portfolio of 15 shopping centers aggregating approximately 1.9 million square feet for an aggregate purchase price of $351,000,000. The properties are located primarily in Northern New Jersey and Long Island, New York. We have completed the acquisition of nine of these properties for an aggregate purchase price of $250,478,000, consisting of $109,279,000 in cash, $49,599,000 in Vornado Realty L.P. preferred units, $12,460,000 of Vornado Realty L.P. common units and $79,140,000 of existing mortgage debt. We determined not to complete the acquisition of the remaining six properties and expensed $2,700,000 for costs of acquisitions not consummated on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007.
 
BNA Complex
 
On August 9, 2007, we acquired a three building complex from The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc. ("BNA") for $111,000,000 in cash. The complex contains approximately 300,000 square feet and is located in Washington's West End between Georgetown and the Central Business District. We plan to convert two of these buildings to rental apartments. Simultaneously with the acquisition, we sold Crystal Mall Two, a 277,000 square foot office building located at 1801 South Bell Street in Crystal City, to BNA for $103,600,000 in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $19,893,000.

Certain Future Cash Requirements
 
Development and Redevelopment Expenditures
 
We are currently engaged in various development and redevelopment projects for which we have budgeted approximately $1.2 billion, of which $804.9 million has been expended as of December 31, 2008 and substantially all of the remainder is anticipated to be expended in 2009. Details of our development and redevelopment activities are summarized in Item 1. Business, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Other Capital Expenditures
 
The following table summarizes other anticipated 2009 capital expenditures.
 
____________________________
 
The table above excludes anticipated capital expenditures of non-consolidated entities, including Alexander's and Toys, as these entities will fund their own capital expenditures without additional equity contributions from us.
 
Dividends and Distributions
 
On January 14, 2009, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.95 per common share, payable on March 12, 2009 in a combination of cash, not to exceed 40% in the aggregate, and Vornado common shares. This dividend policy, continued for all of 2009, will require approximately $260,000,000 of cash for common share dividends during 2009, assuming shareholder elections to receive cash meet or exceed the aggregate cash limitations. In addition, we expect to pay cash dividends on outstanding preferred shares during 2009 aggregating approximately $57,000,000.

Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations
 
Below is a schedule of our contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008.
 
________________________
 
 
We may from time to time purchase or retire outstanding debt securities though cash purchases and/or exchanges for our equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such purchases and/or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors. The amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
 
We believe that we have complied with the financial covenants required by our revolving credit facilities and our senior unsecured notes, and that as of December 31, 2008 we have the ability to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness. We have an effective shelf registration for the offering of our equity securities and debt securities that is not limited in amount due to our status as a "well-known seasoned issuer."
 
Our credit facilities contain financial covenants, that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.

Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations  continued
 
During 2008, we purchased an aggregate of $109,040,000 of our senior unsecured notes and convertible senior debentures, for $98,488,000 in cash. In addition, we completed approximately $1.3 billion of property level mortgage financings and repaid $241,000,000 of existing debt. During 2007, we completed approximately $1.4 billion of senior unsecured financings and $1.111 billion of property level mortgage financings and repaid $912,674,000 of existing debt. The net proceeds we received from 2008 and 2007 financings were used primarily for general corporate purposes and to fund acquisitions and investments unless otherwise noted. Details of our 2008 financing activities are summarized in the Overview of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Details of our 2007 financing activities are summarized below.
 
2.85% Convertible Senior Debentures due 2027
 
On March 21, 2007, we sold $1.4 billion aggregate face amount of 2.85% convertible senior debentures due 2027, pursuant to an effective registration statement. The aggregate net proceeds from this offering, after underwriters' discounts and expenses, were approximately $1.37 billion. The debentures are redeemable at our option beginning in 2012 for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase their debentures in 2012, 2017, and 2022 and in certain other limited circumstances. The debentures are convertible, under certain circumstances, for cash and Vornado common shares at an initial conversion rate of 6.1553 common shares per $1,000 of principal amount of debentures. The initial conversion price was $162.46, which represented a premium of 30% over the March 21, 2007 closing price for our common shares. The principal amount of debentures will be settled for cash and the amount in excess of the principal defined as the conversion value will be settled in cash or, at our election, Vornado common shares.
 
The net proceeds of the offering were contributed to the Operating Partnership in the form of an inter-company loan and the Operating Partnership guaranteed the payment of the debentures.
 
Revolving Credit Facility
 
On September 28, 2007, the Operating Partnership entered into a new $1.510 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which was increased by $85,000,000 on October 12, 2007 and can be increased to up to $2.0 billion during the initial term. The new facility has a three-year term with two one-year extension options, bears interest at LIBOR plus 55 basis points, based on our current credit ratings and requires the payment of an annual facility fee of 15 basis points. Together with the existing $0.965 billion credit facility, the Operating Partnership has an aggregate of $2.56 billion of unsecured revolving credit. Vornado is the guarantor of the Operating Partnership's obligations under both revolving credit agreements. The existing $0.965 billion credit facility's financial covenants were modified to conform to the financial covenants under the new agreement. Significant modifications included (i) changing the definition of Capitalization Value to exclude corporate unallocated general and administrative expenses and to reducing the capitalization rate to 6.5% from 7.5%, and (ii) changing the definition of Total Outstanding Indebtedness to exclude indebtedness of unconsolidated joint ventures. Under the new agreement, "Equity Value" may not be less than Three Billion Dollars; "Total Outstanding Indebtedness" may not exceed sixty percent (60%) of "Capitalization Value;" the ratio of "Combined EBITDA" to "Fixed Charges," each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not be less than 1.40 to 1.00; the ratio of "Unencumbered Combined EBITDA" to "Unsecured Interest Expense," each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not be less than 1.50 to 1.00; at any time, "Unsecured Indebtedness" may not exceed sixty percent (60%) of "Capitalization Value of Unencumbered Assets;" and the ratio of "Secured Indebtedness" to "Capitalization Value," each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not exceed fifty percent (50%). The new agreement also contains standard representations and warranties and other covenants. The terms in quotations in this paragraph are all defined in the new agreement, which was filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K dated September 28, 2007, filed on October 4, 2007.

Insurance
 
We carry commercial liability and all risk property insurance ((i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended coverage, (iv) "acts of terrorism" as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 ("TRIPRA") , which expires in December 2014, and (v) rental loss insurance) with respect to our assets. Our New York Office, Washington, DC Office, Retail and Merchandise Mart divisions have $2.0 billion of per occurrence all risk property insurance coverage, including terrorism coverage in effect through September 15, 2009. Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $150,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property, and a $150,000,000 annual aggregate.
 
In June 2007 we formed Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC ("PPIC"), a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, to act as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage and as a direct insurer for coverage for "certified" acts of terrorism and for nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological ("NBCR") acts, as defined by TRIPRA. Coverage for "certified" acts of terrorism is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. Prior to the formation of PPIC, we were uninsured for NBCR losses. Subsequently, we have $2.0 billion of NBCR coverage under TRIPRA, for which PPIC is responsible for 15% of each NBCR loss and the insurance company deductible of $1,000,000. We are ultimately responsible for any loss borne by PPIC.
 
We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years.
 
Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties (which are generally non-recourse to us), senior unsecured notes, exchangeable senior debentures, convertible senior debentures and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance and/or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio.
 
Other Commitments and Contingencies
 
Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us.
 
We are committed to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating approximately $213,352,000. Of this amount, $80,923,000 is committed to IPF and is pledged as collateral to IPF's lender.
 
From time to time, we have disposed of substantial amounts of real estate to third parties for which, as to certain properties, we remain contingently liable for rent payments or mortgage indebtedness that we cannot quantify.

Litigation
 
We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters, including the matters referred to below, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 
On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey ("USDC-NJ") claiming that we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect the $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, because of the expiration of the East Brunswick, Jersey City, Middletown, Union and Woodbridge leases to which the $5,000,000 of additional rent was previously allocated. Stop & Shop asserted that a prior order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York dated February 6, 2001, as modified on appeal to the District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 13, 2001, froze our right to re-allocate which effectively terminated our right to collect the additional rent from Stop & Shop. On March 3, 2003, after we moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, Stop & Shop voluntarily withdrew its complaint. On March 26, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a new complaint in New York Supreme Court, asserting substantially the same claims as in its USDC-NJ complaint. We removed the action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In January 2005 that court remanded the action to the New York Supreme Court. On February 14, 2005, we served an answer in which we asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all the unpaid additional rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration that Stop & Shop will continue to be liable for the additional rent as long as any of the leases subject to the Master Agreement and Guaranty remain in effect. On May 17, 2005, we filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 15, 2005, Stop & Shop opposed our motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denying the motions for summary judgment. Both parties appealed the Court's decision and on December 14, 2006, the Appellate Court division issued a decision affirming the Court's decision. On January 16, 2007, we filed a motion for the reconsideration of one aspect of the Appellate Court's decision which was denied on March 13, 2007. We are currently engaged in discovery and anticipate that a trial date will be set for some time in 2009. We intend to vigorously pursue our claims against Stop & Shop. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
 
On May 24, 2007, we acquired a 70% controlling interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas and the 555 California Street complex. Our 70% interest was acquired through the purchase of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies that own, through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership interest and a 69% limited partnership interest in the partnerships that own the two properties. The remaining 30% limited partnership interest is owned by Donald J. Trump. In August 2005, Mr. Trump brought a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court against, among others, the general partners of the partnerships referred to above.   Mr. Trump's claims arose out of a dispute over the sale price of and use of proceeds from, the sale of properties located on the former Penn Central rail yards between West 59th and 72nd Streets in Manhattan which were formerly owned by the partnerships. In decisions dated September 14, 2005 and July 24, 2006, the Court denied several of Mr. Trump's motions and ultimately dismissed all of Mr. Trump's claims, except for his claim seeking access to books and records. In a decision dated October 1, 2007, the Court determined that Mr. Trump had already received access to the books and records to which he was entitled, with the exception of certain documents which were subsequently delivered to Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump sought re-argument and renewal on, and filed a notice of appeal in connection with, his dismissed claims.  In a decision dated January 6, 2009, the Court denied all of Mr. Trump's motions. Mr. Trump has filed a notice appealing the 2007 and 2009 decisions. In connection with the acquisition, we agreed to indemnify the sellers for liabilities and expenses arising out of Mr. Trump's claim that the general partners of the partnerships we acquired did not sell the rail yards at a fair price or could have sold the rail yards for a greater price and any other claims asserted in the legal action; provided however, that if Mr. Trump prevails on certain claims involving partnership matters, other than claims relating to sale price, the sellers will be required to reimburse us for certain costs related to those claims. We believe that the claims relating to the sale price are without merit. All other allegations are not asserted as a basis for damages and regardless of merit, in our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.
 
In July 2005, we acquired H Street Building Corporation ("H Street") which has a subsidiary that owns, among other things, a 50% tenancy in common interest in land located in Arlington County, Virginia, known as "Pentagon Row," leased to two tenants. In April 2007, H Street acquired the remaining 50% interest in that fee. In April 2007, we received letters from those tenants, Street Retail, Inc. and Post Apartment Homes, L.P., claiming they had a right of first offer triggered by each of those transactions. On September 25, 2008, both tenants filed suit against us and the former owners. The claim alleges the right to purchase the fee interest, damages in excess of $75,000,000 and punitive damages. We believe this claim is without merit and in our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operation or cash flow.

Cash Flow for the Year Ended December 31, 2008
 
Property rental income is our primary source of cash flow and is dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our properties.

Funds From Operations ("FFO")
FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus specified non-cash items, such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity REITs. FFO and FFO per diluted share should be evaluated along with GAAP net income and income per diluted share (the most directly comparable GAAP measures), as well as cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, in evaluating the operating performance of equity REITs. Management believes that FFO and FFO per diluted share are helpful to investors as supplemental performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, these non-GAAP measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in Our Statements of Cash Flows. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. The calculations of both the numerator and denominator used in the computation of income per share are disclosed in Note 18. Income per Share, in our notes to consolidated financial statements on page 114 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions was $813,064,000, or $4.80 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $943,205,000 or $5.55 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2007. FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions was a negative $88,154,000 or $0.55 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2008 compared to $186,210,000, or $1.10 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2007.

We have exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates. Market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control. Our exposure to a change in interest rates on our consolidated and non-consolidated debt (all of which arises out of non-trading activity) is as follows:
 
 
We may utilize various financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies, depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. As of December 31, 2008, variable rate debt with an aggregate principal amount of $462,000,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.75% was subject to LIBOR caps. These caps are based on a notional amount of $462,000,000 and cap LIBOR at a weighted average rate of 5.93%.
 
As of December 31, 2008, we have investments in mezzanine loans with an aggregate carrying amount of $99,011,000 that are based on variable interest rates which partially mitigate our exposure to a change in interest rates on our variable rate debt.
 
Fair Value of Our Debt
 
The estimated fair value of our debt at December 31, 2008 was less than its aggregate carrying amount by approximately $1,040,386,000 based on current market prices and discounted cash flows at the current rate at which we believe similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt.
 
Derivative Instruments
 
We have, and may in the future enter into, derivative positions that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Because these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from their mark-to-market at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in "interest and other investment income" on our consolidated statements of income. In addition, we are, and may in the future be, subject to additional expense based on the notional amount of the derivative positions and a specified spread over LIBOR. Because the market value of these instruments can vary significantly between periods, we may experience significant fluctuations in the amount of our investment income or expense. In 2008, we recognized a net loss of $33,740,000 and in 2007 and 2006 we recognized net gains aggregating approximately $113,503,000 and $153,208,000, respectively, from these positions.

Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vornado Realty Trust and its majority-owned subsidiary, Vornado Realty L.P. All significant inter-company amounts have been eliminated. We account for unconsolidated partially owned entities on the equity method of accounting. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
 
Impact of Retrospective Application of New Accounting Pronouncements
On January 1, 2009, we adopted (i) FASB Staff Position APB 14-1,
Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that may be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)
("FSP 14-1"), (ii) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160,

, and (iii) FASB Staff Position EITF 03-6-1,
Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities ("EITF 03-6-1")
. These pronouncements were required to be applied retrospectively; accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the effects of the retrospective application of these pronouncements. The tables below summarize the impact of the adoption of these pronouncements on our previously issued consolidated balance sheets and statements of income and adjusts retroactively to the earliest period presented, the income per share amounts for additional common shares outstanding as a result of the stock portion of our common dividends during 2009.

Significant Accounting Policies
Real Estate:
Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Betterments, major renewals and certain costs directly related to the acquisition, improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. For redevelopment of existing operating properties, the net book value of the existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for the construction and improvements incurred in connection with the redevelopment are capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the property do not exceed the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property when complete. If the cost of the redeveloped property, including the undepreciated net book value of the property carried forward, exceeds the estimated fair value of redeveloped property, the excess is charged to expense. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the assets' estimated useful lives which range from 7 to 40 years. Tenant allowances are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which approximate the useful lives of the assets. Additions to real estate include interest expense capitalized during construction of $63,063,000 and $53,648,000, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
 
Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, and identified intangibles such as above and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases and customer relationships) and acquired liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") 141,
Business Combinations
and SFAS 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
, and we allocate purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property.
 
Our properties, including any related intangible assets, are individually reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over our anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property's carrying amount over its estimated fair value. Our impairment analysis is based on our plans for the asset and the market information available to our management at the time the analysis is prepared. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, our anticipated holding period for properties, or the estimated fair value of properties change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment charges may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses. In the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized an aggregate of $78,069,000 of non-cash impairment charges on our wholly owned real estate assets related to certain development projects. No impairment charges were recognized in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Partially Owned Entities:
In determining whether we have a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which we will absorb the majority of the entity's expected losses, if they occur, or receive the majority of the expected residual returns, if they occur, or both. We have concluded that we do not control a partially owned entity, despite an ownership interest of 50% or greater, if the entity is not considered a variable interest entity and the approval of all of the partners/members is contractually required with respect to major decisions, such as operating and capital budgets, the sale, exchange or other disposition of real property, the hiring of a chief executive officer, the commencement, compromise or settlement of any lawsuit, legal proceeding or arbitration or the placement of new or additional financing secured by assets of the venture. This is the case with respect to our 50% interests in Monmouth Mall, MartParc Wells, MartParc Orleans, 478-486 Broadway, 968 Third Avenue, West 57 Street properties and 825 Seventh Avenue. We account for investments on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of investees' net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions made during the year. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method.
th
 
Our investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary. In the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized $203,919,000 of non-cash impairment charges related to investments in partially owned entities, of which $107,882,000 represents our investment in Lexington Realty Trust and the remainder represents our share of certain ventures' development costs. No impairment charges were recognized in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.
 
Identified Intangibles:
We record acquired intangible assets (including above-market leases, customer relationships and in-place leases) and acquired intangible liabilities (including belowmarket leases) at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill. We amortize identified intangible assets and liabilities that are determined to have finite lives over the period the assets and liabilities are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value.
 
As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets, a component of "other assets" on our consolidated balance sheets, were $525,950,000 and $563,359,000, respectively. In addition, the carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities, a component of "deferred credit" on our consolidated balance sheets, were $719,822,000 and $814,098,000, respectively.
 
Mezzanine Loans Receivable:
We invest in mezzanine loans to entities which have significant real estate assets. These investments, which are subordinate to the mortgage loans secured by the real property, are generally secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate. We record these investments at the stated principal amount net of any unamortized discount or premium. We accrete or amortize any discounts or premiums over the life of the related loan receivable utilizing the effective interest method, or straight-line method if the result is not materially different. We evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of our loans, if circumstances warrant, to determine whether they are impaired. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the estimated fair value of the loan or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. In the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized a $57,000,000 non-cash impairment charge on one of our mezzanine loans. Upon sale of a sub-participation in that loan during 2008, we reversed $10,300,000 of the charge recognized in 2007.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:
Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents do not include cash escrowed under loan agreements and cash restricted in connection with an officer's deferred compensation payable. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks which may at times exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit. We have not experienced any losses to date on our invested cash.
 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:
We periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents. This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had $32,834,000 and $19,151,000, respectively, in allowances for doubtful accounts. In addition, as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had $5,773,000 and $3,076,000, respectively, in allowances for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents.
 
Marketable Securities:
We classify debt and equity securities which we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time as securities available-for-sale; equity securities we intend to buy and sell on a short term basis as trading securities; and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock investments which we intend to hold to maturity as securities heldtomaturity. Unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale are included as a component of shareholders' equity and other comprehensive income. Realized gains or losses on the sale of securities are recorded based on the weighted average cost of such securities.
 
We evaluate our portfolio of marketable securities for impairment as of each reporting period. For each of the securities in our portfolio with unrealized losses, we review the underlying cause of the decline in value and the estimated recovery period, as well as the severity and duration of the decline. In our evaluation, we consider our ability and intent to hold these investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for us to recover our cost basis. We also evaluate the near-term prospects for each of these investments in relation to the severity and duration of the decline. In the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized an aggregate of $76,352,000 of non-cash impairment charges related to investments in marketable securities, which is included as a component of "interest and other investment (loss) income, net" on our consolidated statement of income. Our conclusions were based on the severity and duration of the decline in the market value ("fair value" pursuant to SFAS 157) of these securities and our inability to forecast a recovery in the near term. No impairment charges were recognized in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.
 
At December 31, 2008 and 2007, our marketable equity securities had an aggregate carrying amount of $120,499,000 and $215,134,000, and an aggregate fair value of $118,438,000 and $226,682,000, respectively. Accordingly, net unrealized (losses) gains were ($2,061,000) and $11,548,000 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, our held-to-maturity securities had an aggregate carrying amount of $215,884,000 and $96,310,000, and an aggregate fair value of $164,728,000 and $96,310,000, respectively.
 
Deferred Charges:
Direct financing costs are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related agreements as a component of interest expense. Direct costs related to successful leasing activities are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases. All other deferred charges are amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method, in accordance with the terms of the agreements to which they relate.
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
We have estimated the fair value of all financial instruments reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at amounts which are based upon an interpretation of available market information and valuation methodologies (including discounted cash flow analyses with regard to mezzanine loans and debt). While we chose not to elect the fair value option prescribed by Statement No.159,
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities
("SFAS 159"), for our financial assets and liabilities that had not been previously measured at fair value, the aggregate fair value of our mezzanine loans receivable was less than its aggregate carrying amount by approximately $55,452,000 as of December 31, 2008 and approximated its carrying amount at December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the estimated fair value of our consolidated debt was less than its carrying amount by approximately $1,040,386,000. As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of our consolidated debt exceeded its carrying amount by approximately $226,833,000. Such fair value estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized upon disposition of our financial instruments.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities:
SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
("SFAS 133"), as amended and interpreted, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. As required by SFAS 133, we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
 
For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (loss) (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings. We assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction. For derivatives not designated as hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.

Income Taxes:
We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. We distribute to shareholders 100% of taxable income and therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. Dividend distributions for the year ended December 31, 2008 were characterized, for Federal income tax purposes, as 70.81% ordinary income and 29.19% return of capital. Dividend distributions for the year ended December 31, 2007 were characterized, for Federal income tax purposes, as 61.6% ordinary income and 38.4% long-term capital gain income. Dividend distributions for the year ended December 31, 2006 were characterized, for Federal income tax purposes, as 29.0% ordinary income, 14.8% long-term capital gain income and 56.2% return of capital.
 
We have elected to treat certain consolidated subsidiaries, and may in the future elect to treat newly formed subsidiaries, as taxable REIT subsidiaries pursuant to an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code that became effective January 1, 2001. Taxable REIT subsidiaries may participate in non-real estate related activities and/or perform non-customary services for tenants and are subject to Federal and State income tax at regular corporate tax rates. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries had a combined current income tax liability of approximately $21,357,000 and $15,361,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and have immaterial differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities.
 
In connection with purchase accounting for H Street, in July 2005 and April 2007 we recorded an aggregate of $222,174,000 of deferred tax liabilities representing the differences between the tax basis and the book basis of the acquired assets and liabilities multiplied by the effective tax rate. We were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of January 16, 2008, we had completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, in the first quarter of 2008, we reversed the deferred tax liabilities and recognized an income tax benefit of $222,174,000 in our consolidated statement of income.
 
The following table reconciles net income attributable to common shareholders to estimated taxable income for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.
 
The net basis of our assets and liabilities for tax reporting purposes is approximately $3.4 billion lower than the amount reported in our consolidated financial statements.

Income Per Share:
Basic income per share is computed based on weighted average shares outstanding. Diluted income per share considers the effect of all potentially dilutive share equivalents, including outstanding employee stock options, restricted shares, warrants and convertible or redeemable securities.
 
Stock-Based Compensation:
Stock-based compensation consists of awards to certain employees and officers and consists of stock options, restricted stock, restricted Operating Partnership units and out-performance plan awards. The terms of each of these awards are described in Note 11. Stock-Based Compensation. We account for all stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123R,
Share-Based Payment
("SFAS 123R").
 
Stock option
awards
 
We determine the value of stock option awards, using a binomial valuation model and appropriate market assumptions adjusted to include an estimated forfeiture factor which is based on our past history. Compensation expense for stock option awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally five years.
 
Restricted stock and Operating Partnership unit
awards
 
Restricted stock awards are valued using the average of the high and low market price of our common shares on the NYSE on the date of grant, adjusted to include an estimated forfeiture factor which is based on our past history. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally three to five years. Dividends paid on unvested shares are charged to retained earnings. Dividends on shares that are cancelled or terminated prior to vesting are charged to compensation expense in the period they are cancelled or terminated.
 
Restricted Operating Partnership unit awards are also valued using the average of the high and low market price of our common shares on the NYSE on the date of grant, adjusted to include an estimated forfeiture factor which is based on history. Compensation expense is recognized over the five year vesting period using a graded vesting attribution model as these awards are subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition. Dividends paid on unvested units are charged to "net income attributable to noncontrolling interests" expense on our consolidated statements of operations. Dividends on units that are cancelled or terminated prior to the satisfaction of the performance condition and vesting are charged to compensation expense in the period they are cancelled or terminated.
 
Out-performance plan
awards
 
Out-performance plan awards are valued using a risk-free valuation model and appropriate market assumptions as of the date of grant, adjusted to include an estimated forfeiture factor which is based on our past history. Compensation expense is recognized over five years using a graded vesting attribution model as these awards are subject to the satisfaction of certain market and performance conditions, in addition to vesting.

Recently Issued Accounting Literature
 
In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement No. 157,
Fair Value Measurements
("SFAS 157").
SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 was effective for our financial assets and liabilities on January 1, 2008.  The FASB has deferred the implementation of the provisions of SFAS 157 relating to certain non-financial assets and liabilities until January 1, 2009. This standard did not materially affect how we determine fair value, but resulted in certain additional disclosures. SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three levels: Level 1  quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities; Level 2  observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data; and Level 3  unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value. Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in our consolidated financial statements primarily consist of (i) marketable securities, (ii) the assets of our deferred compensation plan (primarily marketable securities and equity investments in limited partnerships), for which there is a corresponding liability on our consolidated balance sheets and (iii) Class A units of the Operating Partnership, held by third-parties. Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of December 31, 2008 are presented in the table below based on their level in the fair value hierarchy.
 
___________________
 
The fair value of Level 3 "deferred compensation plan assets" represents equity investments in certain limited partnerships, for which there is a corresponding Level 3 liability to the plan's participants. The following is a summary of changes in Level 3 deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities, for the year ended December 31, 2008.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159, which permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.  SFAS 159 was effective on January 1, 2008. We did not elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial instruments on the effective date and have not determined whether we will elect this option for any eligible financial instruments we acquire in the future.
 
In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141R,
Business Combinations
("SFAS 141R"). SFAS 141R broadens the guidance of SFAS 141, extending its applicability to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses. SFAS 141R also broadens the fair value measurement and recognition of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and interests transferred as a result of business combinations; and acquisition related costs will generally be expensed rather than included as part of the basis of the acquisition. SFAS 141R expands required disclosures to improve the ability to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations. SFAS 141R is effective for all transactions entered into on or after January 1, 2009. The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2009 could materially impact future financial results to the extent that we acquire significant amounts of real estate, in part because acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred compared to our current practice of capitalizing such costs and amortizing them over the estimated useful life of the assets acquired.
 
In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160,
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - An Amendment of ARB No. 51
("SFAS 160"). SFAS 160 requires a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to be reported as equity and the amount of consolidated net income specifically attributable to the noncontrolling interest to be identified in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 also calls for consistency in the manner of reporting changes in the parent's ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation. As of December 31, 2008, as part of our preparation for the adoption of SFAS 160, which is effective for us on January 1, 2009, we have retroactively adopted the measurement provisions of EITF Topic D-98,
Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities
. Upon adoption, we adjusted the carrying amounts of the Class A units held by third parties, a component of "redeemable noncontrolling interests" on our consolidated balance sheets, by recognizing a $639,447,000 increase to the January 1, 2006 balance of "redeemable noncontrolling interests" and a corresponding decrease in "earnings in excess of (less than) distributions," which was accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment on January 1, 2006. Subsequent adjustments to the carrying amounts of the Class A units, to reflect the change in their redemption value at the end of each reporting period, were recorded to "additional capital." The effects of retrospectively applying SFAS 160, resulted in (i) the reclassification of minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries to noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, a component of permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheets, (ii) the reclassification of minority interest expense to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, on our consolidated statements of income, and (iii) additional disclosures, including a consolidated statement of changes in equity in quarterly reporting periods.
 
In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161,
Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133
("SFAS 161")
.
SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures related to derivative instruments and hedging activities, including disclosures regarding how an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133
,
and the impact of derivative instruments and related hedged items on an entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective on January 1, 2009. We believe that the adoption of this standard on January 1, 2009 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

On January 1, 2009, we adopted FASB Staff Position APB 14-1,
Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that may be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)
("FSP 14-1"), which was required to be applied retrospectively. The adoption of FSP 14-1 affected the accounting for our convertible and exchangeable senior debentures by requiring the initial proceeds from their sale to be allocated between a debt component and an equity component in a manner that results in interest expense on the debt component at our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate on the date of issue. The initial debt components of our $1.4 billion Convertible Senior Debentures, $1 billion Convertible Senior Debentures and $500 million Exchangeable Senior Debentures were $1,241,286,000, $926,361,000 and $457,699,000, respectively, based on the fair value of similar nonconvertible instruments issued at that time. The aggregate initial debt discount of $216,655,000 after original issuance costs allocated to the equity component was recorded in "additional capital" in our consolidated statements of changes in equity. We are amortizing the discount using the effective interest method over the period the debt is expected to remain outstanding (i.e., the earliest date the holders may require us to repurchase the debentures), as additional interest expense. Accordingly, interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 has been adjusted to include $39,546,000, 30,418,000 and $5,969,000 of amortization in the aggregate, or $35,746,000, $27,367,000 and $5,358,000, net of amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests. Amortization for periods prior to December 31, 2005 (not presented herein) aggregating $2,724,000 have been reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in "earnings in excess (less than) distributions" on our consolidated statements of changes in equity. Below is a summary of the financial statement effects of implementing FSP 14-1 and related disclosures.

In May 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 163,
Accounting for Financial Guarantee Insurance Contracts
("SFAS 163").
SFAS 163
was issued to decrease inconsistencies within Statement No. 60,
Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises
, and clarify how it applies to financial guarantee insurance contracts issued by insurance enterprises, including the recognition of premium revenue and claim liabilities. SFAS 163 also requires expanded disclosures about financial guarantee insurance contracts. SFAS 163 is effective on January 1, 2009. We believe that the adoption of this standard on January 1, 2009 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
 
In June 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue 07-5,
Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity's Own Stock
("EITF 07-5"). Paragraph 11(a) of SFAS 133 specifies that a contract that would otherwise meet the definition of a derivative but is both (a) indexed to the company's own stock and (b) classified in stockholders' equity in the statement of financial position would not be considered a derivative financial instrument. EITF 07-5 provides a new two-step model to be applied in determining whether a financial instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an issuer's own stock and thus able to qualify for the SFAS 133 paragraph 11(a) scope exception. EITF 07-5 is effective on January 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.
 
In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF 03-6-1,
Determining Whether Investments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities
("FSP 03-6-1"). FSP 03-6-1 requires companies to treat unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents as "participating securities" and include such securities in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method as described in SFAS 128. FSP 03-6-1 became effective on January 1, 2009 and required all prior period earnings per share data presented, to be adjusted retroactively. The adoption of FSP 03-6-1 on January 1, 2009 did not have a material effect on our computation of income per share.

The purchase price for our 70% interest in the real estate was approximately $1.8 billion, consisting of $1.0 billion of cash and $797,000,000 of existing debt. Our share of the debt was comprised of $308,000,000 secured by 1290 Avenue of the Americas and $489,000,000 secured by 555 California Street. Our 70% interest was acquired through the purchase of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies that own, through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership interest and a 69% limited partnership interest in the partnerships that own the two properties. The remaining 30% limited partnership interest is owned by Donald J. Trump. The operations of 1290 Avenue of the Americas are included in the New York Office segment and the operations of 555 California Street are included in the Other segment.

H Street Building Corporation ("H Street")
 
In July 2005, we acquired H Street, which owns a 50% interest in real estate assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia and Washington, DC. On April 30, 2007, we acquired the corporations that own the remaining 50% interest in these assets for approximately $383,000,000, consisting of $322,000,000 in cash and $61,000,000 of existing mortgages.

Investment in McDonald's Corporation ("McDonalds") (NYSE: MCD)
 
We owned an economic interest in 14,565,500 McDonalds' common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which we purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on McDonalds' common shares. These call and put options had an initial weighted-average strike price of $32.66 per share, or an aggregate of $475,692,000 and provided for net cash settlement. Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options increased at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points and was decreased for dividends received. The options provided us with the same economic gain or loss as if we had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate purchase price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. Because these options were derivatives and did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the options at the end of each reporting period were recognized as "interest and other investment income, net" on our consolidated statements of income. During 2006, we sold 2,119,500 of these shares at a weighted average price of $35.49 per share, and acquired an additional 1,250,000 option shares at a weighted average price of $33.08 per share. During 2007, we settled the 13,695,500 remaining option shares and received an aggregate of $260,719,000 in cash. We recognized net gains of $108,821,000 and $138,815,000 in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing income from the mark-to-market of these shares during the period of our ownership through their settlement, net of related LIBOR charges.
 
In addition to the above, in October 2007, we sold 858,000 McDonald's common shares for aggregate proceeds of $48,434,000, or $56.45 per share, and recognized a net gain of $23,090,000, representing accumulated appreciation during the period of our ownership. The shares were acquired in 2005 at a weighted average price of $29.54 per share, and were classified as "available-for-sale" marketable equity securities on our consolidated balance sheet.
 
The aggregate net gain from inception of our investments in McDonalds in 2005 through final settlement in October 2007 was $289,414,000.
 
Investment in Sears, Roebuck and Co. ("Sears")
 
We owned an economic interest in 7,916,900 Sears' common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which we purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on Sears' common shares. These call and put options had an initial weighted-average strike price of $39.82 per share, or an aggregate of $315,250,000. Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options increased at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points and was decreased for dividends received. The options provided us with the same economic gain or loss as if we had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. Because these options were derivatives and did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market of the options at the end of each reporting period were recognized as "interest and other investment income, net" on our consolidated statements of income. On March 30, 2005, as a result of the merger between Sears and Kmart and pursuant to the terms of the contract, our derivative position representing 7,916,900 Sears common shares became a derivative position representing 2,491,819 common shares of Sears Holdings, Inc. ("Sears Holdings") (Nasdaq: SHLD) valued at $323,936,000 based on the then closing share price of $130.00 and $146,663,000 of cash. During 2005 we sold 402,660 of the option shares at a weighted average price of $124.44 per share. During 2006, we settled the remaining 2,089,159 option shares at a weighted average price of $125.43 per share, resulting in a net gain of $18,611,000. The aggregate net gain realized from inception of this investment in 2004 through settlement was $142,877,000.
 
Investment in Sears Canada, Inc. ("Sears Canada")
 
On April 3, 2006, we tendered the 7,500,000 Sears Canada shares we owned to Sears Holdings at the increased tender price of Cdn. $18.00 per share (the equivalent at that time of US $15.68 per share), which resulted in a net gain of $55,438,000, the difference between the tender price, and our carrying amount of $8.29 per share. Together with income recognized in the fourth quarter of 2005 that resulted from a Sears Canada special dividend, the aggregate net gain from inception in 2005 on our $143,737,000 investment was $78,323,000.

As of December 31, 2008, we own 32.7% of Toys. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys' fourth quarter net income accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. Because Toys' fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31, we record our 32.7% share of Toys' net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis.
 
In July 2008, in connection with an audit of Toys' purchase accounting basis financial statements for its fiscal years 2006 and 2007, it was determined that the purchase accounting basis income tax expense was understated. Our share of this non-cash charge was $14,900,000, which we recognized as part of our equity in Toys' net loss in the second quarter of 2008. This non-cash charge had no effect on cash actually paid for income taxes or Toys' previously issued Recap basis consolidated financial statements.
 
In 2006, Toys closed 87 Toys "R" Us stores in the United States as a result of its store-closing program. Toys incurred restructuring and other charges aggregating approximately $127,000,000 before tax, which includes $44,000,000 for the cost of liquidating the inventory. Our share of the $127,000,000 charge was $42,000,000, of which $27,300,000 had no income statement effect as a result of purchase accounting and the remaining portion relating to the cost of liquidating inventory of approximately $9,100,000 after-tax, was recognized as an expense as part of our equity in Toys' net income in 2006.
 
Below is a summary of Toys' latest available financial information presented on a purchase accounting basis:

Lexington Realty Trust ("Lexington") (NYSE: LXP)
On December 31, 2006, Newkirk Realty Trust (NYSE: NKT) was acquired in a merger by Lexington, a real estate investment trust that invests in, owns and manages commercial properties net leased to major corporations throughout the United States. We owned 10,186,991 Newkirk Master Limited Partnership ("Newkirk MLP") units (representing a 15.8% ownership interest), which was also acquired by Lexington as a subsidiary and was renamed Lexington Master Limited Partnership ("Lexington MLP"). The units in Newkirk MLP, which we accounted for on the equity method, were converted on a 0.80 for 1 basis into limited partnership units of Lexington MLP, which we also account for on the equity method. In addition, upon the merger, Newkirk terminated its advisory agreement with NKT Advisors, in which we had a 20.0% interest, for an aggregate payment of $12,500,000, of which our share was $2,300,000. On December 31, 2006, we recognized a net gain of $10,362,000, as a result of the merger transactions, which is included on a component of "(loss) income from partially owned entities" on our consolidated statement of income.
 
In connection with the above transactions, we owned 8,149,592 limited partnership units of Lexington MLP which were exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into Lexington common shares, or a 7.7% limited partnership interest. On October 28, 2008, we acquired 8,000,000 Lexington common shares for $5.60 per share, or $44,800,000. The purchase price consisted of $22,400,000 in cash and a $22,400,000 margin loan recourse only to the 8,000,000 shares acquired. In addition, we exchanged our existing limited partnership units in Lexington MLP for 8,149,592 Lexington common shares. As of December 31, 2008, we own 16,149,592 Lexington common shares, or approximately 17.2% of Lexington's common equity. We account for our investment in Lexington on the equity method and record our pro rata share of Lexington's net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis because we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q prior to the time that Lexington files its financial statements.
 
Based on Lexington's December 31, 2008 closing share price of $5.00, the market value ("fair value" pursuant to SFAS 157) of our investment in Lexington was $80,748,000, or $100,707,000 below the carrying amount on our consolidated balance sheet. We have concluded that our investment in Lexington is "other-than-temporarily" impaired and recorded a $100,707,000 non-cash impairment loss in the fourth quarter of 2008. Together with impairment changes recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2008, we recognized an aggregate of $107,882,000 of non-cash charges on our investment in Lexington. Our conclusions were based on the recent deterioration in the capital and financial markets and our inability to forecast a recovery in the near-term. These charges are included as a component of "(loss) income from partially owned entities," on our consolidated statement of income.
 
GMH
In June 2008, pursuant to the sale of GMH's military housing division and the merger of its student housing division with American Campus Communities, Inc. ("ACC") (NYSE: ACC), we received an aggregate of $105,180,000, consisting of $82,142,000 in cash and 753,126 shares of ACC common stock valued at $23,038,000 based on ACC's then closing share price of $30.59, in exchange for our entire interest in GMH. We subsequently sold all of the ACC common shares. The above transactions resulted in a net gain of $2,038,000 which is included as a component of "net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate" in our consolidated statement of income. The aggregate net income realized from inception of this investment in 2004 through its disposition was $77,000,000.
 
Real Estate Joint Ventures' Development Costs
 
During 2008, we recognized non-cash charges aggregating $96,037,000, for the write-off of our share of certain partially owned entities' development costs, as these projects were either deferred or abandoned. These charges include $37,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2008, for our 50% share of costs in connection with the redevelopment of the Filene's property in Boston, Massachusetts and $23,000,000 in the first quarter of 2008, for our 50% share of costs in connection with the abandonment of the "arena move"/Moynihan East portions of the Farley project. Such charges are included as a component of "(loss) income from partially owned entities," on our consolidated statement of income.

Our Share Option Plan (the "Plan") provides for grants of incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights and performance shares to certain employees and officers. We have approximately 2,400,000 shares available for future grant under the Plan at December 31, 2008.
 
In March 2006, our Board of Trustees (the "Board") approved an amendment to the Plan to permit the Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee") to grant awards in the form of limited partnership units ("OP Units") of the Operating Partnership. OP Units can be granted either as free-standing awards or in tandem with other awards under the Plan. OP Units may be converted into the Operating Partnership's Class A common units and, consequently, become convertible by the holder on a one-for-one basis for our common shares or the cash value of such shares at our election.
 
We account for all stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123R: Stock based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 consists of stock option awards, restricted stock and Operating Partnership unit awards and out-performance plan awards.
 
2006 Out-Performance Plan
 
In March 2006, the Board approved the terms of the Vornado Realty Trust 2006 Out-Performance Plan (the "2006 OPP"), a long-term "pay-for-performance" incentive compensation program. The purpose of the 2006 OPP was to further align the interests of our shareholders and management by encouraging our senior officers and employees to create shareholder value. On April 25, 2006, our Compensation Committee approved 2006 OPP awards to a total of 54 employees and officers of the Company, which aggregated 91% of the total 2006 OPP. The fair value of the awards on the date of grant, as adjusted for estimated forfeitures, was approximately $46,141,000 and is being amortized into expense over the five-year vesting period beginning on the date of grant, using a graded vesting attribution model.
 
Under the 2006 OPP, award recipients share in a performance pool when our total return to shareholders exceeds a cumulative 30% (for a period of 30 consecutive days), including both share appreciation and dividends paid, from a price per share of $89.17 (the average closing price per common share for the 30 trading days prior to March 15, 2006). The size of the pool is 10% of the amount in excess of the 30% benchmark, subject to a maximum cap of $100,000,000. Each award was designated as a specified percentage of the $100,000,000 maximum cap. Awards were issued in the form of a new class of Operating Partnership units ("OPP Units") and are subject to achieving the performance threshold, time vesting and other conditions. OPP Units are convertible by the holder into an equivalent number of the Operating Partnership's Class A units, which are redeemable by the holder for Vornado common shares on a one-for-one basis or the cash value of such shares, at our election. All awards earned vest 33.3% on each of March 15, 2009, 2010 and 2011 subject to continued employment. Once a performance pool has been established, each OPP Unit will receive a distribution equal to the distribution paid on a Class A unit, including an amount payable in OPP Units representing distributions paid on a Class A unit during the performance period. As of January 12, 2007, the maximum performance threshold under the Out-Performance Plan was achieved, concluding the performance period.

2008 Out-Performance Plan
 
On March 31, 2008, our Compensation Committee approved a $75,000,000 out-performance plan (the "2008 OPP") that requires the achievement of performance objectives against both absolute and relative thresholds. The 2008 OPP establishes a potential performance pool in which 78 members of senior management have the opportunity to share if the total return to our shareholders (the "Total Return") resulting from both share appreciation and dividends for the four-year period from March 31, 2008 to March 31, 2012 exceeds both an absolute and a relative hurdle. The initial value from which to determine the Total Return is $86.20 per share, a 0.93% premium to the trailing 10-day average closing price on the New York Stock Exchange for our common shares on the date the plan was adopted.
 
The size of the out-performance pool for the 2008 OPP is 6% of the aggregate "out-performance return" subject to a maximum total award of $75,000,000 (the "Maximum Award"). The "out-performance return" is comprised of (i) 3% of the total dollar value of the Total Return in excess of 10% per annum (the "Absolute Component"), plus (ii) 3% of the total dollar value of the Total Return in excess of the Relative Threshold (the "Relative Component"), based on the SNL Equity REIT Index (the "Index") over the four-year performance period. In the event that the Relative Component creates a negative award as a result of underperforming the Index, the value of any out-performance award potentially earned under the Absolute Component will be reduced dollar for dollar. In addition, awards potentially earned under the Relative Component will be reduced on a ratable sliding scale to the extent the Total Return is less than 10% per annum and to zero to the extent the Total Return is less than 7% per annum. The size of this out-performance pool, if any, will be determined based on the highest 30-trading day trailing average price of our common shares during the final 150 days of the four-year period. During the four-year performance period, participants are entitled to receive 10% of the common dividends paid on Vornado's common shares for each OPP unit awarded, regardless of whether the OPP units are ultimately earned.
 
The 2008 OPP also provides participants an opportunity to earn partial awards during two interim measurement periods (the "Interim Periods"): (a) one for a period consisting of the first two years of the performance period and (b) one for a period consisting of the final two years of the performance period. For each Interim Period, participants may be entitled to share in 40% ($30,000,000) of the maximum $75,000,000 performance pool if the performance thresholds have been met for the applicable Interim Periods on a pro rated basis. The starting share price for the first Interim Period is $86.20 per share. The starting share price for the second Interim Period is equal to the greater of our common share price on March 31, 2010, or the initial starting share price of $86.20 per share less dividends paid during the first two years of the plan. If the maximum award is earned during the first Interim Period, participants lose the potential to earn the second Interim Period award, but not the potential to earn the remainder of the maximum award over the four-year period. The size of any out-performance pool for an Interim Period will be determined based on the highest 30-day trailing average price of our shares during the final 120 days of the applicable Interim Period. Awards earned under the program (including any awards earned for the Interim Periods), will vest 50% on March 31, 2012 and 50% on March 31, 2013. The fair value of the OPP awards on the date of grant, as adjusted for estimated forfeitures, was approximately $21,600,000, and is being amortized into expense over a five-year period beginning on the date of grant through the final vesting period, using a graded vesting attribution model.
 
 
For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recognized $16,021,000, $12,734,000 and $8,293,000 of compensation expense, respectively, in connection with our 2006 and 2008 out-performance plans. The remaining unrecognized compensation expense of $29,551,000 will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years. Distributions paid on unvested OPP Units are charged to "net income attributable to noncontrolling interests" on our consolidated statements of income and amounted to $2,918,000, $2,694,000 and $0 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Stock Options
 
Stock options are granted at an exercise price equal to 100% of the average of the high and low market price of our common shares on the NYSE on the date of grant, generally vest pro-rata over five years and expire 10 years from the date of grant. In 2008, our senior executives were granted options with an exercise price of 17.5% in excess of the average of the high and low market price of our common shares on the NYSE on the date of the grant.
 
Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recognized $9,051,000, $4,549,000 and $1,705,000, of compensation expense, respectively, for the portion of stock option awards that vested during each year. Below is a summary of our stock option activity under the Plan for the year ended December 31, 2008.
 
 
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using an option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for grants in the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.
 
 
The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $6.80, $12.55 and $10.23, respectively. Cash received from option exercises for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $27,587,000, $34,648,000 and $75,665,000, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $79,997,000, $99,656,000 and $244,694,000, respectively.

Restricted Stock
 
Restricted stock awards are granted at the average of the high and low market price of our common shares on the NYSE on the date of grant and generally vest over five years. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recognized $3,201,000, $4,079,000 and $3,820,000 of compensation expense, respectively, for the portion of restricted stock awards that vested during each year. As of December 31, 2008, there was $3,772,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested shares granted under the Plan. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.74 years. Dividends paid on unvested shares are charged directly to retained earnings and amounted to $308,000, $533,000 and $842,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $4,472,000, $8,907,000 and $6,170,000, respectively.

Restricted Operating Partnership Units ("OP Units")
 
Restricted OP Units are granted at the average of the high and low market price of our common shares on the NYSE on the date of grant, vest ratably over five years and are subject to a taxable book-up event, as defined. The fair value of these awards on the date of grant, as adjusted for estimated forfeitures, was approximately $7,167,000, $10,696,000, and $3,480,000 for the awards granted in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and is amortized into expense over the five-year vesting period using a graded vesting attribution model. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recognized $6,257,000, $5,493,000, and $1,053,000, of compensation expense, respectively, for the portion of Restricted OP Units that vested during last year. As of December 31, 2008, there was $8,150,000 of total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested OP units granted under the Plan and the cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.78 years. Distributions paid on unvested OP Units are charged to "net income attributable to noncontrolling interests" on our consolidated statements of income and amounted to $938,000, $444,000, and $147,000 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Prior to December 2008, we had two defined benefit pension plans, a Vornado Realty Trust Retirement Plan ("Vornado Plan") and a Merchandise Mart Properties Pension Plan ("Mart Plan"). The benefits under the Vornado Plan and the Mart Plan (collectively, the "Plans") were frozen in December 1997 and June 1999, respectively. Benefits under the Plans are or were primarily based on years of service and compensation during employment or on years of credited service and established monthly benefits. Funding policy for the Plans was based on contributions at the minimum amounts required by law. In December 2008, we finalized the termination of the Vornado Plan which resulted in a $4,600,000 pension settlement expense which is included as a component of "general and administrative" expense on our consolidated statement of income. In addition, during the first quarter of 2009, we expect to finalize the termination of the Mart Plan, which will result in the recognition of a $2,800,000 pension settlement expense. The financial results of the Mart Plan, using a December 31, measurement date, are provided below.

As lessor:
 
We lease space to tenants under operating leases. Most of the leases provide for the payment of fixed base rentals payable monthly in advance. Office building leases generally require the tenants to reimburse us for operating costs and real estate taxes above their base year costs. Shopping center leases provide for the pass-through to tenants the tenants' share of real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance. Shopping center leases also provide for the payment by the lessee of additional rent based on a percentage of the tenants' sales. As of December 31, 2008, future base rental revenue under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding rents for leases with an original term of less than one year and rents resulting from the exercise of renewal options, is as follows:
 
 
These amounts do not include rentals based on tenants' sales. These percentage rents approximated $7,322,000, $9,379,000, and $7,593,000, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.
 
None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.
 
Former Bradlees Locations
 
Pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, dated May 1, 1992, we are due $5,000,000 per annum of additional rent from Stop & Shop which was allocated to certain of Bradlees former locations. On December 31, 2002, prior to the expiration of the leases to which the additional rent was allocated, we reallocated this rent to other former Bradlees leases also guaranteed by Stop & Shop. Stop & Shop is contesting our right to reallocate and claims that we are no longer entitled to the additional rent. At December 31, 2008, we are due an aggregate of $30,400,000. We believe the additional rent provision of the guaranty expires at the earliest in 2012 and we are vigorously contesting Stop & Shop's position.

As lessee:
 
We are a tenant under operating leases for certain properties. These leases have terms that expire during the next thirty years. Future minimum lease payments under operating leases at December 31, 2008, are as follows:
 
 
Rent expense was $29,320,000, $24,503,000, and $18,655,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
 
We are also a lessee under capital leases for real estate. Lease terms generally range from 5-20 years with renewal or purchase options. Capitalized leases are recorded at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the property. Capitalized leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the asset or life of the related lease, whichever is shorter. Amortization expense on capital leases is included in "depreciation and amortization" on our consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2008, future minimum lease payments under capital leases are as follows:
 
 
At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $6,788,000 and $6,820,000, respectively, representing the present value of net minimum payments are included in "Other Liabilities" on our consolidated balance sheets. Property leased under capital leases had a total cost of $6,216,000, and related accumulated depreciation of $1,717,000 and $1,562,000, at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Insurance
 
We carry commercial liability and all risk property insurance ((i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended coverage, (iv) "acts of terrorism" as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 ("TRIPRA"), which expires in December 2014, and (v) rental loss insurance) with respect to our assets. Our New York Office, Washington, DC Office, Retail and Merchandise Mart divisions have $2.0 billion of per occurrence all risk property insurance coverage, including terrorism coverage in effect through September 15, 2009. Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $150,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property, and a $150,000,000 annual aggregate.
 
In June 2007 we formed Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC ("PPIC"), a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, to act as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage and as a direct insurer for coverage for "certified" acts of terrorism and for nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological ("NBCR") acts, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 ("TRIPRA"). Coverage for "certified" acts of terrorism is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. Prior to the formation of PPIC, we were uninsured for losses under NBCR coverage. Subsequently, we have $2.0 billion of NBCR coverage under TRIPRA, for which PPIC is responsible for 15% of each NBCR loss and the insurance company deductible of $1,000,000. We are ultimately responsible for any loss borne by PPIC.
 
We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years.
 
Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties (which are generally non-recourse to us), senior unsecured notes, exchangeable senior debentures, convertible senior debentures and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance and/or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio.
 
Other Contractual Obligations
 
At December 31, 2008, there were $44,565,000 of outstanding letters of credit under our $0
.
965 billion revolving credit facility. Our credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.
 
Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us.
 
We are committed to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating approximately $213,352,000. Of this amount, $80,923,000 is committed to IPF and is pledged as collateral to IPF's lender.
 
From time to time, we have disposed of substantial amounts of real estate to third parties for which, as to certain properties, we remain contingently liable for rent payments or mortgage indebtedness that we cannot quantify.

Litigation
 
We are from time to time involved in various other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters, including the matters referred to above, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 
On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey ("USDC-NJ") claiming that we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect the $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, because of the expiration of the East Brunswick, Jersey City, Middletown, Union and Woodbridge leases to which the $5,000,000 of additional rent was previously allocated. Stop & Shop asserted that a prior order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York dated February 6, 2001, as modified on appeal to the District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 13, 2001, froze our right to reallocate which effectively terminated our right to collect the additional rent from Stop & Shop. On March 3, 2003, after we moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, Stop & Shop voluntarily withdrew its complaint. On March 26, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a new complaint in New York Supreme Court, asserting substantially the same claims as in its USDC-NJ complaint. We removed the action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In January 2005 that court remanded the action to the New York Supreme Court. On February 14, 2005, we served an answer in which we asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all the unpaid additional rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration that Stop & Shop will continue to be liable for the additional rent as long as any of the leases subject to the Master Agreement and Guaranty remain in effect. On May 17, 2005, we filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 15, 2005, Stop & Shop opposed our motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denying the motions for summary judgment. Both parties appealed the Court's decision and on December 14, 2006, the Appellate Court division issued a decision affirming the Court's decision. On January 16, 2007, we filed a motion for the reconsideration of one aspect of the Appellate Court's decision which was denied on March 13, 2007. We are currently engaged in discovery and anticipate that a trial date will be set for some time in 2009. We intend to vigorously pursue our claims against Stop & Shop. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
 
On May 24, 2007, we acquired a 70% controlling interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas and the 555 California Street complex. Our 70% interest was acquired through the purchase of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies that own, through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership interest and a 69% limited partnership interest in the partnerships that own the two properties. The remaining 30% limited partnership interest is owned by Donald J. Trump. In August 2005, Mr. Trump brought a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court against, among others, the general partners of the partnerships referred to above.   Mr. Trump's claims arose out of a dispute over the sale price of and use of proceeds from, the sale of properties located on the former Penn Central rail yards between West 59th and 72nd Streets in Manhattan which were formerly owned by the partnerships. In decisions dated September 14, 2005 and July 24, 2006, the Court denied several of Mr. Trump's motions and ultimately dismissed all of Mr. Trump's claims, except for his claim seeking access to books and records. In a decision dated October 1, 2007, the Court determined that Mr. Trump had already received access to the books and records to which he was entitled, with the exception of certain documents which were subsequently delivered to Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump sought re-argument and renewal on, and filed a notice of appeal in connection with, his dismissed claims.  In a decision dated January 6, 2009, the Court denied all of Mr. Trump's motions. Mr. Trump has filed a notice appealing the 2007 and 2009 decisions. In connection with the acquisition, we agreed to indemnify the sellers for liabilities and expenses arising out of Mr. Trump's claim that the general partners of the partnerships we acquired did not sell the rail yards at a fair price or could have sold the rail yards for a greater price and any other claims asserted in the legal action; provided however, that if Mr. Trump prevails on certain claims involving partnership matters, other than claims relating to sale price, the sellers will be required to reimburse us for certain costs related to those claims. We believe that the claims relating to the sale price are without merit. All other allegations are not asserted as a basis for damages and regardless of merit, and in our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows
.
 
In July 2005, we acquired H Street Building Corporation ("H Street") which has a subsidiary that owns, among other things, a 50% tenancy in common interest in land located in Arlington County, Virginia, known as "Pentagon Row," leased to two tenants. In April 2007, H-Street acquired the remaining 50% interest in that fee. In April 2007, we received letters from those tenants, Street Retail, Inc. and Post Apartment Homes, L.P., claiming they had a right of first offer triggered by each of those transactions. On September 25, 2008, both tenants filed suit against us and the former owners. The claim alleges the right to purchase the fee interest, damages in excess of $75,000,000 and punitive damages. We believe this claim is without merit and in our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows

Loan and Compensation Agreements
 
Pursuant to our annual compensation review in February 2002 with Joseph Macnow, our Chief Financial Officer, the Compensation Committee approved a $2,000,000 loan to Mr. Macnow, which bore interest at the applicable federal rate of 4.65% per annum and was scheduled to mature in June 2007. The loan was funded on July 23, 2002 and was collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the loan amount. On March 26, 2007, Mr. Macnow repaid to us his $2,000,000 outstanding loan.
 
Effective as of April 19, 2007, we entered into a new employment agreement with Mitchell Schear, the President of our Washington, DC Office Division. This agreement, which replaced his prior agreement, was approved by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Trustees and provides for a term of five years and is automatically renewable for one-year terms thereafter. The agreement also provides for a minimum salary of $1,000,000 per year and bonuses and other customary benefits. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on April 19, 2007, the Compensation Committee granted options to Mr. Schear to acquire 200,000 of our common shares at an exercise price of $119.94 per share. These options vest ratably over three years beginning in 2010 and accelerate on a change of control or if we terminate his employment without cause or by him for breach by us. The agreement also provides that if we terminate Mr. Schear's employment without cause or by him for breach by us, he will receive a lump-sum payment equal to one year's salary and bonus, up to a maximum of $2,000,000.
 
Transactions with Affiliates and Officers and Trustees of the Company
 
Alexander's
We own 32.5% of Alexander's. Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Michael D. Fascitelli, our President, are officers and directors of Alexander's. We provide various services to Alexander's in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements. These agreements are described in Note 6 - Investments in Partially Owned Entities to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
On September 9, 2008, Alexander's Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $7.00 per share, payable on October 30, 2008, to shareholders of record on October 14, 2008. The dividend was attributable to the liquidation of the wholly owned 731 Lexington Avenue taxable REIT subsidiary into Alexander's. Accordingly, on October 30, we received $11,578,000, which was accounted for as a reduction of our investment in Alexander's.
 
On September 15, 2008 and October 14, 2008, Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, who holds the same positions in Alexander's, exercised an aggregate of 200,000 of his SARs, which were scheduled to expire on March 4, 2009, and received gross proceeds of $62,809,000.
 
On March 13, 2007, Michael Fascitelli, our President, who also holds the same position in Alexander's, exercised 350,000 of his SARs, which were scheduled to expire on March 14, 2007, and he received gross proceeds of $50,465,000.
 
Interstate Properties ("Interstate")
 
Interstate is a general partnership in which Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board and Chief Executive Officer, is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander's, are Interstate's two other partners. As of December 31, 2008, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned approximately 8.8% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 27.0% of Alexander's common stock.
 
We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days' notice at the end of the term. We believe based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies that the management agreement terms are fair to us. We earned $803,000, $800,000 and $798,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Redeemable noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheets represent Operating Partnership units held by third-parties and are comprised of (i) Class A units, (ii) Series B convertible preferred units, and (iii) Series D-10, D-11, D-12, D-14 and D-15 (collectively, "Series D") cumulative redeemable preferred units. Class A units of the Operating Partnership may be tendered for redemption to the Operating Partnership for cash; we, at our option, may assume that obligation and pay the holder either cash or Vornado common shares on a one-for-one basis. Because the number of Vornado common shares outstanding at all times equals the number of Class A units owned by Vornado, the redemption value of each Class A unit is equivalent to the market value of one Vornado common share, and the quarterly distribution to a Class A unitholder is equal to the quarterly dividend paid to a Vornado common shareholder.

Income per share is computed in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 128. In January 2009, we adopted the provisions of FSP 03-6-1, which required us to include unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents as "participating securities" in the computation of basic and diluted income per share pursuant to the two-class method as described in SFAS 128. The adoption of FSP 03-6-1 did not have a material effect on our computation of income per share.
 
During 2009, we paid a portion of our first, second and third quarter dividends in Vornado common shares. In accordance with SFAS 128, we have included the 5,736,000 newly issued common shares in the computation of income per share retroactively for the periods presented below.
 
The following table provides a reconciliation of both net income and the number of common shares used in the computation of (i) basic income per common share - which utilizes the weighted average number of common shares outstanding without regard to dilutive potential common shares, and (ii) diluted income per common share - which includes the weighted average common shares and potentially dilutive share equivalents. Potentially dilutive share equivalents include our Series A convertible preferred shares, employee stock options, restricted share awards and exchangeable senior debentures due 2025.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures: Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 (e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
 
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
 
MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
 
Management of Vornado Realty Trust, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the "Company"), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
 
As of December 31, 2008, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in
Internal Control  Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 was effective.
 
Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the trustees of us; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
 
Our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page 121, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 
Shareholders and Board of Trustees
Vornado Realty Trust
New York, New York
 
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Vornado Realty Trust, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of trustees, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2008 and the related consolidated statements of income, statement of changes in equity, and cash flows for the year then ended of the Company and our report dated February 24, 2009 (October 13, 2009, as to the effects of the retrospective application of FSP APB 14-1, SFAS No. 160, and FSP EITF 03-6-1 as disclosed in Note 2) expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules.
