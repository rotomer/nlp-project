VORNADO REALTY L.P. (Exact Name of Registrant as Specified in Charter)
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instructions A.2.):
 
 
Item 7.01     Regulation FD Disclosure.
On March 2, 2010, a subsidiary of Vornado Realty Trust ("Vornado") notified the Master Servicer of the debt secured by properties in High Point, North Carolina (part of the Mart segment) that neither the subsidiary nor Vornado is prepared at this time to fund any shortfalls in debt service.  As a result, we requested that the loan be transferred to the Special Servicer.  As of December 31, 2009, the net book value of the properties was approximately $148.0 million and the non-recourse debt secured by the properties was approximately $217.8 million.
Further, a subsidiary of Vornado did not make the debt service payment due March 1, 2010 on a property in California (part of the Retail segment).  It is expected that the loan will be transferred to the Special Servicer.  At December 31, 2009, the net book value of the property was approximately $22.3 million and the non-recourse debt secured by the property was approximately $17.6 million.
There can be no assurance as to the timing and ultimate resolution of either of these matters.
The information set forth herein is furnished pursuant to Item 7.01Regulation FD Disclosure and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of such section nor shall the information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing of Vornado or Vornado Realty L.P.
