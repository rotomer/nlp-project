When distributions are not paid in full or a sum sufficient for such payment is not set apart, as aforesaid, all distributions declared upon Series D-16 Preferred Units and all distributions declared upon any other series or class or classes of Parity Units shall be declared ratably in proportion to the respective amounts of distributions accumulated and unpaid on the Series D-16 Preferred Units and such Parity Units, except in the case of distributions on the Series B2 Restricted Preferred Units to the extent not paid due to a lack of funds in the Nongovernmental Account.

Liquidation Preference
.  (i)  In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partnership or the General Partner, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any payment or distribution of the assets of the Partnership shall be made to or set apart for the holders of Junior Units, holders of the Series D-16 Preferred Units shall be entitled to receive the Redemption Price plus an amount equal to all distributions (whether or not earned or declared) accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution to such holders, but the holders of Series D-16 Preferred Units shall not be entitled to any further payment.  If, upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partners hip or the General Partner, the assets of the Partnership, or proceeds thereof, distributable to the holders of Series D-16 Preferred Units shall be insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid and liquidating payments on any other Parity Units, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of the Series D-16 Preferred Units and the holders of any such other Parity Units ratably in accordance with the respective amounts that would be payable on such
 
10
 
Series D-16 Preferred Units and any such other Parity Units if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full.

(ii)
  
Subject to the rights of the holders of Partnership Units of any series or class or classes of shares ranking on a parity with or prior to the Series D-16 Preferred Units upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the General Partner or the Partnership, after payment shall have been made in full to the holders of the Series D-16 Preferred Units, as provided in this Section, any series or class or classes of Junior Units shall, subject to any respective terms and provisions applying thereto, be entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holder of the Series D-16 Preferred Units shall not be entitled to share therein.
D.
               
The Partnership's Right to Redeem the Series D-16 Preferred Units
.  (i)  Except as set forth in Section 2.E below and the last sentence of this Section 2.D(i), the Series D-16 Preferred Units shall not be redeemable prior to the Permitted Redemption Date.  On and after the Permitted Redemption Date, the General Partner may, at its option, cause the Partnership to redeem the Series D-16 Preferred Units in whole or in part, as set forth herein, subject to the provisions described below, at the applicable Red emption Price.  In lieu of causing the Partnership to redeem the Series D-16 Preferred Units, the General Partner may, at its option, elect to purchase the Series D-16 Preferred Units for the same price and subject to the same terms upon which the Partnership would be permitted to redeem the Series D-16 Preferred Units in accordance with this Section 2.D. Upon any such redemption, the Partnership shall also pay any accumulated and unpaid distributions owing in respect of the Series D-16 Preferred Units being redeemed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may, at its option, prior to the Permitted Redemption Date, cause the Partnership to redeem, subject to the provisions described below and at the applicable Redemption Price, any Series D-16 Preferred Units, in whole or in part, held by a holder (x) whose basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes in such Series D-16 Preferred Units is stepped-up under Section 1014 of the Code, (y) who is a qualified charitable institution or an Institutio nal Lender who has obtained such Series D-16 Preferred Units as a result of a default by the holder of such Series D-16 Preferred Units on a loan from the Institutional Lender or (z) who is a transferee from such holder described in clauses (x) and (y) above.
(ii)
  
The Redemption Price in respect of each Series D-16 Preferred Unit shall be payable in cash.  The Partnership shall provide the holder of each Series D-16 Preferred Unit intended to be redeemed pursuant to this Section D not less than 61 calendar days notice of the date of such redemption.  Any notice of redemption delivered pursuant to this Section 2.D(ii) will be (x) faxed and (y) mailed  by certified mail, postage prepaid, not less than 61 calendar days prior to the date upon which such redemption is to occur (the "
Redemption Date
"), addressed to each holder of record of the Series D-16 Preferred Units at their respective addresses as they appear on the records of the Partnership.  No immaterial defect in such notice shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any Series D-16 Preferred Units.  In addition to any information required by law, each such notice shall state:  (a) the Redemption Date, (b) the aggregate number of Series D-16 Preferred Units to be redeemed and, if fewer than all of the outstanding Series D-16 Preferred Units are to be redeemed, the number of Series D-16 Preferred Units to be redeemed held by such holder, which number shall equal such holder's pro rata share (based on the percentage of the aggregate number of
 
11
 
outstanding Series D-16 Preferred Units that the total number of Series D-16 Preferred Units held by such holder represents and determined as nearly as practicable without creating fractional interests) of the aggregate number of Series D-16 Preferred Units to be redeemed, (c) the place or places where such Series D-16 Preferred Units are to be surrendered for payment of the amount payable upon redemption and (d)  that payment of such amount will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Series D-16 Preferred Units.  If the Partnership gives a notice of redemption in respect of Series D-16 Preferred Units pursuant to this Section 2.D(ii), then, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Redemption Date, the Partnership will deposit irrevocably in trust for the benefit of the holders of Series D-16 Preferred Units being redeemed funds sufficient to pa y the applicable amount payable with respect to such Series D-16 Preferred Units and will give irrevocable instructions and authority to pay such amount to the holders of the Series D-16 Preferred Units upon surrender of the Series D-16 Preferred Units by such holders at the place designated in the notice of redemption.
(iii)
Upon any redemption of Series D-16 Preferred Units, the Partnership shall pay any accumulated and unpaid distributions for any Distribution Period, or any other period shorter than a full Distribution Period, ending on or prior to the Redemption Date.  On and after the Redemption Date, distributions will cease to accumulate on the Series D-16 Preferred Units called for redemption, unless the Partnership defaults in payment therefor.  If any date fixed for redemption of Series D-16 Preferred Units is not a Unit Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Unit Business Day (and without any interest or other pay ment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Unit Business Day falls in the next calendar year, such payment will be made on the immediately preceding Unit Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date fixed for redemption.  If payment of the Redemption Price is improperly withheld or refused and not paid by the Partnership, distributions on such Series D-16 Preferred Units will continue to accumulate at the Annual Distribution Rate from the original redemption date to the date of payment, in which case the actual payment date will be considered the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the applicable Redemption Price.  Except as provided above, the Partnership shall make no payment or allowance for unpaid distributions, whether or not in arrears, on Series D-16 Preferred Units called for redemption under this Section 2.D.

Series D-16 Preferred Unit Holder Redemption Right
.
(i)
                
General
.  (a) Subject to paragraphs (ii) and (iii) below, on or after the first anniversary of the Permitted Redemption Date, with respect to each Series D-16 Preferred Unit, the holder of such Series D-16 Preferred Unit shall have the right (the "
Series D-16 Redemption Right
") to require the Partnership to redeem such Series D-16 Preferred Unit on any Series D-16 Specified Redemption Date at the applicable Redemption Price.  Any such Series D-16 Redemption Right shall be exercised pursuant to notice of redemption comparable to the Notice of Redemption required under Section 8.6 of the Agreement (a "
Series D-16 Notice of Redemption
") delivered to the Partnership (with a copy to the General Partner) by the Limited Partner who is exercising the Series D-16 Redemption Right (the "
Series D-16 Redeeming Partner
").  A holder of the Series D-16 Preferred Units may not exercise the Series D-16 Redemption Right in respect of less than all of the Series D-16 Preferred Units held by such holder on the date of the applicable Series D-16 Redemption Notice.  Other than causing the Partnership to comply with its obligations hereunder, the General Partner shall not have any obligation to the Redeeming Partner or to the Partnership with respect to the Redeeming Partner's exercise of the Series D-16 Redemption Right.  In lieu of causing the Part nership to redeem the Series D-16 Preferred Units, the General Partner may, at its option, elect to purchase the Series D-16 Preferred Units for the same price and subject to the same terms upon which the Partnership would be permitted to redeem the Series D-16 Preferred Units in accordance with this Section 2.E.  In addition, any redemption pursuant to the Series D-16 Redemption Right shall be subject to all of the provisions of the Agreement governing redemptions under Section 8.6 of the Agreement as if it were a redemption under that section, except as otherwise provided herein.  The Redemption Price in respect of each Series D-16 Preferred Unit shall be payable in cash.
                        (b)      &nbs p; The Series D-16 Redeeming Partner shall have no right with respect to any Series D-16 Preferred Units so redeemed to receive any distributions paid after the Series D-16 Specified Redemption Date, unless the record date for the distribution preceded the Series D-16 Specified Redemption Date.  If the record date for such distribution was a date prior to the Series D-16 Specified Redemption Date and the Distribution Payment Date in respect of such distribution was a date after the Series D-16 Specified Redemption Date, such Series D-16 Redeeming Partner shall be required, as a condition of the redemption of such Series D-16 Preferred Units, to pay the amount of such distribution to the Partnership.
                       ;  (c)        The Assignee of any Limited Partner may exercise the rights of such Limited Partner pursuant to this Section 2.E, and such Limited Partner shall be deemed to have assigned such rights to such Assignee and shall be bound by the exercise of such rights by such Limited Partner's Assignee.  In connection with any exercise of such rights by such Assignee on behalf of such Limited Partner, the Redemption Price and any accumulated and unpaid distributions shall be paid by the Partnership directly to such Assignee and not to such Limited Partner.
                        (d)      
(ii)
  
Intentionally Omitted.

No Liens on Partnership Units Delivered for Redemption
.  Each holder of any Series D-16 Preferred Units covenants and agrees with the General Partner that all Series D-16 Preferred Units delivered for redemption shall be delivered to the Partnership or the General Partner, as the case may be, free and clear of all liens, and, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, neither the General Partner nor the Partnership shall be under any obligation to acquire Series D-16 Preferred Units which are or may be subject to any liens.  Each holder of Series D-16 Preferred Units furth er agrees that, in the event any state or local property transfer tax is payable as a result of the transfer of its Series D-16 Preferred Units to the Partnership or the General Partner, such holder shall assume and pay such transfer tax.

F.
                 
Conversion

(a)
               
The Series D-16 Preferred Units shall be Preference Units and shall receive distributions on a basis
pari
passu
with other Partnership Units, if any, receiving distributions pursuant to Section 5.1.B(i) of the Agreement, except to the extent that distributions on the Series B2 Restricted Preferred Units may not be paid due to a lack of funds in the Nongovernmental Account.
(b)
              
Distributions made pursuant to Subsection 2.G(ii)(a) of this
Exhibit AN
shall be made pro rata with other distributions made to other Partnership Units as to which they rank
pari
passu
based on the ratio of the amounts to be paid the Series D-16 Preferred Units and such other Partnership Units, as applicable, to the total amounts to be paid in respect of the Series D-16 Preferred Units and such other Partnership Units taken together on the Partnership Record Date, except in the case of distributions on the Series B2 Restricted Preferred Units to the extent such distributions may not be paid due to a lack of funds in the Nongovernmental Account.
(iii)
The initial balance of the portion of the initial holder's Capital Account attributable to each Series D-16  Preferred Unit shall be equal to $25,000,000. This amount will be reduced by distributions and allocations of losses made with respect to each such Series D-16 Preferred Unit and increased by allocations of income with respect to each such Series D-16 Preferred Unit. For purposes of allocations of items made pursu ant to Article VI of the Agreement, the Series D-16 Preferred Units shall be Preference Units and the portion of the holder's Capital Account attributable to each Series D-16 Preferred Unit shall be allocated (i) income in an amount equal to the amount of distributions in respect of such Series D-16 Preferred Unit in accordance with Section 6.1.A(ii) and (ii) items of loss in
 
15
 
accordance with Section 6.1.B(x) of the Agreement, and shall share in those allocations in a pro rata manner based on the distributions and allocations of items, as applicable, made to Preference Units; references to Preference Units in Article VI of the Agreement shall be deemed to also refer to Series D-16 Preferred Units except that references to distributions made to Preference Units shall be deemed to refer to distributions made to the Series D-16 Preferred Units in a pro rata manner with such distributions, if any, made to the Preference Units.  As a result, the portion of each holder's Capital Account attributable to a Series D-16 Preferred Unit will generally be allocated income equal to the cash distributed in respect of such Series D-16 Preferred Unit (and losses previously allocated to them).  This allocation would occur prior to any allocation of income to Units other than Preference Units.  In the event the Partnership incurs an amount of losses in excess of the aggregate amount of the Capital Accounts with respect to the Units (other than Preference Units), any additional loss would be allocated to the holders of the Series D-16 Preferred Units in accordance with Section 6.1.B(x) of the Agreement.

.  (i)  At such time, if any, as the General Partner becomes a holder of Series D-16 Preferred Units, the rights of the General Partner, in its capacity as the holder of the Series D-16 Preferred Units, will be in addition to and not in limitation of any other rights or authority of the General Partner, in any other capacity, under the Agreement.
