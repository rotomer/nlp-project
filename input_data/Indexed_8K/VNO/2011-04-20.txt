Actions against Parties; Notification
.  Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement.  In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company.  An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action;
provided
,
however
, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the
indemnified party.  In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.

(d)
                                
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
.  If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel in accordance with Section 6(a)(iii) hereof, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into, (iii) such indemnifying party, if it has not theretofore paid such reimbursement, is requested again to pay reimbursement at least five, but not more than ten, days prior to such settlement being entered into, and (iv) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
 
SECTION 7.
                                                       
Contribution
.  If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying
party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
 
The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company
and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Final Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover.
 
The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7.  The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 7, each officer or director of each Underwriter and person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 
20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each trustee, partner or officer, as the case may be, of the Company or the Operating Partnership, including without limitation each officer who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Operating Partnership within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company or the Operating Partnership, as the case may be.
 
SECTION 8.
                                                       
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery
.  All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriters or any controlling person of an Underwriter, or by or on behalf of the Company or the Operating Partnership or any officer or trustee or partner or controlling person
of the Company or the Operating Partnership, and shall survive delivery of the Securities to the Underwriters.
 
SECTION 9.

(a)
                                 
Termination; General
.  The Representatives may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to Closing Time (i) if there has been, since the time of execution of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, any material adverse change in or affecting the condition, financial or otherwise, or the earnings or business affairs of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) if there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States, or any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis or any change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to commence or continue the offering of the Securities to the public or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (iii) if trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or if trading generally on the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by any of such exchanges or by order of the Commission or any other governmental authority, or (iv) if a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities or (v) if, since the time of execution of this Agreement, there shall have been any downgrading in the rating assigned to the Securities or any of the Company's other securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as such term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the 1933 Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential downgrading in any such rating.
 
(b)
                                
Liabilities
.  If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 6, 7 and 8 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.

If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in the Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement.
 
(b)

(c)
          
Termination
.  If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives or the Company, or both, as provided in subsection (a) above, the number of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-tenth of the number of the Securities to be purchased on such date, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the party of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters provided in Section 4 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Sections 6 and 7 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

The Shares are to be issued in an underwritten public offering pursuant to a Prospectus Supplement, dated April 13, 2011 (the "Prospectus Supplement").
 
In connection with our representation of the Company, and as a basis for the opinion hereinafter set forth, we have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the following documents (collectively, the "Documents"):
 
1.             The Registration Statement and the related form of prospectus included therein in the form in which it was transmitted to the Commission under the 1933 Act;
 
2.             The Prospectus Supplement, filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act;
 
3.             The Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, as amended and supplemented, of the Company (the "Declaration of Trust"), certified by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (the "SDAT");
 
4.             The Bylaws of the Company, certified as of the date hereof by an officer of the Company;
 
 
5.             Resolutions adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Company, or a duly authorized committee thereof, relating to, among other matters, the sale, issuance and registration of the Shares (the "Resolutions"), certified as of the date hereof by an officer of the Company;
 
6.             A certificate of the SDAT as to the good standing of the Company, dated as of a recent date;

In expressing the opinion set forth below, we have assumed the following:
 
1.             Each individual executing any of the Documents, whether on behalf of such individual or another person, is legally competent to do so.

Each of the parties (other than the Company) executing any of the Documents has duly and validly executed and delivered each of the Documents to which such party is a signatory, and such party's obligations set forth therein are legal, valid and binding and are enforceable in accordance with all stated terms.
 
4.             All Documents submitted to us as originals are authentic.
