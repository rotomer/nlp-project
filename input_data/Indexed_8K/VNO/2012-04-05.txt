Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
(e)           On March 30, 2012, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Trustees of Vornado Realty Trust ("Vornado") approved the establishment for fiscal 2012 of an annual incentive program for Vornado's senior executive management team that formulaically ties annual incentive award payouts to achieving a comparable funds from operations ("Comparable FFO") performance threshold and provides for a maximum aggregate award pool based on performance.  Under the annual incentive program, members of Vornado's senior executive management team, including Vornado's Chairman as well as its President and Chief Executive Officer, will have the ability to earn annual cash incentive payments and/or equity awards if and only if Vornado achieves Comparable FFO of at least 80% or more of the prior year Comparable FFO.  In the event that Vornado fails to achieve Comparable FFO of 80% or more of the prior year Comparable FFO, no incentive payments would be earned or paid under the program.  Moreover, even if Vornado achieves the stipulated Comparable FFO performance requirement under the annual incentive program, the Compensation Committee retains the right, consistent with best practices, to elect to make no payments under the program.  Comparable FFO excludes the impact of certain non-recurring items such as income or loss from discontinued operations, the sale or mark-to-market of marketable securities or derivatives and early extinguishment of debt, restructuring costs and non-cash impairment losses, among others, and thus the Compensation Committee believes provides a better metric than total FFO for assessing management's performance for the year. A discussion of Vornado's FFO as adjusted for comparability may be found in Vornado's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 in Part II, Item 7, under "Funds From Operations".
 
Aggregate incentive awards earned under the annual incentive program by our senior executive management team are subject to a cap of 1.25% of Comparable FFO earned by Vornado for the year, with individual award allocations under the program determined by the Compensation Committee based on an assessment of individual and overall performance.
 
On March 30, 2012, Vornado's Compensation Committee approved Vornado's 2012 Out-Performance Plan, a multi-year, performance-based equity compensation plan and related form of award agreement, the 2012 Outperformance Plan (the "2012 OPP").  Under the 2012 OPP, participants, including Vornado's Chairman as well as its President and Chief Executive Officer, have the opportunity to earn compensation payable in the form of equity awards if and only if Vornado outperforms a predetermined total shareholder return ("TSR") and/or outperforms the market with respect to relative total TSR in any year during a three-year performance period.   Specifically, awards under our 2012 OPP may potentially be earned if Vornado (i) achieves a TSR above that of the SNL US REIT Index (the "Index") over a one-year, two-year or three-year performance period (the "Relative Component"), and/or (ii) achieves a TSR level greater than 7% per annum, or 21% over the three-year performance period (the "Absolute Component").  To the extent awards would be earned under the Absolute Component of the 2012 OPP but Vornado underperforms the Index, such awards earned under the Absolute Component would be reduced (and potentially fully negated) based on the degree to which Vornado underperforms the Index.  In certain circumstances, in the event Vornado outperforms the Index but awards would not otherwise be earned under the Absolute Component, awards may still be earned under the Relative Component.  Moreover, to the extent awards would otherwise be earned under the Relative Component but Vornado fails to achieve at least a 6% per annum absolute TSR level, such awards earned under the Relative Component would be reduced based on Vornado's absolute TSR performance, with no awards being earned in the event Vornado's TSR during the applicable measurement period is 0% or negative, irrespective of the degree to which it may outperform the Index.  If the designated performance objectives are achieved, OPP Units are also subject to time-based vesting requirements. Share dividend payments on awards issued accrue during the performance period and are paid to participants if and only if awards are ultimately earned based on the achievement of the designated performance objectives.  A form of Vornado's 2012 OPP Award Agreement is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.  In connection with approval of the 2012 OPP, on March 30, 2012, Vornado, as the managing general partner of Vornado Realty L.P., the operating partnership through which Vornado conducts its business, approved the Forty-Fourth Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Vornado Realty L.P.

Upon the occurrence of (a) a Change in Control, and (b) the termination of employment of the Grantee with the Company or its Affiliates within 24 months of such Change in Control (i) by the Company (or its successor) without Cause or (ii) by the Grantee with Good Reason, then any Award OPP Units that have not been previously forfeited (after giving effect to any forfeiture of Award OPP Units pursuant to the calculations set forth in this hereof occurring in connection with such Change in Control) shall vest immediately.

In the event of a Change in Control, the Committee will make any determinations and certifications required by this Agreement and any provisions necessary with

For avoidance of doubt, in the event of a Change in Control, the performance of all calculations and actions pursuant to ,  and  hereof and the exercise of any election, voting or other rights pursuant to this  shall be conditioned upon the final consummation of such Change in Control.

(a)
                                
If the Grantee is a party to a Service Agreement and his or her Continuous Service terminates, the provisions of , , , ,  and  hereof shall govern the treatment of the Grantee's Award OPP Units exclusively, unless the Service Agreement contains provisions that expressly refer to this  and provides that those provisions of the Service Agreement shall instead govern the treatment of the Grantee's Award OPP Units upon such termination.  The foregoing sentence will be deemed an amendment to any applicable Service Agreement to the extent required to apply its terms consistently with this , such that, by way of illustration, any provisions of the Service Agreement with respect to accelerated vesting or payout or the lapse of forfeiture restrictions relating to the Grantee's incentive or other compensation awards in the event of certain types of termination of the Grantee's Continuous Service with the Company (such as, for example, termination at the end of the term, termination without Cause by the employer or termination for Good Reason by the employee) shall not be interpreted as requiring that any calculations set forth in hereof be performed, or vesting occur with respect to this Award other than as specifically provided in this .  In the event that an entity to which the Grantee provides services ceases to be an Affiliate of the Company, such action shall be deemed to be a termination of the Grantee's Continuous Service for purposes of this Agreement, that the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, may make provision in such circumstances for the lapse of forfeiture restrictions and/or accelerated vesting of some or all of the Grantee's unvested Award OPP Units that have not previously been forfeited, effective immediately prior to such event, or determine that the Grantee's Continuous Service to the Company or any other of its Affiliates has not been terminated.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, in the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Grantee's Service Agreement, if any, and the provisions of this with respect to death or Disability, the provisions of such Service Agreement shall govern the treatment of the Grantee's Award OPP Units in the event of death or Disability.

For the avoidance of doubt, the purpose of this  is to prevent a situation where grantees of 2012 OPP awards who have had a Qualified Termination would be able to realize the value of their Award OPP Units or Award Partnership Units (through Transfer or redemption) before other grantees of 2012 OPP awards whose Continuous Service continues through the applicable vesting dates set forth in  hereof.
