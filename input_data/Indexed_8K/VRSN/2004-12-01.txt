Item 8.01. Other Events.
 
VeriSign, Inc. ("VeriSign" or the "Company") today announced that on November 22, 2004 it sold 18,000 ordinary shares of its Japan subsidiary, VeriSign Japan K.K. ("VSJ"), representing approximately 7% of VeriSign's ownership interest in VSJ, for approximately $78 million. After giving effect to the sale, VeriSign continues to own a majority stake in VSJ equal to approximately 52% of VSJ's total shares outstanding. Currently, VeriSign has no plans to sell any additional VSJ shares.
 
VeriSign also announced that it used the proceeds from the sale of the VSJ shares to repurchase approximately 2.4 million shares of the Company's common stock in the open market at prices ranging from $31.00 per share to $34.93 per share during the period November 24 through December 1, 2004. The Company's previously announced share repurchase program authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $350 million of its common stock on the open market or in negotiated or block trades. Since inception of this program in 2001, VeriSign has repurchased approximately 6.1 million shares of common stock for approximately $183 million. Approximately $167 million remain available for future repurchases under this program. The Company will continue to monitor the market environment for additional opportunities to repurchase shares as conditions warrant, however, there can be no assurance if or when any such purchases might occur.
