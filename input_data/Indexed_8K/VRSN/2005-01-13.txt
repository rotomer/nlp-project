Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On January 10, 2005, VeriSign, Inc. signed a definitive agreement to acquire LightSurf Technologies, Inc. ("LightSurf"). Under the terms of the agreement, VeriSign agreed to issue shares of its Common Stock having a value of approximately $270 million for all of the outstanding capital stock, warrants and vested options of LightSurf and to pay certain transaction-related expenses of LightSurf. In addition, VeriSign will assume all unvested stock options of LightSurf. Of the consideration to be received by stockholders of LightSurf, 15% will be held in escrow for a period of one year to satisfy certain indemnification obligations. VeriSign will also be entitled to make claims for indemnification for certain matters related to intellectual property, tax and capitalization subsequent to the escrow period.
 
The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including termination of applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the issuance of a permit from the California Department of Corporations. The transaction is anticipated to close by the end of the first quarter of 2005.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
