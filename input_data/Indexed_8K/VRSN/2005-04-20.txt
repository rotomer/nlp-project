On April 20, 2005, VeriSign, Inc. ("VeriSign" or the "Company") announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 and certain other information. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
 
VeriSign provides quarterly and annual financial statements that are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Along with this information, we typically disclose and discuss certain non-GAAP financial information in our quarterly earnings releases, on investor conference calls and during investor conferences and related events. This non-GAAP financial information does not include the following types of financial measures that are included in GAAP: amortization and write-down of goodwill and intangible assets related to acquisitions, the net gain on the sale of investments or the impairment of investments, restructuring and other recoveries/charges, and stock-based compensation charges related to acquisitions. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial data supplements our GAAP financial data by providing investors with additional information which allows them to have a clearer picture of the company's core operations. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the non-GAAP information enhances the investors' overall understanding of our financial performance and the comparability of the company's operating results from period to period. In the press release attached hereto to as Exhibit 99.1, we have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial information that we provide each quarter with the comparable financial information reported in accordance with GAAP for the given period.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
VeriSign, Inc. (Nasdaq: VRSN), the leading provider of intelligent infrastructure services for the Internet and telecommunications networks, today reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2005.
MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA  April 20, 2005 
 
VeriSign reported revenue of $401 million for the first quarter of 2005, a 75 percent increase compared to the same period of 2004. On a GAAP basis, VeriSign reported net income of $49 million for the first quarter and earnings per share of $0.19 per fully-diluted share. This compares with net income of $9 million and earnings per share of $.04 per fully-diluted share for the same period of 2004.
 
On a non-GAAP, after tax basis, using a 30% effective tax rate on non-GAAP pre-tax income of $95 million, earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.25 per fully-diluted share, as compared to non-GAAP pre-tax income of $50 million and earnings per fully-diluted share of $0.14 for the same period in 2004. These non-GAAP results exclude the following items, which are included under GAAP: amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, the net gain or loss on the sale of investments or the impairment of investments, restructuring and other recoveries/charges, and stock-based compensation charges related to acquisitions. A table reconciling the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers reported above is appended to this release.
 
"Our first quarter results represent a strong start to the year and an exciting beginning to our second decade as a company," said Stratton Sclavos, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of VeriSign. "With continued growth in our Internet and Communications segments, we remain confident in, and committed to, our mission of enabling and protecting all forms of interactions across the world's voice and data networks."
 
"Increased demand for our Internet and Communications services led to record revenues and operating income for Q1," said Dana Evan, Chief Financial Officer of VeriSign. "Given the strong unit volumes across our businesses in Q1 and the recurring nature of our revenues, we would expect to see solid performance throughout the year."
 
Within VeriSign's Internet Services Group (ISG), the VeriSign Security Services (VSS) business achieved a number of milestones during the quarter. Highlights included the announcement of new products, channels and customers for the VeriSign Unified Authentication platform, including a contract award at Bank of America. In addition, an enhanced family of strong authentication tokens was announced in February including a multi-purpose USB token that combines one-time password (OTP) and PKI technology with secure flash storage as well as an OTP-only token that delivers among the industry's lowest total cost of ownership.
 
The VeriSign Naming and Directory Services (VNDS) business saw increased new registrations and renewal rates for its .com and .net domain name business. The company was also notified by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, that the VeriSign proposal to continue operating the domain registry was ranked highest among all bidders. Based on this designation, VeriSign and ICANN have entered into negotiations in order to reach a mutually acceptable registry agreement.

The VeriSign Communications Services (VCS) business saw continued momentum in its mobile content business in the first quarter with the expansion of services to certain US and European customers. In addition, VCS announced the availability of the VeriSign Push-To-Talk Service for evaluation by mobile operators to accelerate deployment of services that provide instant access to communications, multimedia content and mobile applications for enterprises and consumers. As part of VeriSign's mobile content strategy, VeriSign announced on April 7th the successful completion of its acquisition of Santa Cruz, California-based LightSurf which is a global leader in multimedia messaging and interoperability solutions for the wireless market.
