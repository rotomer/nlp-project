Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On November 18, 2005, VeriSign, Inc. ("VeriSign" or the "Company") entered into a $250 million accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") agreement with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated ("MSCO"). Under the ASR agreement, the Company purchased 10.8 million shares of its common stock at a price per share of approximately $23.14. VeriSign acquired these shares as part of its previously announced program to repurchase up to $500 million of the Company's common stock in open market, negotiated or block transactions.
 
Under the ASR agreement, MSCO plans to purchase an equivalent number of shares of common stock in the open market from time to time until it has acquired that number. At the end of this period, the Company may receive, or may be required to remit, a price adjustment based upon the volume weighted average price of its common shares during the period. The purchase price adjustment can be settled, at the election of the Company, in cash or in shares of its common stock. The program is subject to a cap that will establish the maximum price per share.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
