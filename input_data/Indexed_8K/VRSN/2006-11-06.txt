Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On October 31, 2006, VeriSign, Inc. ("VeriSign") entered into a Severance and General Release Agreement (the "Agreement") with Vernon Irvin, Executive Vice President of VeriSign Communications Services.
In consideration of Mr. Irvin's service with the Company and in exchange for Mr. Irvin's release of claims and covenant not to sue, the Company will pay Mr. Irvin a severance payment in the total amount of $683,520.00, 67% of which will be paid within one month of the date Mr. Irvin executes the Agreement and the other 33% of which will be paid on the one year anniversary of the termination of his employment, subject to Mr. Irvin's compliance with non-solicitation and non-competition provisions. The Company will also pay Mr. Irvin up to approximately $215,000, representing 84% of his 2006 target bonus based on the performance of both the Company and VeriSign Communications Services. The payment of the 2006 bonus will be made at the time that VeriSign issues annual bonuses to its employees, which typically occurs in March. The Company will also make payments to Mr. Irvin for his COBRA and life insurance premiums, and will also provide certain administrative and other support as set forth in the Agreement.
Upon termination of Mr. Irvin's employment with VeriSign and subject to compliance with applicable law and any stock option exercise limitation imposed by the Board of Directors, VeriSign will accelerate vesting of twenty-five percent (25%) of Mr. Irvin's then unvested stock options to purchase shares of VeriSign common stock for which the fair market value is greater than the exercise price of his employment on the termination date. Also upon termination of Mr. Irvin's employment, and subject to compliance with applicable law, VeriSign will accelerate vesting of twenty-five percent (25%) of his then unvested restricted stock units of VeriSign common stock.
The foregoing is a summary of the terms and conditions of the Agreement and does not purport to be complete. The foregoing is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.01 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

If your post termination exercise period is greater than 30 days from the date the option exercise suspension is lifted your longer period will apply (e.g. If the option exercise suspension is lifted on November 15, 2006 and you would have had 90 days after your employment termination to exercise your options under the applicable stock option plan then per the applicable plan you will have the longer period to exercise your options rather than only 30 days).
