Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On January 29, 2007, VeriSign, Inc. ("") and Fox Entertainment (""), a subsidiary of News Corporation, and various subsidiaries of VeriSign and Fox, entered into a formation agreement under which VeriSign contributed its Jamba "business to consumer" business and Fox contributed its Fox Mobile Entertainment assets to two joint ventures to provide mobile entertainment to consumers on a global basis. One of the joint ventures is based in the Netherlands, and the other is based in the United States. Under the formation agreement, Fox paid VeriSign approximately $187.5 million in cash. Each party made a variety of customary representations and warranties regarding the assets contributed to the joint venture and agreed to indemnify the joint ventures for a breach of these representations and warranties, subject to limitations. These representations and warranties will survive for a period of 18 months, subject to certain exceptions.

Fox
VeriSign and Fox also entered into a joint venture agreement on January 31, 2007. Under the agreement, Fox (through a subsidiary) will own a 51 percent interest in the joint venture, Netherlands Mobile Holdings, C.V., and VeriSign (through a subsidiary) will own a 49 percent interest in the joint venture. The parties entered into a substantially similar joint venture agreement with respect to the U.S. based mobile entertainment business; however, that agreement is not currently considered a material agreement for VeriSign. Fox is entitled to appoint four of the seven members of the board of managers of the joint venture, and VeriSign is entitled to appoint the remaining three members. The parties also agreed to make capital contributions to the joint venture to fund the operations of venture, subject to certain conditions. VeriSign is not required to contribute more than $49 million to this joint venture and the separate U.S. joint venture. Fox may purchase the remaining interest of VeriSign in the joint venture (and the U.S.-based joint venture) or VeriSign can require Fox to purchase VeriSign's remaining interest in the joint venture (and the U.S.-based joint venture) at varying amounts of consideration at specified times over the course of a five year period, including upon a change in control of VeriSign. The price for these options is pre-determined, except that in the case of certain call rights of Fox, the purchase price will be the greater of the pre-determined amount or the fair market value of VeriSign's joint venture interests.
VeriSign also agreed not to operate or engage in any direct to consumer mobile business substantially similar to the businesses currently conducted by the businesses being contributed to the joint ventures, provided, however, that VeriSign is permitted to conduct a "business to business" and certain other activities described in the agreement.
