On May 8, 2008, VeriSign, Inc. ("VeriSign" or the "Company") announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2008 and certain other information. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
The information in this Form 8-K and the Exhibit attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
VeriSign provides quarterly and annual financial statements that are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Along with this information, we typically disclose and discuss certain non-GAAP financial information in our quarterly earnings releases, on investor conference calls and during investor conferences and related events. This non-GAAP financial information does not include the following types of financial measures that are included in GAAP: loss from discontinued operations, loss from non-core businesses, stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring costs, non-recurring costs, and gains and losses on investments and derivatives. Non-GAAP financial information is also adjusted for a 30% tax rate which differs from the GAAP tax rate.
Management believes that this non-GAAP financial data supplements our GAAP financial by providing investors with additional information that allows them to have a clearer picture of the company's core operations. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the non-GAAP information enhances the investors' overall understanding of our financial performance and the comparability of the company's operating results from period to period. In the press release attached hereto to as Exhibit 99.1, we have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial information that we provide each quarter with the comparable financial information reported in accordance with GAAP for the given period.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
VeriSign, Inc. (Nasdaq: VRSN), the leading provider of Internet infrastructure for the networked world, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2008.
MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA  May 8, 2008 
VeriSign reported revenue of $354 million for the first quarter of 2008. On a GAAP basis, VeriSign reported a net loss of $19 million and a net loss per share of $0.09. These GAAP results reflect a $25.5 million impairment on certain assets held for sale as well as a restructuring charge of $26.5 million for both continuing and discontinued operations.
VeriSign also reported segment revenue for Internet Infrastructure and Identity Services (3IS), or the "core businesses": Naming, SSL, and IAS. The company reported revenue for the core businesses of $223 million, up 5% from Q4 and up 23% year over year.
On a non-GAAP basis (which excludes the items described below) for our core businesses, VeriSign reported net income of $44 million for the first quarter of 2008 and earnings per share of $0.21 per fully-diluted share. A table reconciling the GAAP to non-GAAP results reported above is appended to this release.
"Our first quarter non-GAAP results represent strong growth in our core businesses as well as better than expected performance from the businesses to be divested," said Bill Roper, president and chief executive officer of VeriSign. "We are pleased that our strategy is beginning to show momentum and we will continue to invest in our core businesses."
"This is a strong start to our fiscal year as we continue to focus on key operational priorities," said Brian Robins, acting chief financial officer of VeriSign. "In addition to strong revenue growth this quarter in our core businesses, non-GAAP operating margin for core services was 30.3% and we repurchased approximately 14% of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2007 while maintaining a healthy balance sheet."
