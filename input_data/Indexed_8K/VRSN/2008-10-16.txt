(e) On October 14, 2008, the Compensation Committee of VeriSign, Inc. (the "Company") approved an amendment to the grant of restricted stock units made to D. James Bidzos in his capacity as the Company's Executive Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer on an interim basis, on August 4, 2008, as reported in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K/A, filed August 8, 2008. In keeping with equity award acceleration provisions afforded other executive officers of the Company under their Change-in-Control and Retention Agreements, the amendment provides for an acceleration of all unvested and outstanding restricted stock units under such grant in full immediately prior to the occurrence of a change-in-control of the Company. The definition of change-in-control is identical to that found in the Change-in-Control and Retention Agreements.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
