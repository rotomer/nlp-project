On November 6, 2008, VeriSign, Inc. ("VeriSign" or the "Company") announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2008 and certain other information. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
The information in this Form 8-K and the Exhibit attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
VeriSign provides quarterly and annual financial statements that are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Along with this information, we typically disclose and discuss certain non-GAAP financial information in our quarterly earnings releases, on investor conference calls and during investor conferences and related events. This non-GAAP financial information does not include the following types of financial measures that are included in GAAP: discontinued operations, non-core businesses in continuing operations, stock-based compensation, amortization of other intangible assets, restructuring costs, non-recurring costs, and gains and losses on derivatives and equity investments. Non-GAAP financial information is also adjusted for a 30% tax rate which differs from the GAAP tax rate.
Management believes that this non-GAAP financial data supplements our GAAP financial data by providing investors with additional information that allows them to have a clearer picture of the company's core operations. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the non-GAAP information enhances the investors' overall understanding of our financial performance and the comparability of the company's operating results from period to period. In the press release attached hereto to as Exhibit 99.1, we have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial information that we provide each quarter with the comparable financial information reported in accordance with GAAP for the given period.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Exhibit Index
 

Exhibit 99.1
VeriSign, Inc. (Nasdaq: VRSN), the trusted provider of Internet infrastructure services, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2008.
MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA  November 6, 2008 
VeriSign reported revenue of $246 million from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2008. On a GAAP basis, VeriSign reported a consolidated net loss of $200 million and a net loss per share of $1.02 on a fully-diluted basis. These GAAP results reflect a $237 million non-cash impairment charge for estimated losses on certain assets held for sale, all of which is recorded in discontinued operations. Also recorded were restructuring charges of $13 million, $7 million of which is recorded in discontinued operations related to assets held for sale.
VeriSign reported segment revenue for Internet Infrastructure and Identity Services (3IS), or the "core businesses" of Naming, SSL and IAS, of $240 million, up 3% from Q2 2008 and up 18% year over year.
On a non-GAAP basis (which excludes items described below) for our core businesses, VeriSign reported net income of $48 million for the third quarter of 2008 and fully-diluted earnings per share of $0.25, including a $0.03 write-down related to investments affected by the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. A table reconciling the GAAP to the non-GAAP results reported above is appended to this release.
"We're very pleased with our operating results this quarter, especially in light of the current market conditions," said Jim Bidzos, executive chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer on an interim basis of VeriSign. "While it's difficult to predict what will happen with the broader economy, we feel very good about the strength and stability of our core businesses. We are fortunate to be in a market leadership position with good revenue growth, expanding operating margins and backed by the strength of the VeriSign brand. As we move forward in these uncertain times, we remain focused on protecting and growing our core services for the long term."
"Third quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign with 18% year over year revenue growth and non-GAAP operating margin of 35.5%," said Brian Robins, acting chief financial officer of VeriSign. "Our non-GAAP earnings per share was strong as well after considering an unanticipated $0.03 charge related to investment losses, and we exited the quarter with a strong balance sheet and healthy cash flow of $115 million for the third quarter. As we contemplate our 2009 plan, we are realistic about the current economic environment and remain fully committed to our strategy to focus the business on our core Internet infrastructure services."
