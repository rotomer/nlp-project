(e) Executive officers of VeriSign are eligible to receive an annual performance bonus payment for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 ("Fiscal 2008") under the VeriSign Performance Plan ("VPP") based on performance against goals established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") for Fiscal 2008. At a meeting held on February 23, 2009, the Committee determined, subject to and conditional upon certification of final financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, the amounts of annual performance bonuses to be paid under the VPP based on the Committee's review with management of the performance of each eligible executive officer.
The Fiscal 2008 VPP bonus approved for Brian G. Robins, our principal financial officer was $208,500. D. James Bidzos, our chief executive officer on an interim basis, does not participate in the VPP. None of the persons designated as a "named executive officer" in our 2008 annual proxy statement received a Fiscal 2008 VPP bonus.
