(e) On April 28, 2011, VeriSign, Inc. (the "Company") announced that on April 27, 2011, its Board of Directors declared a special dividend (the "Dividend") of $2.75 per share of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock") to be paid on May 18, 2011 (the "Payment Date") to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 9, 2011 (the "Record Date"). The Company's stock declined by approximately $2.75 on the ex-dividend date.
In connection with the declaration of the Dividend, the Compensation Committee determined to grant restricted stock units ("RSUs") equal in value to the $2.75 Dividend, based on the price of the Company's common stock on the Payment Date, to employees who hold stock options outstanding under the Company's equity plans on the Record Date. For this purpose, the $37.29 stock closing price on the Payment Date was used to compute the number of RSUs to be issued, with rounding to the nearest whole share. Vested options priced below $41.00 received $2.75 worth of immediately vested RSUs per option share, reduced by the amount of RSUs withheld for tax withholding purposes. Unvested options priced below $41.00 received unvested RSUs vesting two years from the date of issuance, provided the holder continues to be employed by, or provide services to, the Company. No RSUs were issued with respect to options priced at $41.00 or above. The RSUs were granted under the Company's 2006 Equity Incentive Plan.
The Compensation Committee granted RSUs to all 196 affected employee option holders and directors serving on the Board of Directors. The table below shows the number of RSUs issued to each of the named executive officers per applicable vesting schedule.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
