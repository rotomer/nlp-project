Leverage Ratio
On November 28, 2011, the Company borrowed $100 million as a LIBOR revolving loan denominated in US dollars to be used in connection with the purchase of VeriSign's headquarters facility in Reston, Virginia, which closed on November 15, 2011, and for general corporate purposes. The remainder of the Facility remains undrawn as of the date hereof. Any other borrowings under the Facility may be used for working capital purposes, to finance acquisitions, stock repurchases, and capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes. Letters of credit will be issued for general corporate purposes.
VeriSign is required to pay the Lenders under the Credit Agreement a commitment fee at a rate per annum of between 0.2% and 0.3%, depending on VeriSign's Leverage Ratio, payable quarterly in arrears. VeriSign is also required to pay, quarterly in arrears certain fees to the Lenders in connection with the letters of credit. VeriSign is further required to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between VeriSign and the Administrative Agent.
The Facility terminates on November 22, 2016 at which time outstanding borrowings under the Facility are due. VeriSign may optionally prepay loans in whole or in part under the Credit Agreement at any time (other than Competitive Bid Loans, which shall require the prior consent of the bidding Lenders) without penalty but subject to payment of any broken-funding costs of the Lenders. VeriSign may also, at any time, terminate the commitments or permanently reduce them from time to time.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, as well as affirmative and negative covenants. Affirmative covenants include, among others, financial and other reporting requirements, provision of notices of material events, an agreement to cause future material subsidiaries (other than subsidiaries that are controlled foreign corporations for U.S. tax purposes) to become parties to the Guarantee Agreement referred to below, maintenance of existence, maintenance of intellectual property, payment of obligations, maintenance of properties, maintenance of insurance, maintenance of books and records and compliance with laws.
Negative covenants include, among others, limitations on incurrence of additional indebtedness by subsidiaries that are not borrowers or guarantors under the Credit Agreement, limitations on incurrence of liens, limitations on mergers and acquisitions, limitations on changing its business, limitations on investments, limitations on asset sales, limitations on sale/leaseback transactions, limitations on dividends, share redemptions and other restricted payments, limitations on entering into certain types of restrictive agreements, limitations on entering into hedging agreements, limitations on amendments, waivers or prepayments of certain subordinated indebtedness, limitations on transactions with affiliates and limitations on the use of proceeds from the Facility.
 
The Credit Agreement includes two financial covenants: (1) that VeriSign not permit the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be less than 3.00:1.00, and (2) that VeriSign not permit the Leverage Ratio at any time to exceed 2.00:1.00.
The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including among others, non-payment of principal, interest or other amounts when due (subject to a grace period for payment of interest and certain other amounts), inaccuracy of representations and warranties, violation of covenants, cross defaults and cross-acceleration with respect to certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy, insolvency or inability to pay debts, certain undischarged judgments, the occurrence of certain ERISA events, failure of a guarantee under the Guarantee Agreement (as defined below) to be in full force and effect, a Change of Control (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or a Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture governing VeriSign's 3.25% Junior Subordinated Convertible Debentures due 2037). Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the Credit Agreement, the Lenders may declare the loans and all other obligations under the Credit Agreement immediately due and payable and may terminate the commitments. A bankruptcy event of default causes such obligations automatically to become immediately due and payable and the commitments automatically to terminate.
VeriSign may from time to time request Lenders to agree on a discretionary basis to increase the Commitment Amount by up to an aggregate of $150 million during the term of the Facility.
The obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by VeriSign and its material subsidiaries (other than subsidiaries that are controlled foreign corporations for U.S. tax purposes) pursuant to a guarantee agreement, dated as of November 22, 2011 (the ""), among VeriSign, the other guarantors identified therein, and the Administrative Agent.

Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from a Borrower (or other Person on behalf of such Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by

Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for an LC Disbursement (other than the funding of an ABR Revolving Borrowing or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve any Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.

None of the Agents, the Lenders, the Issuing Banks or any of their Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit, any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any other act, failure to act or other event or circumstance; that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrowers to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrowers that are caused by such Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or wilful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank (with such absence to be presumed unless otherwise determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and nonappealable judgment), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, an Issuing Bank may, in its sole

Any such termination shall become effective upon the earlier of (i) such Issuing Bank acknowledging receipt of such notice and (ii) the 10th Business Day following the date of the delivery thereof; that no such termination shall become effective until and unless the LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank (or its Affiliates) shall have been reduced to zero. At the time any such termination shall become effective, the Borrowers shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the terminated Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b). Notwithstanding the effectiveness of any such termination, the terminated Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such termination, but shall not issue any additional Letters of Credit.

SECTION 2.07. (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds in the applicable currency by 1:30 p.m., Local Time, to the account of the Applicable Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.05.

(b) Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Applicable Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Applicable Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance on such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in
 
fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Applicable Agent, then the applicable Lender and such Borrower severally agree to pay to the Applicable Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Applicable Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the rate determined by the Applicable Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (which determination will be conclusive absent manifest error) or (ii) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the subject Loan pursuant to Section 2.13. If such Lender pays such amount to the Applicable Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.
SECTION 2.08. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type and, in the case of a LIBOR Borrowing or a EURIBOR Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in the applicable Borrowing Request or as otherwise provided in Section 2.03.

A Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of an affected Revolving Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Revolving Borrowing and the Loans resulting from an election made with respect to any such portion shall be considered a separate Revolving Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings or Competitive Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, no Borrower shall be permitted to change the currency of any Revolving Borrowing or elect an Interest Period for a LIBOR Revolving Borrowing or a EURIBOR Revolving Borrowing that does not comply with Section 2.02(d).
Interest Elections.
(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the applicable Borrower (or the Company on its behalf) shall notify the Applicable Agent of such election by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type and in the currency resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such election shall be made by hand delivery or facsimile, if applicable, to the Applicable Agent of an executed written Interest Election Request (or, in the case of any Borrowing denominated in US Dollars, by telephone notification, confirmed promptly by hand delivery or facsimile to the Applicable Agent of an executed written Interest Election Request). Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i) the Revolving Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Revolving Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Revolving Borrowing);
 
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii) the Type of the resulting Revolving Borrowing; and
(iv) if the resulting Revolving Borrowing is to be a LIBOR Revolving Borrowing or a EURIBOR Revolving Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a LIBOR Revolving Borrowing or EURIBOR Revolving Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
(c) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request in accordance with this Section, the Applicable Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Revolving Borrowing.
(d) If the applicable Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a LIBOR Revolving Borrowing or EURIBOR Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period, (i) in the case of a LIBOR Revolving Borrowing denominated in US Dollars, such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Revolving Borrowing and (ii) in the case of any other LIBOR Revolving Borrowing or a EURIBOR Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be continued as a Revolving Borrowing of the applicable Type for an Interest Period of one month.
(e) Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default under clause (h) or (i) of Article VIII has occurred and is continuing with respect to any Borrower, or if any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Majority in Interest of the Lenders, has notified the Company of the election to give effect to this sentence on account of such other Event of Default, then, in each such case, so long as such Event of Default is continuing, (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing denominated in US Dollars may be converted to or continued as a LIBOR Revolving Borrowing, (ii) unless repaid, each LIBOR Revolving Borrowing denominated in US Dollars shall be converted to an ABR Revolving Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and (iii) unless repaid, each LIBOR Revolving Borrowing or EURIBOR Revolving Borrowing denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be continued as a LIBOR Revolving Borrowing or EURIBOR Revolving Borrowing, as applicable, with an Interest Period of one month's duration.
SECTION 2.09. (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall automatically terminate on the Maturity Date.

Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination or reduction of the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section may state that such notice is conditioned upon the occurrence of one or more events specified therein, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.

Alternate Rate of Interest.
(a) the Applicable Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate, the LIBO Rate or the Adjusted EURIBO Rate, as the case may be, for such Interest Period; or
(b) the Applicable Agent is advised by a Majority in Interest of the Lenders (or, in the case of a Competitive Borrowing, the applicable Lender) that the Adjusted LIBO Rate, the LIBO Rate or the Adjusted EURIBO Rate, as the case may be, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining the Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Applicable Agent shall give notice (which may be telephonic) thereof to the applicable Borrower and the Lenders as promptly as practicable and, until the Applicable Agent notifies the applicable Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, an affected LIBOR Revolving Borrowing or EURIBOR Revolving Borrowing, as the case may be, shall be ineffective, (ii) any affected LIBOR Revolving Borrowing or EURIBOR Revolving Borrowing that is requested to be continued shall (A) if denominated in US Dollars, be continued as an ABR Revolving Borrowing, or (B) otherwise, be repaid on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto and (iii) any Borrowing Request for an affected LIBOR Revolving Borrowing or EURIBOR Revolving Borrowing, and any request for a LIBOR Competitive Borrowing, shall (A) in the case of a Revolving Borrowing denominated in US Dollars, be deemed a request for an ABR Borrowing, or (B) in all other cases, be ineffective (and no Lender shall be obligated to make a Loan on account thereof).
SECTION 2.15. (a) If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs.
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the Adjusted EURIBO Rate) or any Issuing Bank;
(ii) impose on any Lender, any Issuing Bank or the London or European interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or LIBOR Loans, EURIBOR Loans or Competitive Loans or any Letter of Credit or participations therein; or
 
(iii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of the term "Excluded Taxes" and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or other Recipient of making or maintaining any LIBOR Loan, EURIBOR Loan or Competitive Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), to increase the cost to such Lender, Issuing Bank or other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or issue any Letter of Credit) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, Issuing Bank or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then, from time to time upon request of such Lender, Issuing Bank or other Recipient, the Company will pay to such Lender, Issuing Bank or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, Issuing Bank or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs or expenses incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has had or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then, from time to time upon request of such Lender or Issuing Bank, the Company will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) If the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining any Loan or the cost to any Lender or any Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit to a Borrowing Subsidiary is increased (or the amount of any sum received or receivable by any Lender or any Issuing Bank (or its applicable lending office) is reduced) by reason of the fact that such Borrowing Subsidiary is incorporated in, has its principal place of business in, or borrows from, a jurisdiction outside the United States of America, such Borrowing Subsidiary shall indemnify such Lender or such Issuing Bank from time to time for such increased cost or reduction.
(d) A certificate of a Lender or Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section delivered to the Company shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company shall pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
 
(e) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; that the Company shall not be required to compensate a Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or expenses incurred or reductions suffered more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law or other circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or expenses or reductions and of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the Change in Law or other circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or expenses or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

further
(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, no Lender shall demand compensation for any increased cost or reduction pursuant to this Section if it shall not at the time be the general policy or practice of such Lender to demand such compensation in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other credit agreements.
SECTION 2.16. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any LIBOR Loan, EURIBOR Loan or Fixed Rate Competitive Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any LIBOR Loan or EURIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Revolving Loan on the date or in the amount specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (whether or not such notice may be revoked in accordance with the terms hereof), (d) the failure to borrow any Competitive Loan after accepting the Competitive Bid to make such Loan or (e) the assignment of any LIBOR Loan or EURIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Company shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense (but not for any anticipated profits) attributable to such event including, to the extent that any of the foregoing Loans are denominated in any Alternative Currency, the actual costs and expenses of such Lender attributable to the premature unwinding of any hedging agreement entered into by such Lender in respect to the foreign currency exposure attributable to such Loan. In the case of a LIBOR Loan or EURIBOR Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate, LIBO Rate or Adjusted EURIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan (and, for avoidance of doubt, without giving effect to any Applicable Rate or Margin that would otherwise have been applicable thereto), for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest that
Break Funding Payments.
 
would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in the applicable currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the London or European interbank market. The Company shall also compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to any failure by any Borrower to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a LIBOR Revolving Loan. A certificate of any Lender delivered to the Company setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
SECTION 2.17. (a)  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a withholding agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
Taxes.
Payments Free of Taxes.
(b) The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for, Other Taxes.
Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrowers.
(c) As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
Evidence of Payments.
(d) The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Indemnification by the Loan Parties.
 
(e) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.04(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph.
Indemnification by the Lenders.
(f) (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent at the time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding; that, other than in the case of U.S. Federal withholding Taxes, such Lender has received written notice from the Company advising it of the availability of such exemption or reduction and containing all applicable documentation (together, if requested by such Lender, with a certified English translation thereof). In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.17(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender's reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
Status of Lenders.
provided
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the applicable Borrower is a U.S. Person:
(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender
 
becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. Federal backup withholding tax;
(B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
(1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the "interest" article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the "business profits" or "other income" article of such tax treaty;
(2) executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;
(3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit I-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a "10 percent shareholder" of the applicable Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a "controlled foreign corporation" described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a "") and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN; or
U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate
(4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit I-2 or Exhibit I-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit I-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
provided
 
(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. Federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Company and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(g) If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such
Treatment of Certain Refunds.
 
indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
(h) For purposes of this Section, the term "Lender" includes any Issuing Bank.
Issuing Bank.
SECTION 2.18. (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Documents prior to the time expressly required hereunder or under such other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 1:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date when due), in immediately available funds, without any defense, setoff, recoupment or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Applicable Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Applicable Agent to such account as the Applicable Agent shall from time to time specify in one or more notices delivered to the Company, except that payments required to be made directly to any Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender shall be so made, payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein. The Applicable Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder of principal or interest in respect of any Loan or LC Disbursement shall, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, be made in the currency of such Loan or LC Disbursement; all other payments hereunder and under each other Loan Document shall be made in US Dollars. Any payment required to be made by any Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if such Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by such Agent to make such payment.
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs.
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Agents to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied towards payment of the amounts then due hereunder ratably among the parties entitled thereto, in accordance with the amounts then due to such parties.
 
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the amount of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amounts of principal of and accrued interest on their Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, as in effect from time to time) or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans to any Person that is an Eligible Assignee (as such term is defined from time to time). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrowers rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrowers in the amount of such participation.
provided
(d) Unless an Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to such Agent for the account of any Lenders or Issuing Banks hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, such Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders or Issuing Banks, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the applicable Lenders or Issuing Banks, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to such Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to such Agent, at the rate determined by such Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (which determination will be conclusive absent manifest error).
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it hereunder to or for the account of any Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations in respect of such
 
payment until all such unsatisfied obligations have been discharged or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender pursuant to Sections 2.05(c), 2.06(d), 2.06(f), 2.07(b), 2.18(d) and 9.03(c), in each case in such order as shall be determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
(f) In the event that any financial statements delivered under Section 5.01(a) or 5.01(b), or any Compliance Certificate delivered under Section 5.01(c), shall prove to have been materially inaccurate, and such inaccuracy shall have resulted in the payment of any interest or fees at rates lower than those that were in fact applicable for any period (based on the actual Leverage Ratio), then, if such inaccuracy is discovered prior to the termination of the Commitments and the repayment in full of the principal of all Loans and the reduction of the LC Exposure to zero, the Borrowers shall pay to the Applicable Agent, for distribution to the Lenders (or former Lenders) as their interests may appear, the accrued interest or fees that should have been paid but were not paid as a result of such misstatement.
SECTION 2.19. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrowers are required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or to any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall (at the request of the Company) use commercially reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign and delegate its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment and delegation (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment and delegation.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, (ii) any Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, (iii) any Lender has become a Defaulting Lender or (iv) any Lender has failed to consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or termination that under Section 9.02 requires the consent of all the Lenders (or all the affected Lenders) and with respect to which the Required Lenders shall have granted their consent, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights (other than any outstanding Competitive Loans held by it) and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (or, in the case of any such assignment and delegation resulting from a failure to provide a consent, all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as a Lender) to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment and delegation); that (A) the Company shall have received the prior
provided
 
written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, in circumstances where its consent would be required under Section 9.04, each Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (B) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans (other than Competitive Loans) and, if applicable, participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (in the case of such principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts), (C) in the case of any such assignment and delegation resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and (D) in the case of any such assignment and delegation resulting from the failure to provide a consent, the assignee shall have given such consent and, as a result of such assignment and delegation and any contemporaneous assignments and delegations and consents, the applicable amendment, waiver, discharge or termination can be effected. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver or consent by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation have ceased to apply. Each party hereto agrees that an assignment and delegation required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Company, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and that the Lender required to make such assignment and delegation need not be a party thereto.
SECTION 2.20. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
Defaulting Lenders.
(a) facility fees shall continue to accrue on the amount of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(a) only to the extent of the Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender (excluding any portion thereof constituting Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender that is subject to reallocation under clause (c)(i) below);
(b) the Commitment, the Revolving Credit Exposure and the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Competitive Loans of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders or any other requisite Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 9.02); that any amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or all Lenders affected thereby shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 9.02, require the consent of such Defaulting Lender in accordance with the terms hereof;
provided
 
(c) if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(i) the Swingline Exposure (other than any portion thereof with respect to which such Defaulting Lender shall have funded its participation as contemplated by Section 2.05(c)) and LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender (other than any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements with respect to which such Defaulting Lender shall have funded its participation as contemplated by Sections 2.06(d) and 2.06(f)) shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent that the sum of all Non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender's Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure (in each case, excluding the portion thereof referred to above) does not exceed the sum of all Non-Defaulting Lenders' Commitments;
(ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (A) first, prepay the portion of such Defaulting Lender's Swingline Exposure that has not been reallocated as set forth in such clause and (B) second, cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Banks the portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure that has not been reallocated as set forth in such clause in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.06(i) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;
(iii) if the Borrowers cash collateralize any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrowers shall not be required to pay participation fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(b) with respect to such portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure for so long as such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is cash collateralized;
(iv) if any portion of the LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.12(b) shall be adjusted to give effect to such reallocation;
(v) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's Swingline Exposure that is subject to reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above is neither reallocated nor reduced pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Swingline Lender or any other Lender hereunder, all facility fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such portion of its Swingline Exposure shall be payable to the Swingline Lender until and to the extent that such Swingline Exposure is reallocated and/or reduced to zero; and
 
(vi) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure that is subject to reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any other Lender hereunder, all facility fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such portion of its LC Exposure, and all participation fees payable under Section 2.12(b) with respect to such portion of its LC Exposure, shall be payable to the Issuing Banks (and allocated among them ratably based on the amount of such portion of the LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender attributable to Letters of Credit issued by each Issuing Bank) until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and
(d) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, unless, in each case, it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender's then outstanding Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure, as applicable, will be fully covered by the Commitments of the Non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral provided by the Borrowers in accordance with clause (c) above, and participating interests in any such funded Swingline Loan or in any such issued, amended, renewed or extended Letter of Credit will be allocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with clause (c)(i) above (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
In the event that (x) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a Lender Parent shall have occurred following the date hereof and for so long as such Bankruptcy Event shall continue or (y) the Swingline Lender or any Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan, and such Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, unless the Swingline Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrowers or the applicable Lender satisfactory to the Swingline Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder.
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Company, the Swingline Lender and each Issuing Bank each agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Revolving Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.

(g) any event or condition occurs that results in any Material Indebtedness becoming due prior to its scheduled maturity or that enables or permits (all the periods of grace, if any, applicable thereto having lapsed, but with or without the giving of notice) the holder or holders of any Material Indebtedness or any trustee or agent on its or their behalf, or, in the case of any Hedging Agreement, the applicable counterparty, to cause such Material Indebtedness to become due, or to require the prepayment, repurchase, redemption or defeasance thereof, prior to its scheduled maturity or, in the case of any Hedging Agreement, to cause the termination thereof; that this clause (g) shall not apply to (i) any secured Indebtedness that becomes due as a result of the voluntary sale or transfer of the assets securing such Indebtedness or (ii) any Indebtedness that becomes due as a result of a voluntary refinancing thereof permitted under Section 6.01;
provided

Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent and the London Agent as its agents and authorizes the Administrative Agent and the London Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent or the London Agent, as applicable, by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
 
Any Person serving as an Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender or an Issuing Bank as any other Lender or Issuing Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not an Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks.
No Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Agents shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Agents shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or to exercise any discretionary power, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that an Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as such Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in the Loan Documents), that an Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion, could expose such Agent to liability or be contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Agents shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company, any Subsidiary or any other Affiliate of the Company that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as an Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. No Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as such Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in the Loan Documents) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or wilful misconduct (such absence to be presumed unless otherwise determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and non-appealable judgment). Each Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof (stating that it is a "notice of default") is given to such Agent by the Company, a Lender or an Issuing Bank, and the Agents shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the sufficiency, validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to such Agent or satisfaction of any condition that expressly refers to the matters described therein being acceptable or satisfactory to an Agent. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Agent shall have any liability arising from any confirmation of the Revolving Credit Exposure or the component amounts thereof.
provided
 
Each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall not incur any liability for relying, upon any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person (whether or not such Person in fact meets the requirements set forth in the Loan Documents for being the signatory, sender or authenticator thereof). Each Agent also shall be entitled to rely, and shall not incur any liability for relying, upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person (whether or not such Person in fact meets the requirements set forth in the Loan Documents for being the signatory, sender or authenticator thereof), and may act upon any such statement prior to receipt of written confirmation thereof. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
Each Agent may perform any of and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by such Agent. Each Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any of and all their duties and exercise their rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of each Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as an Agent.
Subject to the terms of this paragraph, each Agent may resign at any time from its capacity as such. In connection with such resignation, such Agent shall give notice of its intent to resign to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Company. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders (in the case of a resignation by the Administrative Agent) or the Administrative Agent (in the case of a resignation by the London Agent) shall have the right, in consultation with the Company, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its intent to resign, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, in the case of a successor to the Administrative Agent, or with an office in London, in the case of a successor to the London Agent, or, in each case, an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent or London Agent, as applicable, hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. The fees payable by the Company to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed by the Company and such successor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event no successor Agent shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its intent to resign, the retiring Agent may give notice of the effectiveness of its resignation to the Lenders, the Issuing
 
Banks and the Company, whereupon, on the date of effectiveness of such resignation stated in such notice, (a) the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and (b) the Required Lenders shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent; that (i) all payments required to be made hereunder or under any other Loan Document to the retiring Agent for the account of any Person other than such Agent shall be made directly to such Person and (ii) all notices and other communications required or contemplated to be given or made to the retiring Agent shall also directly be given or made to the other Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank. Following the effectiveness of an Agent's resignation from its capacity as such, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03, as well as any exculpatory, reimbursement and indemnification provisions set forth in any other Loan Document, shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as an Agent.
provided
Each Lender and Issuing Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agents, the Arranger or any other Lender or Issuing Bank, or any of the Related Parties of any of the foregoing, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agents, the Arranger or any other Lender or Issuing Bank, or any of the Related Parties of any of the foregoing, and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
Each Lender, by delivering its signature page to this Agreement, or delivering its signature page to an Assignment and Assumption or an Accession Agreement pursuant to which it shall become a Lender hereunder, shall be deemed to have acknowledged receipt of, and consented to and approved, each Loan Document and each other document required to be delivered to, or be approved by or satisfactory to, any Agent or the Lenders on the Effective Date.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the Arranger nor any Person named on the cover page of this Agreement as a Syndication Agent shall have any duties or obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except in its capacity, as applicable, as a Lender or an Issuing Bank), but all such Persons shall have the benefit of the indemnities provided for hereunder.
The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Agents, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, and none of the Company or any other Loan Party shall have any rights as a third party beneficiary of any such provisions.

SECTION 9.02. (a) No failure or delay by any Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agents, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the making of a Loan or the issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether any Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
Waivers; Amendments.
(b) None of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Company, the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders and, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders; that (i) any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document may be amended by an agreement in writing entered into by the Company and the Administrative Agent to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency so long as, in each case, (A) such amendment does not adversely affect the rights of any Lender or (B) the Lenders shall have received at least five Business Days' prior written notice thereof and the Administrative Agent shall not have received, within five Business Days of the date of such notice to the Lenders, a written notice from the Required Lenders stating that the Required Lenders object to such amendment and (ii) no such agreement shall (A) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (B) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon (other than as a result of any change in the definition, or in any components thereof, of the term "Leverage Ratio"), or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected
provided
 
thereby, (C) postpone the scheduled maturity date of any Loan, or the required date of reimbursement of any LC Disbursement, or any date for the payment of any interest or fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (D) change Section 2.18(b) or 2.18(c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of each Lender, (E) change any of the provisions of this Section or the percentage set forth in the definition of the term "Required Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder (including any such provisions set forth in the definition of the term "Alternative Currency"), without the written consent of each Lender, and (F) release (including by limiting liability in respect thereof) (i) the Company from its Guarantee under the Guarantee Agreement or (ii) one or more Subsidiary Loan Parties from their Guarantees under the Guarantee Agreement if such Guarantees represent a material portion of the aggregate value of the Guarantees of all the Subsidiary Loan Parties (except as expressly provided in Section 9.18 or in the Guarantee Agreement), without the written consent of each Lender; that no such agreement shall amend, modify, extend or otherwise affect the rights or obligations of any Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender without the prior written consent of such Agent, such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no consent with respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification of this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be required of (x) any Defaulting Lender, except with respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of the first proviso of this paragraph and then only in the event such Defaulting Lender shall be affected by such amendment, waiver or other modification or (y) in the case of any amendment, waiver or other modification referred to in clause (ii) of the first proviso of this paragraph, any Lender that receives payment in full of the principal of and interest accrued on each Loan made by, and all other amounts owing to, such Lender or accrued for the account of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents at the time such amendment, waiver or other modification becomes effective and whose Commitments terminate by the terms and upon the effectiveness of such amendment, waiver or other modification.
provided
further
(c) The Administrative Agent may, but shall have no obligation to, with the concurrence of any Lender, execute amendments, waivers or other modifications on behalf of such Lender.

(b) The Borrowers shall indemnify each Agent (and any sub-agent thereof), the Arranger, each Syndication Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an ""), against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the structuring, arrangement and the syndication of the credit facility provided for herein, the preparation, execution, delivery and administration of the Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties to the Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents of their obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by any Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or Release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property currently owned or operated by the Company or any Subsidiary, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Company or any Subsidiary, or (iv) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and whether initiated against or by any party to the Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any Affiliate of any of the foregoing or any third party (and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto); that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith, or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee. This paragraph shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims or damages arising from any non-Tax claim.
Indemnitee
provided
 
(c) To the extent that the Borrowers fail to pay any amount required to be paid by them under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section to any Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), any Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to such Agent (or any such sub-agent), such Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender's pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against such Agent (or such sub-agent), such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for such Agent (or any such sub-agent), any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender in connection with such capacity.

No Limitations
 
(b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Borrower or any other Loan Party or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Borrower or any other Loan Party (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations).

Section 2.04. Each Guarantor agrees that its guarantee hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Administrative Agent or any other Guaranteed Party upon the bankruptcy or reorganization (or any analogous proceeding in any jurisdiction) of the Company, any other Loan Party or otherwise.

In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that the Administrative Agent or any other Guaranteed Party may have at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Borrowers or any other Loan Party to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent for distribution to the applicable Guaranteed Parties in cash the amount of such unpaid Obligation. Each Guarantor agrees that if payment in respect of any Obligation shall be due in a currency other than US Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any change in law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, circumstance or condition, payment of such Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of the Administrative Agent, such Guarantor shall make payment of such Obligation in US Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each other Guaranteed Party against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment. Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums to the Administrative Agent as provided above, all rights of such Guarantor against any Borrower or any other Loan Party arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subject to Article III.
Agreement to Pay; Subrogation

Information
Section 2.07. Each Guarantor that is not a party to the Credit Agreement hereby acknowledges the provisions of Section 2.17 of the Credit Agreement and agrees to be bound by such provisions with the same force and effect, and to the same extent, as if such Guarantor were a party to the Credit Agreement.
Payments Free of Taxes
Section 3.01. In addition to all such rights of indemnity and subrogation as the Guarantors may have under applicable law (but subject to Section 3.03), each Borrower agrees that (a) in the event a payment in respect of any Obligation of such Borrower shall be made by any Guarantor under this Agreement, such Borrower shall indemnify such Guarantor for the full amount of such payment and such Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the Person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such payment and (b) in the event any assets of any Guarantor shall be sold pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document to satisfy in whole or in part any Obligation of such Borrower, such Borrower shall indemnify such Guarantor in an amount equal to the greater of the book value or the fair market value of the assets so sold.
Indemnity and Subrogation
Section 3.02 . Each Guarantor (a "") agrees (subject to Section 3.03) that, in the event a payment shall be made by any other Guarantor (other than a payment by any Borrower of its Obligations under the Credit Agreement) hereunder in respect of any Obligations or assets of any other Guarantor (other than the Company) shall be sold pursuant to any Loan Document to satisfy any Obligation (other than any such sale of assets of any Borrower to satisfy its Obligations under the Credit Agreement) and such other Guarantor (the "") shall not have been fully indemnified by the Borrowers as provided in Section 3.01, the Contributing Party shall indemnify the Claiming Party in an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the greater of the book value or the fair market value of such assets, as the case may be, in each case multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the net worth of the Contributing Party on the date hereof and the denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 5.12,
Contribution and Subrogation

Claiming Party
 
the date of the Supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor). Any Contributing Party making any payment to a Claiming Party pursuant to this Section 3.02 shall (subject to Section 3.03) be subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Party under Section 3.01 to the extent of such payment.
Section 3.03 . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, all rights of the Guarantors under Sections 3.01 and 3.02 and all other rights of the Guarantors of indemnity, contribution or subrogation under applicable law or otherwise shall be fully subordinated to the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations. No failure on the part of any Borrower or any Guarantor to make the payments required by Sections 3.01 and 3.02 (or any other payments required under applicable law or otherwise) shall in any respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor with respect to its obligations hereunder, and each Guarantor shall remain liable for the full amount of the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder.
Subordination
Each Guarantor represents and warrants that (a) the execution, delivery and performance by such Guarantor of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other action and, if required, action by the holders of such Guarantor's Equity Interests, and that this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such Guarantor and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law, and (b) all representations and warranties set forth in the Credit Agreement as to such Guarantor (if such Guarantor is not a party to the Credit Agreement) are true and correct.
Section 5.01. All communications and notices hereunder shall (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein) be in writing and given as provided in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement. All communications and notices hereunder to any Subsidiary Guarantor shall be given to it in care of the Company as provided in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement.
Notices
Section 5.02 . (a) No failure or delay by any Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
Waivers; Amendment
 
exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agents, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the making of a Loan or the issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether any Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. No notice or demand on any Loan Party in any case shall entitle any Loan Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

Very truly yours,
 
 
EXHIBIT H
1. The Mandatory Costs Rate is an addition to the interest rate to compensate Lenders for the cost of compliance with (a) the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority (or, in either case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) or (b) the requirements of the European Central Bank, in each case, solely in respect of Loans made to the Borrowing Subsidiaries organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States.
2. On the first day of each Interest Period (or as soon as possible thereafter) the Administrative Agent shall calculate, as a percentage rate, a rate (the "") for each Lender, in accordance with the paragraphs set out below. The Mandatory Costs Rate will be calculated by the Administrative Agent as a weighted average of the Lenders' Additional Cost Rates (weighted in proportion to the percentage participation of each Lender in the relevant Borrowings) and will be expressed as a percentage rate per annum. The Administrative Agent will, at the request of the Company, deliver to the Company a statement setting forth the calculation of any Mandatory Costs Rate.
Additional Cost Rate
3. The Additional Cost Rate for any Lender lending from a lending office in a member state of the European Community that adopts or has adopted the Euro as its lawful currency in accordance with legislation of the European Community relating to Economic and Monetary Union will be the percentage notified by such Lender to the Administrative Agent. This percentage will be certified by such Lender in its notice to the Administrative Agent to be its reasonable determination of the cost (expressed as a percentage of that Lender's participation in the relevant Borrowing made from such lending office) of complying with the minimum reserve requirements of the European Central Bank in respect of Loans made from such lending office.
4. The Additional Cost Rate for any Lender lending from a lending office in the United Kingdom will be calculated by the Administrative Agent as follows:
(a) in relation to a Loan denominated in Sterling:
 
(b) in relation to a Loan denominated in any currency other than Sterling:
 
Where:
A is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (assuming these to be in excess of any stated minimum) which such Lender is from time to time required to maintain as an interest free cash ratio deposit with the Bank of England to comply with cash ratio requirements.
B is the percentage rate of interest (excluding the Applicable Rate and the Mandatory Costs Rate and any additional rate of interest specified in Section 2.13(e) of the Credit Agreement payable for the relevant Interest Period on the Loan.
C is the percentage (if any) of Eligible Liabilities which such Lender is required from time to time to maintain as interest bearing Special Deposits with the Bank of England.
D is the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of England to the Administrative Agent on interest bearing Special Deposits.
E is designed to compensate Lenders for amounts payable under the Fees Rules and is calculated by the Administrative Agent as being the average of the most recent rates of charge supplied by the Reference Banks to the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph 7 below and expressed in pounds per 1,000,000.
5. For the purposes of this Schedule:
(a) "" and "" have the meanings given to them from time to time under or pursuant to the Bank of England Act 1998 or (as may be appropriate) by the Bank of England;
Eligible Liabilities
Special Deposits
(b) "" means the rules on periodic fees contained in the Financial Services Authority Fees Manual or such other law or regulation as may be in force from time to time in respect of the payment of fees for the acceptance of deposits;
Fees Rules
(c) "" means the fee tariffs specified in the Fees Rules under the activity group A.1 Deposit acceptors (ignoring any minimum fee or zero rated fee required pursuant to the Fees Rules but taking into account any applicable discount rate); and
Fee Tariffs
(d) "" has the meaning given to it in, and will be calculated in accordance with, the Fees Rules.
Tariff Base
6. In application of the above formulae, A, B, C and D will be included in the formulae as percentages (i.e., 5% will be included in the formula as 5 and not as 0.05). A negative result obtained by subtracting D from B shall be taken as zero. The resulting figures shall be rounded to four decimal places.
7. If requested by the Administrative Agent, each Reference Bank shall, as soon as practicable after publication by the Financial Services Authority, supply to the Administrative Agent, the rate of charge payable by such Reference Bank to the Financial Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Rules in respect of the relevant financial year of the Financial Services Authority (calculated for this purpose by such Reference Bank as being the average of the Fee Tariffs applicable to that Reference Bank for that financial year) and expressed in pounds per 1,000,000 of the Tariff Base of such Reference Bank.
8. Each Lender shall supply any information required by the Administrative Agent for the purpose of calculating its Additional Cost Rate. In particular, but without limitation, each Lender shall supply the following information on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Lender:
(a) the jurisdiction of its applicable lending office; and
 
(b) any other information that the Administrative Agent may reasonably require for such purpose.
Each Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of any change to the information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph.
9. The percentages of each Lender for the purpose of A and C above and the rates of charge of each Reference Bank for the purpose of E above shall be determined by the Administrative Agent based upon the information supplied to it pursuant to paragraphs 7 and 8 above and on the assumption that, unless a Lender notifies the Administrative Agent to the contrary, each Lender's obligations in relation to cash ratio deposits and Special Deposits are the same as those of a typical bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with a lending office in the same jurisdiction as such Lender's applicable lending office.
10. The Administrative Agent shall have no liability to any Person if such determination results in an Additional Cost Rate which over or under compensates any Lender and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by any Lender or any Reference Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above is true and correct in all respects.
11. The Administrative Agent shall distribute the additional amounts received as a result of the Mandatory Costs Rate to the Lenders on the basis of the Additional Cost Rate for each Lender based on the information provided by each Lender and each Reference Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above.
12. Any determination by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Schedule in relation to a formula, the Mandatory Costs Rate, an Additional Cost Rate or any amount payable to a Lender shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties to this Agreement.
13. The Administrative Agent may from time to time, after consultation with the Company and the Lenders, determine and notify to all parties to this Agreement any amendments which are required to be made to this Schedule in order to comply with any change in law, regulation or any requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank (or, in any case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) and any such determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties to this Agreement.

Each Guarantor further agrees that the Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, or amended or modified, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any extension, renewal, amendment or modification of any of the Obligations. Each Guarantor waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Borrower or any other Loan Party of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its Guarantee and notice of protest for nonpayment.
Guarantee
SECTION 2.02. . Each Guarantor further agrees that its guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent or any other Guaranteed Party to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party in favor of any Borrowers, any other Loan Party or any other Person. Each Guarantor agrees that its guarantee hereunder is continuing in nature and applies to all of the Obligations, whether currently existing or hereafter incurred.
Guarantee of Payment; Continuing Guarantee
SECTION 2.03. . (a) Except for the termination or release of a Guarantor's obligations hereunder as expressly provided in Section 5.12, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise of any of the Obligations, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of any of the Obligations, or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except for termination or release of its obligations hereunder as expressly provided in Section 5.12, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by (i) the failure of the Administrative Agent or any other Guaranteed Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy under the provisions of any Loan Document or otherwise, (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment, or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, any Loan Document or any other agreement, including with respect to any other Guarantor under this Agreement, (iii) any default, failure or delay, wilful or otherwise, in the performance of any of the Obligations or (iv) any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations).
No Limitations
 
(b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Borrower or any other Loan Party or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Borrower or any other Loan Party (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations). The Administrative Agent and the other Guaranteed Parties may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with any Borrower or any other Loan Party or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against any Borrower or any other Loan Party, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder (except to the extent the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash). To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against any Borrower or any other Loan Party, as the case may be, or any security.
SECTION 2.04. . Each Guarantor agrees that its guarantee hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Administrative Agent or any other Guaranteed Party upon the bankruptcy or reorganization (or any analogous proceeding in any jurisdiction) of the Company, any other Loan Party or otherwise.
Reinstatement
SECTION 2.05. . In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that the Administrative Agent or any other Guaranteed Party may have at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Borrowers or any other Loan Party to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent for distribution to the applicable Guaranteed Parties in cash the amount of such unpaid Obligation. Each Guarantor agrees that if payment in respect of any Obligation shall be due in a currency other than US Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any change in law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, circumstance or condition, payment of such Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of the Administrative Agent, such Guarantor shall make payment of such Obligation in US Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each other Guaranteed Party against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment. Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums to the Administrative Agent as provided above, all rights of such Guarantor against any Borrower or any other Loan Party arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subject to Article III.
Agreement to Pay; Subrogation
 
SECTION 2.06. . Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each Borrower's and each other Loan Party's financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any other Guaranteed Party will have any duty to advise such Guarantor of information known to it or any of them regarding such circumstances or risks.
Information
SECTION 2.07. . Each Guarantor that is not a party to the Credit Agreement hereby acknowledges the provisions of Section 2.17 of the Credit Agreement and agrees to be bound by such provisions with the same force and effect, and to the same extent, as if such Guarantor were a party to the Credit Agreement.
Payments Free of Taxes
SECTION 3.01. . In addition to all such rights of indemnity and subrogation as the Guarantors may have under applicable law (but subject to Section 3.03), each Borrower agrees that (a) in the event a payment in respect of any Obligation of such Borrower shall be made by any Guarantor under this Agreement, such Borrower shall indemnify such Guarantor for the full amount of such payment and such Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the Person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such payment and (b) in the event any assets of any Guarantor shall be sold pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document to satisfy in whole or in part any Obligation of such Borrower, such Borrower shall indemnify such Guarantor in an amount equal to the greater of the book value or the fair market value of the assets so sold.
Indemnity and Subrogation
SECTION 3.02. . Each Guarantor (a "") agrees (subject to Section 3.03) that, in the event a payment shall be made by any other Guarantor (other than a payment by any Borrower of its Obligations under the Credit Agreement) hereunder in respect of any Obligations or assets of any other Guarantor (other than the Company) shall be sold pursuant to any Loan Document to satisfy any Obligation (other than any such sale of assets of any Borrower to satisfy its Obligations under the Credit Agreement) and such other Guarantor (the "") shall not have been fully indemnified by the Borrowers as provided in Section 3.01, the Contributing Party shall indemnify the Claiming Party in an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the greater of the book value or the fair market value of such assets, as the case may be, in each case multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the net worth of the Contributing Party on the date hereof and the denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 5.12, the date of the Supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor). Any
Contribution and Subrogation
Contributing Party
Claiming Party
 
Contributing Party making any payment to a Claiming Party pursuant to this Section 3.02 shall (subject to Section 3.03) be subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Party under Section 3.01 to the extent of such payment.
SECTION 3.03. . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, all rights of the Guarantors under Sections 3.01 and 3.02 and all other rights of the Guarantors of indemnity, contribution or subrogation under applicable law or otherwise shall be fully subordinated to the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations. No failure on the part of any Borrower or any Guarantor to make the payments required by Sections 3.01 and 3.02 (or any other payments required under applicable law or otherwise) shall in any respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor with respect to its obligations hereunder, and each Guarantor shall remain liable for the full amount of the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder.
Subordination
Each Guarantor represents and warrants that (a) the execution, delivery and performance by such Guarantor of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other action and, if required, action by the holders of such Guarantor's Equity Interests, and that this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such Guarantor and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law, and (b) all representations and warranties set forth in the Credit Agreement as to such Guarantor (if such Guarantor is not a party to the Credit Agreement) are true and correct.

Notices
SECTION 5.02. . (a) No failure or delay by any Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agents, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are
Waivers; Amendment
 
cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the making of a Loan or the issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether any Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. No notice or demand on any Loan Party in any case shall entitle any Loan Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
(b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Guarantor or Guarantors with respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification is to apply, subject to any consent required in accordance with Section 9.02 of the Credit Agreement.

(a) Each Guarantor that is not a party to the Credit Agreement, jointly with each other such Guarantor and severally, agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent for its fees and expenses incurred hereunder as provided in Section 9.03(a) of the Credit Agreement as if each reference in such Section to "the Borrowers" were a reference to "the Guarantors" and with the same force and effect as if such Guarantor were a party to the Credit Agreement.
Administrative Agent's Fees and Expenses; Indemnification
(b) Each Guarantor that is not a party to the Credit Agreement, jointly with each other such Guarantor and severally, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee as provided in Section 9.03(b) of the Credit Agreement as if each reference in such Section to "the Borrowers" were a reference to "the Guarantors" and with the same force and effect as if such Guarantor were a party to the Credit Agreement.
(c) All amounts due under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor.
(d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Guarantor shall assert, or permit any of its Affiliates or Related Parties to assert, and each Guarantor hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee (i) for any damages arising from the use by others of information or other materials obtained through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems (including the Internet), or (ii) on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.
SECTION 5.04. . All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in
Survival of Agreement
 
the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Agents, the Arranger, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such Person or on its behalf and notwithstanding that any Agent, the Arranger, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any Loan Document is executed and delivered or any credit is extended under the Credit Agreement, and, subject to Section 9.05 of the Credit Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under the Credit Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any LC Exposure is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.04, 2.07 and 5.03 shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
SECTION 5.05. . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic imaging shall be effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart of this Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective as to any Guarantor when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such Guarantor shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the Administrative Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such Guarantor and the Administrative Agent and their respective permitted successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of such Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and the other Guaranteed Parties and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Guarantor shall have the right to assign or transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein (and any attempted assignment or transfer by any Loan Party shall be null and void), except as expressly provided in this Agreement and the Credit Agreement. This Agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each Guarantor and may be amended, modified, supplemented, waived or released with respect to any Guarantor without the approval of any other Guarantor and without affecting the obligations of any other Guarantor hereunder.

The rights of each Lender and Issuing Bank, and each Affiliate of any of the foregoing, under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender, Issuing Bank or Affiliate may have.
