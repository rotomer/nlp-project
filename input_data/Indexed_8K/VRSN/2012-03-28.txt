Item 8.01. Other Events.
On March 27, 2012, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN"), in accordance with its internal procedures for public notice and comment, posted renewal terms for the ..com Registry Agreement which have been negotiated between VeriSign, Inc. (the "Company") and ICANN. The renewal terms are posted on ICANN's website. While the renewal terms contain new provisions regarding indemnification and audit rights, these terms have been included to align the .com Registry Agreement with the terms of the other five largest gTLD registry agreements (including the .net agreement) and the other renewal terms are substantially the same as the terms contained in the existing .com Registry Agreement between the Company and ICANN. The .com Registry Agreement is expected to be renewed on or before November 30, 2012. There can be no assurance that the terms of the .com Registry Agreement will be approved substantially in the form as posted or at all, or that the renewal will occur on or before November 30, 2012.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
