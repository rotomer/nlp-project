FORM 8-K
CURRENT REPORT
Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported): November 29, 2012
VERISIGN, INC.
(Exact Name of Registrant as Specified in its Charter)
 
Delaware
(State or Other Jurisdiction of
Incorporation)

(Registrants Telephone Number, Including Area Code)
 
(Former Name or Former Address, if Changed Since Last Report)
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
(a)    On November 29, 2012, VeriSign, Inc. (Verisign or the Company) entered into a Registry Agreement for the
.com
top-level domain (the 2012
.com
Registry Agreement or the Agreement) with Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), pursuant to which the Company will continue to serve as the authoritative registry operator for the
.com
registry. The 2012
.com
Registry Agreement renews the
.com
Registry Agreement entered into by the Company and ICANN in 2006 (the existing agreement) and provides new provisions regarding pricing, indemnification, audit rights, and service levels (SLAs), through November 30, 2018.
The 2012
.com
Registry Agreement provides that the Company will continue as the exclusive registry of domain names within the
.com
generic top-level domain through November 30, 2018. The 2012
.com
Registry Agreement provides that it shall be renewed for later terms unless it has been finally determined by an arbitrator or court that the Company has failed to cure a fundamental and material breach of certain provisions of the 2012
.com
Registry Agreement and, following the decision of such arbitrator or court, the Company fails to comply with such decision.
The 2012
.com
Registry Agreement revised the pricing provisions for
.com
domain name registrations contained in the existing agreement to provide that the price of a
.com
domain name shall not exceed $7.85 for the term of the Agreement except that the Company will continue to have the right to increase the price of a
.com
domain name during the term of the 2012 .
com
Registry Agreement due to the imposition of any new Consensus Policy or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the Security or Stability (each as defined in the 2012 .
com
Registry Agreement) of the Domain Name System (DNS) not to exceed 7% above the price in the prior year.
The 2012
.com
Registry Agreement also revised the service levels in the existing agreement to match the more stringent SLAs currently offered with respect to the .
net
registry.
The 2012
.com
Registry Agreement added to the existing agreement an obligation by Verisign to indemnify ICANN for certain third party claims, primarily those arising out of the operation of the
.com
registry.
As compared to the existing agreement, the 2012
.com
Registry Agreement expands ICANN's rights to audit Verisign's compliance with Verisign's representations, warranties and covenants contained in Articles II and III of the 2012
.com
Registry Agreement. Also pursuant to the 2012
.com
Registry Agreement, the Company and ICANN have agreed to regularly review and engage in good faith negotiations about the implementation of any such new technical standards and consensus policies.
The 2012
.com
Registry Agreement revised the fees the Company is required to pay ICANN. The Company is required to pay for each initial or renewal registration that occurs during a calendar quarter a fee equal to the number of years in the term of such registration or renewal, multiplied by $0.25. The Company may also be required to collect variable registry fees on ICANN's behalf in fiscal quarters in which ICANN does not collect a variable accreditation fee from all registrars.
As in the existing agreement, the 2012
.com
Registry Agreement provides that the Company may not acquire, directly or indirectly, a greater than fifteen percent ownership interest in any ICANN-accredited registrar. The Company is also required to comply with and implement temporary specifications or policies and consensus policies, as well as other provisions in the 2012
.com
Registry Agreement relating to handling of data and other registry operations. The 2012
.com
Registry Agreement also continues restrictions on ICANN's ability to adopt temporary specifications or policies and consensus policies that can impact the operation of the
.com
registry and existing processes for the introduction by Verisign of new registry services.
(b)    On November 29, 2012, Verisign and the Department of Commerce (the DOC) entered into Amendment Number Thirty-Two (32) (Amendment 32) to the Cooperative Agreement between Verisign and the DOC (the Cooperative Agreement). Except as modified by Amendment 32, the terms and conditions of the Cooperative Agreement, including Amendment Thirty (30) to the Cooperative Agreement which was entered into on November 29, 2006 by the Company and the DOC, remain unchanged. Amendment 32 provides that the Maximum Price (as defined in the 2012
.com
Registry Agreement) of a
.com
domain name shall not exceed $7.85 for the term of the 2012
.com
Registry Agreement, except that the Company is entitled to increase the Maximum Price of a
.com
domain name due to the imposition of any new Consensus Policy or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the Security or Stability of the DNS as described in the 2012
.com
Registry Agreement, provided that the Company may not exercise such right unless the DOC provides prior written approval that the exercise of such right will serve the public interest, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. Amendment 32 further provides that the Company shall be entitled at any time during the term of the 2012 .
com
Registry Agreement to seek to remove the pricing restrictions contained in the 2012
.com
Registry Agreement if the Company demonstrates to the DOC that market conditions no longer warrant pricing restrictions in the 2012
.com
Registry Agreement, as determined by the DOC. Amendment 32 also provides that the DOC's approval of the 2012
.com
Registry
Agreement is not intended to confer federal antitrust immunity on the Company with respect to the 2012
.com
Registry Agreement and extends the term of the Cooperative Agreement through November 30, 2018.
 The descriptions of the 2012
.com
Registry Agreement and Amendment 32 contained herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to those agreements, copies of which are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

Covenants of Registry Operator
. Registry Operator covenants and agrees with ICANN as follows:
(a)
    
Preserve Security and Stability
. 
(i)
    ICANN Temporary Specifications or Policies. Registry Operator shall comply with and implement all specifications or policies established by the ICANN Board of Directors on a temporary basis, if adopted by the ICANN Board of Directors by a vote of at least two-thirds of its members, so long as the ICANN Board of Directors reasonably determines that immediate temporary establishment of a specification or policy on the
1
subject is necessary to maintain the Stability or Security (as defined in Section 3.1(d)(iv)(G)) of Registry Services or the DNS (Temporary Specification or Policies). Such proposed specification or policy shall be as narrowly tailored as feasible to achieve those objectives. In establishing any specification or policy under this provision, the ICANN Board of Directors shall state the period of time for which the specification or policy is temporarily adopted and shall immediately implement the Consensus Policy development process set forth in ICANNs Bylaws. ICANN shall also issue an advisory statement containing a detailed explanation of its reasons for adopting the temporary specification or policy and why the Board believes the specification or policy should receive the consensus support of Internet stakeholders. If the period of time for which the specification or policy is adopted exceeds 90 days, the ICANN Board shall reaffirm its temporary adoption every 90 days for a total period not to exceed one year, in order to maintain such policy in effect until such time as it shall become a Consensus Policy as described in Section 3.1(b) below. If during such one year period, the temporary policy or specification does not become a Consensus Policy meeting the standard set forth in Section 3.1(b) below, Registry Operator shall no longer be required to comply with or implement such temporary policy or specification.
(b)
    
Consensus Policies
.
(i)
    At all times during the term of this Agreement and subject to the terms hereof, Registry Operator will fully comply with and implement all Consensus Policies found at http://www.icann.org/en/general/consensus-policies.htm, as of the Effective Date and as may in the future be developed and adopted in accordance with ICANNs Bylaws and as set forth below. 
(ii)
    Consensus Policies are those specifications or policies established (1) pursuant to the procedure set forth in ICANNs Bylaws and due process, and (2) covering those topics listed in Section 3.1(b)(iv) below.  The Consensus Policy development process and procedure set forth in ICANNs Bylaws may be revised from time to time in accordance with ICANNs Bylaws, and any Consensus Policy that is adopted through such a revised process and covering those topics listed in Section 3.1(b)(iv) below shall be considered a Consensus Policy for purposes of this Agreement. 
(iii)
    For all purposes under this Agreement, the policies identified at http://www.icann.org/en/general/consensus-policies.htm shall be treated in the same manner and have the same effect as Consensus Policies.
(iv)
    Consensus Policies and the procedures by which they are developed shall be designed to produce, to the extent possible, a consensus of Internet stakeholders, including the operators of gTLDs.  Consensus Policies shall relate to one or more of the following: (1) issues for which uniform or coordinated resolution is reasonably necessary to facilitate interoperability, Security and/or Stability of the Internet or DNS; (2) functional and performance specifications for the provision of Registry Services (as defined in Section 3.1(d)(iii) below); (3) Security and Stability of the registry database for the TLD; (4) registry policies reasonably necessary to implement Consensus Policies relating to registry operations or registrars; or (5) resolution of disputes regarding the registration of domain names (as opposed to the use of such domain names).  Such categories of issues referred to in the preceding sentence shall include, without limitation:
(A)
    principles for allocation of registered names in the TLD (e.g., first-come, first-served, timely renewal, holding period after expiration);
(B)
    prohibitions on warehousing of or speculation in domain names by registries or registrars;
(C)
    reservation of registered names in the TLD that may not be registered initially or that may not be renewed due to reasons reasonably related to (a) avoidance of confusion among or misleading of users, (b) intellectual property, or (c) the technical management of the DNS or the Internet  (e.g., establishment of reservations of names from registration);
2
(D)
    maintenance of and access to accurate and up-to-date information concerning domain name registrations;
(E)
    procedures to avoid disruptions of domain name registration due to suspension or termination of operations by a registry operator or a registrar, including procedures for allocation of responsibility for serving registered domain names in a TLD affected by such a suspension or termination; and
(F)
    resolution of disputes regarding whether particular parties may register or maintain registration of particular domain names.
(v)
    In addition to the other limitations on Consensus Policies, they shall not:
(A)
    prescribe or limit the price of Registry Services;
(B)
    modify the standards for the consideration of proposed Registry Services, including the definitions of Security and Stability (set forth below) and the standards applied by ICANN;
(C)
    modify the terms or conditions for the renewal or termination of this Agreement;
(D)
    modify ICANNs obligations to Registry Operator under Section 3.2 (a), (b), and (c);

    alter services that have been implemented pursuant to Section 3.1(d) of this Agreement (unless justified by compelling and just cause based on Security and Stability).
(vi)
    Registry Operator shall be afforded a reasonable period of time following notice of the establishment of a Consensus Policy or Temporary Specifications or Policies in which to comply with such policy or specification, taking into account any urgency involved.
In the event of a conflict between Registry Services (as defined in Section 3.1(d)(iii) below), on the one hand, and Consensus Policies developed in accordance with this Section 3.1(b) or any Temporary Specifications or Policies established pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(i) above, on the other hand, the Consensus Polices or Temporary Specifications or Policies shall control, notwithstanding any other provisions contained within this Agreement.
(c)
    
Handling of Registry Data
.
(i)
    
Data Escrow
. Registry Operator shall establish at its expense a data escrow or mirror site policy for the Registry Data compiled by Registry Operator. Registry Data, as used in this Agreement, shall mean the following: (1) data for domains sponsored by all registrars, consisting of domain name, server name for each nameserver, registrar id, updated date, creation date, expiration date, status information, and DNSSEC  delegation signer (DS) data; (2) data for nameservers sponsored by all registrars consisting of server name, each IP address, registrar id, updated date, creation date, expiration date, and status information; (3) data for registrars sponsoring registered domains and nameservers, consisting of registrar id, registrar address, registrar telephone number, registrar e-mail address, whois server, referral URL, updated date and the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of all the registrar's administrative, billing, and technical contacts; and, (4) domain name registrant data collected by the Registry Operator from registrars as part of or following registration of a domain name. The escrow agent or mirror-site manager, and the obligations thereof, shall be mutually agreed upon by ICANN and Registry
3
Operator on commercially reasonable standards that are technically and practically sufficient to allow a successor registry operator to assume management of the TLD. To this end, Registry Operator shall periodically deposit into escrow all Registry Data on a schedule (not more frequently than weekly for a complete set of Registry Data, and daily for incremental updates) and in an electronic format mutually approved from time to time by Registry Operator and ICANN, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld by either party. In addition, Registry Operator will deposit into escrow that data collected from registrars as part of offering Registry Services introduced after the Effective Date of this Agreement. The schedule, content, format, and procedure for escrow deposits shall be as reasonably established by ICANN from time to time, and as set forth in Appendix 1 hereto. Changes to the schedule, content, format, and procedure may be made only with the mutual written consent of ICANN and Registry Operator (which neither party shall unreasonably withhold) or through the establishment of a Consensus Policy as outlined in Section 3.1(b) above. The escrow shall be held under an agreement, substantially in the form of Appendix 2, as the same may be revised from time to time, among ICANN, Registry Operator, and the escrow agent.
(ii)
    
Personal Data
. Registry Operator shall notify registrars sponsoring registrations in the registry for the TLD of the purposes for which Personal Data (as defined below) submitted to Registry Operator by registrars, if any, is collected, the intended recipients (or categories of recipients) of such Personal Data, and the mechanism for access to and correction of such Personal Data. Registry Operator shall take reasonable steps to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration or destruction. Registry Operator shall not use or authorize the use of Personal Data in a way that is incompatible with the notice provided to registrars. Personal Data shall refer to all data about any identified or identifiable natural person.
(iii)
    
Bulk Zone File Access
. Registry Operator shall provide bulk access to the zone files for the registry for the TLD to ICANN on a continuous basis in the manner ICANN may reasonably specify from time to time. Bulk access to the zone files shall be provided to third parties on the terms set forth in the TLD zone file access agreement reasonably established by ICANN, which initially shall be in the form attached as Appendix 3 hereto. Changes to the zone file access agreement may be made upon the mutual written consent of ICANN and Registry Operator (which consent neither party shall unreasonably withhold).
(iv)
    
Monthly Reporting
. Within 20 days following the end of each calendar month, Registry Operator shall prepare and deliver to ICANN a report providing such data and in the format specified in Appendix 4.
(v)
    
Whois Service
. Registry Operator shall provide such whois data as set forth in Appendix 5.
(d)
    
Registry Operations
.
(i)
    
Registration Restrictions
. Registry Operator shall reserve, and not register any TLD strings (i) appearing on the list of reserved TLD strings attached as Appendix 6 hereto or (ii) located at  http://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt for initial (i.e., other than renewal) registration at the second level within the TLD.
(ii)
    Functional and Performance Specifications. Functional and Performance Specifications for operation of the TLD shall be as set forth in Appendix 7 hereto, and shall address without limitation DNS services; operation of the shared registration system; and nameserver operations. Registry Operator shall keep technical and operational records sufficient to evidence compliance with such specifications for at least one year.
(iii)
    
Registry Services
. Registry Services are, for purposes of this Agreement, defined as the following: (a) those services that are both (i) operations of the registry critical to the following tasks:  the receipt of data from registrars concerning registrations of domain names and name servers; provision to registrars of status information relating to the zone servers for the TLD; dissemination of TLD zone files; operation of the registry zone servers; and dissemination of contact and other information concerning domain name server registrations in the TLD as required by this Agreement; and (ii) provided by the Registry Operator for the .com registry as of March 31, 2006 , as the case may be; (b) other products or services that the Registry Operator is required to provide because of the establishment of a Consensus Policy (as defined in Section 3.1(b) above); (c) any other products or services that
4
only a registry operator is capable of providing, by reason of its designation as the registry operator; and (d) material changes to any Registry Service within the scope of (a), (b) or (c) above. Only Registry Services defined in (a) and (b) above are subject to the maximum price provisions of Section 7.3, below.
(iv)
    
Process for Consideration of Proposed Registry Services
. Following written notification by Registry Operator to ICANN that Registry Operator may make a change in a Registry Service within the scope of the preceding paragraph:
(A)
    ICANN shall have 15 calendar days to make a preliminary determination whether a Registry Service requires further consideration by ICANN because it reasonably determines such Registry Service:  (i) could raise significant Security or Stability issues or (ii) could raise significant competition issues.
(B)
    Registry Operator must provide sufficient information at the time of notification to ICANN that it may implement such a proposed Registry Service to enable ICANN to make an informed preliminary determination.  Information provided by Registry Operator and marked CONFIDENTIAL shall be treated as confidential by ICANN.  Registry Operator will not designate CONFIDENTIAL information necessary to describe the purpose of the proposed Registry Service and the effect on users of the DNS.
(C)
    ICANN may seek expert advice during the preliminary determination period (from entities or persons subject to confidentiality agreements) on the competition, Security or Stability implications of the Registry Service in order to make its preliminary determination.  To the extent ICANN determines to disclose confidential information to any such experts, it will provide notice to Registry Operator of the identity of the expert(s) and the information it intends to convey.
(D)
    If ICANN determines during the 15 calendar day preliminary determination period that the proposed Registry Service, does not raise significant Security or Stability (as defined below), or competition issues, Registry Operator shall be free to deploy it upon such a determination.
(E)
    In the event ICANN reasonably determines during the 15 calendar day preliminary determination period that the Registry Service might raise significant competition issues, ICANN shall refer the issue to the appropriate governmental competition authority or authorities with jurisdiction over the matter within five business days of making its determination, or two business days following the expiration of such 15 day period, whichever is earlier, with notice to Registry Operator. Any such referral communication shall be posted on ICANNs website on the date of transmittal. Following such referral, ICANN shall have no further responsibility, and Registry Operator shall have no further obligation to ICANN, with respect to any competition issues relating to the Registry Service. If such a referral occurs, the Registry Operator will not deploy the Registry Service until 45 calendar days following the referral, unless earlier cleared by the referred governmental competition authority.
(F)
    In the event that ICANN reasonably determines during the 15 calendar day preliminary determination period that the proposed Registry Service might raise significant Stability or Security issues (as defined below), ICANN will refer the proposal to a Standing Panel of experts (as defined below) within five business days of making its determination, or two business days following the expiration of such 15 day period, whichever is earlier, and simultaneously invite public comment on the proposal. The Standing Panel shall have 45 calendar days from the referral to prepare a written report regarding the proposed Registry Services effect on Security or Stability (as defined below), which report (along with a summary of any public comments) shall be forwarded to the ICANN Board. The report shall set forward the opinions of the Standing Panel, including, but not limited to, a detailed statement of the analysis, reasons, and information upon which the panel has relied in reaching their conclusions, along with the response to any specific questions that were included in the referral from ICANN staff. Upon ICANNs referral to the Standing Panel, Registry Operator may submit additional information or analyses regarding the likely effect on Security or Stability of the Registry Service.
(G)
    Upon its evaluation of the proposed Registry Service, the Standing Panel will report on the likelihood and materiality of the proposed Registry Services effects on Security or Stability, including
5
whether the proposed Registry Service creates a reasonable risk of a meaningful adverse effect on Security or Stability as defined below:
Security
: For purposes of this Agreement, an effect on security by the proposed Registry Service shall mean (1) the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, insertion or destruction of Registry Data, or (2) the unauthorized access to or disclosure of information or resources on the Internet by systems operating in accordance with all applicable standards.
Stability
: For purposes of this Agreement, an effect on stability shall mean that the proposed Registry Service (1) is not compliant with applicable relevant standards that are authoritative and published by a well-established, recognized and authoritative standards body, such as relevant Standards-Track or Best Current Practice RFCs sponsored by the IETF or (2) creates a condition that adversely affects the throughput, response time, consistency or coherence of responses to Internet servers or end systems, operating in accordance with applicable relevant standards that are authoritative and published by a well-established, recognized and authoritative standards body, such as relevant Standards-Track or Best Current Practice RFCs and relying on Registry Operators delegation information or provisioning services.
(H)
    Following receipt of the Standing Panels report, which will be posted (with appropriate confidentiality redactions made after consultation with Registry Operator) and available for public comment, the ICANN Board will have 30 calendar days to reach a decision. In the event the ICANN Board reasonably determines that the proposed Registry Service creates a reasonable risk of a meaningful adverse effect on Stability or Security, Registry Operator will not offer the proposed Registry Service. An unredacted version of the Standing Panels report shall be provided to Registry Operator upon the posting of the report.  The Registry Operator may respond to the report of the Standing Panel or otherwise submit to the ICANN Board additional information or analyses regarding the likely effect on Security or Stability of the Registry Service.
(I)
    The Standing Panel shall consist of a total of 20 persons expert in the design, management and implementation of the complex systems and standards-protocols utilized in the Internet infrastructure and DNS (the Standing Panel). The members of the Standing Panel will be selected by its Chair. The Chair of the Standing Panel will be a person who is agreeable to both ICANN and the registry constituency of the supporting organization then responsible for generic top level domain registry policies. All members of the Standing Panel and the Chair shall execute an agreement requiring that they shall consider the issues before the panel neutrally and according to the definitions of Security and Stability. For each matter referred to the Standing Panel, the Chair shall select no more than five members from the Standing Panel to evaluate the referred matter, none of which shall have an existing competitive, financial, or legal conflict of interest, and with due regard to the particular technical issues raised by the referral.
(e)
    
Fees and Payments
. Registry Operator shall pay the Registry-Level Fees to ICANN on a quarterly basis in accordance with Section 7.2 hereof.
(f)
    
Traffic Data
. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Registry Operator from making commercial use of, or collecting, traffic data regarding domain names or non-existent domain names for purposes such as, without limitation, the determination of the availability and Security and Stability of the Internet, pinpointing specific points of failure, characterizing attacks and misconfigurations, identifying compromised networks and hosts, and promoting the sale of domain names; provided, however, that such use does not disclose domain name registrant, end user information or other Personal Data as defined in Section 3.1(c)(ii) for any purpose not otherwise authorized by this agreement. In this regard, in the event the TLD registry is a "thick" registry model, the traffic data that may be accessible to and used by Registry Operator shall be limited to the data that would be accessible to a registry operated under a "thin" registry model. The process for the introduction of new Registry Services shall not apply to such traffic data. The process for the introduction of new Registry Services shall not apply to such traffic data.  Nothing contained in this Section 3.1(f) shall be deemed to constitute consent or acquiescence by ICANN to a re-introduction by Registry Operator of the SiteFinder service previously introduced by the Registry Operator on or about September 15, 2003, or the introduction of any other service employing a universal wildcard function, except that this sentence shall not prohibit the provision of nameservice or any other non-registry service for a domain or zone used for other than registration services to unaffiliated third parties by a
6
single entity (including its affiliates) for domain names registered through an ICANN-accredited registrar. To the extent that traffic data subject to this provision is made available, access shall be on terms that are non-discriminatory.
(g)
    
Security and Stability Review
. Twice annually Registry Operator shall engage in discussions with executive staff of ICANN and the Chairman of the Board of ICANN on trends impacting the Security and/or Stability of the Registry, the DNS or the Internet pursuant to the terms of confidentiality agreements executed both by the executive staff of ICANN and the Chairman of the Board.
(h)
    
Centralized Whois
. Registry Operator shall develop and deploy a centralized Whois for the .com TLD if mandated by ICANN insofar as reasonably feasible, particularly in view of Registry Operators dependence on cooperation of third parties.
Section 3.2
    
Covenants of ICANN
. ICANN covenants and agrees with Registry Operator as follows:
(a)
    
Open and Transparent
. Consistent with ICANNs expressed mission and core values, ICANN shall operate in an open and transparent manner.
(b)
    
Equitable Treatment
. ICANN shall not apply standards, policies, procedures or practices arbitrarily, unjustifiably, or inequitably and shall not single out Registry Operator for disparate treatment unless justified by substantial and reasonable cause.
(c)
    
TLD Zone Servers
. In the event and to the extent that ICANN is authorized to set policy with regard to an authoritative root server system, it will ensure that (i) the authoritative root will point to the TLD zone servers designated by Registry Operator for the Registry TLD throughout the Term of this Agreement; and (ii) any changes to the TLD zone server designation submitted to ICANN by Registry Operator will be implemented by ICANN within seven days of submission.
(d)
    
Nameserver Changes
. Registry Operator may request changes in the nameserver delegation for the Registry TLD. Any such request must be made in a format, and otherwise meet technical requirements, specified from time to time by ICANN. ICANN will use commercially reasonable efforts to have such requests implemented in the Authoritative Root-Server System within seven calendar days of the submission.
(e)
    
Root-zone Information Publication
. ICANNs publication of root-zone contact information for the Registry TLD will include Registry Operator and its administrative and technical contacts. Any request to modify the contact information for the Registry Operator must be made in the format specified from time to time by ICANN.
Section 3.3
    
Cooperation
. The parties agree to cooperate with each other and share data as necessary to accomplish the terms of this Agreement.
Section 3.4
    
Contractual and Operational Compliance Audits
.
(a)
    ICANN may from time to time (not to exceed once per calendar quarter) conduct, or engage a third party to conduct, contractual compliance audits to assess compliance by Registry Operator with its representations and warranties contained in Article II of this Agreement and its covenants contained in Article III of this Agreement. Such audits shall be tailored to achieve the purpose of assessing compliance, and ICANN will (a) give reasonable advance notice of any such audit, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the categories of documents, data and other information requested by ICANN, and (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct such audit in such a manner as to not unreasonably disrupt the operations of Registry Operator. As part of such audit and upon request by ICANN, Registry Operator shall timely provide all responsive documents, data and any other information necessary to demonstrate Registry Operators compliance with this Agreement. Upon no less than five (5) business days notice (unless otherwise agreed to by Registry Operator), ICANN may, as part of any contractual
7

Section 4.1
    
Term
. The initial term of this Agreement shall expire on November 30, 2018. The Expiration Date shall be November 30, 2018, as extended by any renewal terms.
Section 4.2
    
Renewal
. This Agreement shall be renewed upon the expiration of the term set forth in Section 4.1 above and each later term, unless the following has occurred : (i) following notice of breach to Registry Operator in accordance with Section 6.1 and failure to cure such breach within the time period prescribed in Section 6.1, an arbitrator or court has determined that Registry Operator has been in fundamental and material breach of Registry Operators obligations set forth in Sections 3.1(a), (b), (d) or (e); Section 5.2 or Section 7.3 and (ii) following the final decision of such arbitrator or court, Registry Operator has failed to comply within ten days with the decision of the arbitrator or court, or within such other time period as may be prescribed by the arbitrator or court. Upon renewal, in the event that the terms of this Agreement are not similar to the terms generally in effect in the Registry Agreements of the 5 largest gTLDs (determined by the number of domain name registrations under management at the time of renewal), renewal shall be upon terms reasonably necessary to render the terms of this Agreement similar to such terms in the Registry Agreements for those other gTLDs.

meeting, they shall further meet in person at a location reasonably designated by ICANN within 7 calendar days after such initial telephone conference or meeting, at which meeting the parties shall attempt to reach a definitive resolution. The time schedule and process set forth in this Section 5.1(a) may be modified with respect to any dispute, but only if both parties agree to a revised time schedule or process in writing in advance.

In any litigation involving ICANN concerning this Agreement, jurisdiction and exclusive venue for such litigation shall be in a court located in Los Angeles County, California, USA; however, the parties shall also have the right to enforce a judgment of such a court in any court of competent jurisdiction. For the purpose of aiding the arbitration and/or preserving the rights of the parties during the pendency of an arbitration, the parties shall have the right to seek a temporary stay or injunctive relief from the arbitration panel or a court, which shall not be a waiver of this agreement to arbitrate.
Section 5.2

(b)
    
Registry Operator Shall Not Act as Own Registrar
. Registry Operator shall not act as a registrar with respect to the TLD. This shall not preclude Registry Operator from registering names within the TLD to itself through a request made to an ICANN-accredited registrar.

Registry Operator shall pay the Registry-Level Transaction Fee by the 20th day following the end of each calendar quarter (i.e., on April 20, July 20, October 20 and January 20 for the calendar quarters ending March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31) of the year to an account designated by ICANN.

The fee will consist of two components; each component will be calculated by ICANN for each registrar:

ARTICLE VIII
MISCELLANEOUS
Section 8.1
    
Indemnification of ICANN
.
(a)
    Registry Operator shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ICANN (including its directors, officers, employees, and agents) from and against any and all third-party claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, arising out of or relating to: (a) ICANN's reliance, in connection with its decision to delegate the TLD to Registry Operator or to enter into this Agreement, on information provided by Registry Operator in its application for the TLD; (b) Registry Operator's establishment or operation of the registry for the TLD; (c) Registry Operator's provision of Registry Services; (d) collection or handling of Personal Data by Registry Operator; (e) any dispute concerning registration of a domain name within the domain of the TLD for the registry; and (f) duties and obligations of Registry Operator in operating the registry for the TLD; provided that Registry Operator shall not be obligated to indemnify, defend, or hold harmless ICANN to the extent the claim, damage, liability, cost, or expense arose due to a breach by ICANN of any obligation contained in this Agreement or any willful misconduct of ICANN. For avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 8.1 shall be deemed to require Registry Operator to reimburse or otherwise indemnify ICANN for the costs associated with the negotiation or execution of this Agreement, or with the monitoring or management of the parties' respective obligations under this Agreement. Further, this section shall not apply to any request for attorney's fees in connection with any litigation or arbitration between or among the parties.
(b)
    For any claims by ICANN for indemnification whereby multiple registry operators (including Registry Operator) have engaged in the actions or omissions that gave rise to the claim, Registry Operator's aggregate liability to indemnify ICANN with respect to such claim shall be limited to a percentage of ICANN's total claim, calculated by dividing the number of total domain names under registration with Registry Operator within the TLD (which names under registration shall be calculated consistently with Section 7.2 hereof for any applicable quarter) by the total number of domain names under registration within all TLDs for which the registry operators thereof that are engaging in the same acts or omissions giving rise to such claim. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that a registry operator is engaged in the same acts or omissions giving rise to the claims above, but such registry operator(s) do not have the same or similar indemnification obligations to ICANN at set forth in 8.1(a) above, the number of domains under management by such registry operator(s) shall nonetheless be included in the calculation in the preceding sentence.
Section 8.2
    
Indemnification Procedures
. If ICANN receives notice of any third-party claim that is indemnified under Section 8.1 above, ICANN shall promptly notify Registry Operator of such claim. Registry Operator shall be entitled, if it so elects, in a notice promptly delivered to ICANN, to immediately take control of the defense and investigation of such claim and to employ and engage attorneys reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party to handle and defend the same, at the indemnifying party's sole cost and expense, provided that in all events ICANN
13
shall be entitled to control at its sole cost and expense the litigation of issues concerning the validity or interpretation of ICANN policies or conduct. ICANN shall cooperate, at its own cost, in all reasonable respects with Registry Operator and its attorneys in the investigation, trial, and defense of such claim and any appeal arising therefrom; provided, however, that the indemnified party may, at its own cost and expense, participate, through its attorneys or otherwise, in such investigation, trial and defense of such claim and any appeal arising therefrom. No settlement of a claim that involves a remedy affecting ICANN other than the payment of money in an amount that is indemnified shall be entered into without the consent of ICANN. If Registry Operator does not assume full control over the defense of a claim subject to such defense in accordance with this Section, Registry Operator may participate in such defense, at its sole cost and expense, and ICANN shall have the right to defend the claim in such manner as it may deem appropriate, at the cost and expense of Registry Operator.
Section 8.3
    
No Offset
. All payments due under this Agreement shall be made in a timely manner throughout the term of this Agreement and notwithstanding the pendency of any dispute (monetary or otherwise) between Registry Operator and ICANN.
Section 8.4
    
Use of ICANN Name and Logo
. ICANN grants to Registry Operator a non-exclusive royalty-free license to state that it is designated by ICANN as the Registry Operator for the Registry TLD and to use a logo specified by ICANN to signify that Registry Operator is an ICANN-designated registry authority. This license may not be assigned or sublicensed by Registry Operator.
Section 8.5
    
Assignment and Subcontracting
. Any assignment of this Agreement shall be effective only upon written agreement by the assignee with the other party to assume the assigning partys obligations under this Agreement. Moreover, neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ICANN may assign this Agreement in conjunction with a reorganization or re-incorporation of ICANN, to another nonprofit corporation organized for the same or substantially the same purposes. Registry Operator must provide notice to ICANN of any subcontracting arrangements, and any agreement to subcontract portions of the operations of the TLD must mandate compliance with all covenants, obligations and agreements by Registry Operator hereunder. Any subcontracting of technical operations shall provide that the subcontracted entity become party to the data escrow agreement mandated by Section 3.1(c)(i) hereof.
Section 8.6
    
Amendments and Waivers
. No amendment, supplement, or modification of this Agreement or any provision hereof shall be binding unless executed in writing by both parties. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be binding unless evidenced by a writing signed by the party waiving compliance with such provision. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement or failure to enforce any of the provisions hereof shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof, nor shall any such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.
Section 8.7
    
No Third-Party Beneficiaries
. This Agreement shall not be construed to create any obligation by either ICANN or Registry Operator to any non-party to this Agreement, including any registrar or registered name holder.

This Escrow Agreement ("Agreement") is made as of this ___ day of _____, _____, by and between VeriSign, Inc. ("Registry Operator"), Iron Mountain Intellectual Property Management, Inc. ("Escrow Agent"), and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN").
Preliminary Statement.
Registry Operator intends to deliver the "Deposit Materials" and any "Additional Deposit" to Escrow Agent as defined and provided for herein. Registry Operator desires Escrow Agent to hold the Deposit Materials and, upon certain events described herein, deliver the Deposit Materials (or a copy thereof) to ICANN in accordance with the terms hereof.
Escrow Agent certifies that it is allowed to receive the Deposit under the UK Data Protection Act as a registered data controller and/or is certified under the European Union Safe Harbour Act.
Now, therefore, in consideration of the foregoing, of the mutual promises hereinafter set forth, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:
1. Delivery by Registry Operator.
Registry Operator shall be solely responsible for delivering to Escrow Agent the Deposit Materials, as defined and described in the Data Escrow Specification," attached as Appendix 1 to the .com Registry Agreement between Registry Operator and ICANN (the Registry Agreement) and incorporated herein by reference (Appendix 1). Registry Operator may elect to deliver the Deposit Materials in accordance with Exhibit C to Appendix 1 or in a manner mutually agreed upon by Escrow Agent and Registry Operator. Upon receipt of the Deposit Materials, Escrow Agent shall immediately process the Deposit Materials in accordance with Exhibit D of Appendix 1 and generate a file listing, which Escrow Agent shall, within ten (10) business days of the end of each calendar month, forward to Registry Operator, via email or United States mail. Within two (2) business days after receiving them, Escrow Agent shall verify that any Deposit Materials are in the proper format and appear to be complete by performing the verification procedures specified in Exhibit D of Appendix 1. Escrow Agent and Registry Operator agree that Escrow Agent will verify the Deposit Materials using a program that may be provided by ICANN (Scripts). Escrow Agent shall deliver, on the last business day of each month, a written certification to ICANN that it has performed the verification procedures described in Exhibit D on all Deposit Materials received during the last month and shall deliver to ICANN a copy of the verification reports generated by those procedures. If Escrow Agent discovers that any Deposit Materials fail the verification procedures, Escrow Agent shall notify ICANN and Registry Operator of such nonconformity within forty-eight (48) hours. Escrow Agent shall then hold the Deposit Materials in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof.
2. Duplication; Periodic Updates
(a) Escrow Agent may duplicate the Deposit Materials by any means in order to comply with the terms and provisions of this Agreement. Alternatively, Escrow Agent, by notice to Registry Operator, may reasonably require Registry Operator to promptly duplicate the Deposit Materials and forward the same to Escrow Agent.
(b) Registry Operator shall deposit with Escrow Agent the "Additional Deposit," as defined and described in the attached Exhibit A of Appendix 1. Within two (2) business days after receiving them, Escrow Agent shall verify that any Additional Deposits are in the proper format and appear to be complete by performing the verification procedures specified in Exhibit D of Appendix 1. Escrow Agent shall deliver, on the last business day of each month, a written certification to ICANN that it has performed those verification procedures on all Additional Deposits received during the last month and shall deliver to ICANN a copy of the verification reports generated by those procedures. If Escrow Agent discovers that any Additional Deposits fail the verification procedures, Escrow Agent shall notify ICANN and Registry Operator of such nonconformity within forty-eight (48) hours.
3. Notification of Deposits.
Simultaneous with the delivery to Escrow Agent of the Deposit Materials or any Additional Deposit, as the case may be, Registry Operator shall deliver to Escrow Agent a written statement, via
email, specifically identifying all items deposited and stating that the Deposit Materials and/or any Additional Deposit have been inspected by Registry Operator and are complete and accurate. Escrow Agent shall, within two (2) business days of receipt of any Deposit Materials or Additional Deposit, send notification to Registry Operator and ICANN, via email, that it has received from Registry Operator such Deposit Materials and/or any such Additional Deposit. In addition, Escrow Agent shall also include a copy of the processing report as confirmation that it has completed processing the deposit.
4. Delivery by Escrow Agent
4.1 Delivery by Escrow Agent to ICANN.
Escrow Agent shall deliver the Deposit Materials and any Additional Deposits received since the last submission of Deposit Material ("Outstanding Additional Deposits"), or a complete copy thereof, to ICANN only in the event that:
(a) Registry Operator notifies Escrow Agent to effect such delivery to ICANN at a specific address, the notification being accompanied by a check payable to Escrow Agent in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00); or
(b) Escrow Agent receives from ICANN:
(i) Written notification that the Registry Agreement between Registry Operator and ICANN dated March 1, 2006 ("Registry Agreement") has been finally, validly and legally terminated under Section 6 of the Registry Agreement and no injunction or similar order has been obtained from an arbitrator or court prohibiting ICANN from securing the data in this escrow (Registry Termination);
(ii) a written statement that ICANN has previously notified Registry Operator of such Registry Termination in writing;
(iii) a written demand that the Deposit Materials and Outstanding Additional Deposits be released and delivered to ICANN;
(iv) a written undertaking from ICANN that the Deposit Materials and Outstanding Additional Deposits being supplied to ICANN will be used only as permitted under the terms of the Registry Agreement;
(v) specific instructions from ICANN for this delivery; and
(vi) a check from Registry Operator, or from ICANN (who will then be reimbursed by Registry Operator), payable to Escrow Agent in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00); or
(c) Release occurs according to Paragraph 8(b) below.
4.2 Delivery at Registry Operator's Request.
If the provisions of 4.1(a) are satisfied, Escrow Agent shall, within five (5) business days after receipt of the notification and check specified in Paragraph 4.1(a), deliver the Deposit Materials and Outstanding Additional Deposits in accordance with the applicable instructions.
4.3 Delivery at ICANN's Request.
If the provisions of Paragraphs 4.1(b) or 4.1(c) are satisfied, Escrow Agent within five (5) business days after receipt of all the documents specified in these paragraphs, shall deliver the following: (i) to Registry Operator, a photostatic copy of all such documents; (ii) to ICANN, as specifically instructed by ICANN, electronic copies of the Deposit Materials and electronic copies of the Outstanding Additional Deposits; provided, however, that if the delivery is commenced by reason of Paragraph 4.1 (c), Registry Operator may make the payment owing to Escrow Agent during the five (5) business day period referenced above, and Escrow Agent shall not thereafter deliver to ICANN the materials specified in subpart (ii), above. Following receipt of the notice to Registry Operator under subpart (i) of the preceding sentence, Registry Operator shall have thirty (30) days from the date on which Registry Operator receives such documents ("Objection Period") to notify Escrow Agent of its objection ("Objection Notice") to the release of the Deposit Materials to ICANN and request that the issue of entitlement to a copy of the Deposit Materials be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the following provisions:
(a) The sending of an Objection Notice shall not delay delivery of Deposit Materials and Outstanding Additional Deposits to ICANN.
(b) If Registry Operator shall send an Objection Notice to Escrow Agent during the Objection Period, the matter shall be submitted to and settled by arbitration by a panel of three (3) arbitrators chosen by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrators shall apply the law of California exclusive of its conflicts of laws rules. At least one (1) arbitrator shall be reasonably familiar with the
Internet industry. The decision of the arbitrators shall be binding and conclusive on all parties involved, and judgment upon their decision may be entered in a court of competent jurisdiction. All costs of the arbitration incurred by Escrow Agent, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, shall be paid by the party which does not prevail in the arbitration; provided, however, if the arbitration is settled prior to a decision by the arbitrators, the parties involved in the arbitration shall each pay an equal percentage of all such costs.
(c) Notwithstanding Paragraph 4.3(b), the parties agree that any arbitration brought pursuant to Paragraph 4.3 shall not re-evaluate, reconsider, or otherwise subject to review any issues, causes of action, or other claims which were decided, in an arbitration or court decision involving the parties hereto concerning the Registry Agreement and/or the Cooperative Agreement, and that any decision regarding such issues or claims in an arbitration brought pursuant to Paragraph 4.3 would be invalid, unenforceable, and not binding. The propriety, validity, legality, or effectiveness of any terminations or actions under the Registry Agreement and/or Cooperative Agreement shall be determined solely through procedures and remedies provided for by those respective agreements, not through any arbitration brought pursuant to Paragraph 4.3. Any arbitration proceeding brought pursuant to Paragraph 4.3 shall be limited to a determination of whether Paragraphs 4.1(b) and (c) have been satisfied.
(d) Registry Operator may, at any time prior to the commencement of arbitration proceedings, notify Escrow Agent that Registry Operator has withdrawn the Objection Notice. Upon receipt of any such notice from Registry Operator, Escrow Agent shall promptly deliver Deposit Materials and Outstanding Additional Deposits to ICANN in accordance with the instructions provided by ICANN.
(e) If the release of materials to ICANN pursuant to Paragraph 4.3 is judged to be proper in any arbitration brought in accordance with Paragraph 4.3, Escrow Agent shall promptly deliver to ICANN, in accordance with the instructions specified in Paragraph 4.1(b)(v) above, any Deposit Materials and Outstanding Additional Deposits that have not previously been delivered. All parties agree that Escrow Agent shall not be required to deliver such Deposit Materials and Outstanding Additional Deposits until all such fees then due to Escrow Agent have been paid.
(f) If the release of the Deposit Materials and Outstanding Additional Deposits to ICANN pursuant to Paragraph 4.3 is judged to have been improper in any arbitration brought in accordance with Paragraph 4.3, ICANN shall promptly return or destroy, at Registry Operator's discretion, those Deposit Materials and Outstanding Additional Deposits that were received by ICANN pursuant to Paragraph 4.3.

Public Whois Specification
Registry Operator will operate a WHOIS service available via port 43 in accordance with RFC 3912, and a web-based Directory Service providing free public query-based access to at least the following elements in the following format.
Registry Operator commits to participating in and supporting the work in the IETF to produce a Domain Name Registration Data Access Protocol [SAC 051]. Registry Operator shall implement the standard no later than 135 days after it is requested by ICANN if: 1) the IETF produces a standard (i.e., it is published, at least, as a Proposed Standard RFC as specified in RFC 2026); and 2) its implementation is commercially reasonable in the context of the overall operation of the registry.
Registry Operator's Whois service is the authoritative Whois service for all second-level Internet domain names registered in the .com top-level domain and for all hosts registered using these names. This service is available to anyone. It is available via port 43 access and via links at the Registry Operator's web site. It is updated daily. Registry Operator offers public IPv6 transport for its Whois.
To use Registry Whois via port 43 enter the applicable parameter on the command line as illustrated below:
By default, Whois performs a very broad search, looking in all record types for matches to your query in these fields: domain name, nameserver name, nameserver IP address, and registrar names. Use keywords to narrow the search (for example, 'domain root'). Specify only part of the search string to perform a "partial" search on domain. Every domain starting with the string will be found. A trailing dot (or dots) after your text or the partial keyword indicates a partial search. For example, entering 'mack.' will find "Mack", "Mackall", "Mackay", and so on.
To use Registry Whois using the web interface:

They may be used by Registry Operator, but upon conclusion of Registry Operator's designation as operator of the registry for the Registry TLD they shall be transferred as specified by ICANN:
These functional specifications for the Registry TLD consist of the following parts:
1. Registry Operator Registrar Protocol;
2. Supported initial and renewal registration periods;
3. Grace period policy;
4. Nameserver functional specifications;
5. Patch, update, and upgrade policy;
6. Performance Specifications;
7. Responsibilities of the Parties;
8. Additional Services; and
9. Implementation of New Standards
1. Registry Operator Registrar Protocol
1.1 Extensible Provisioning Protocol
Registry Operator shall maintain the Extensible Provisioning Protocol ("EPP") in conformance with the Proposed Standard and Informational RFCs 5730, 5731, 5732, 5734, 5910, and 3915 (and in the event Registry Operator accepts thick registration data RFC 5733) published by the Internet Engineering Task Force ("IETF") and/or any successor standards, versions, modifications or additions thereto as Registry Operator deems reasonably necessary. Registry Operator will support EPP in conformance with the aforementioned standards. If Registry Operator requires the use of functionality outside of EPP RFCs, Registry Operator must document EPP extensions using Internet-Draft format following the guidelines described in RFC 3735. Registry Operator is not required to submit documented EPP extensions to the IETF but to consider the recommendations on standardization described in section 2.1 of RFC 3735. Registry Operator will provide and update the relevant documentation of all the EPP objects and Extensions supported to ICANN prior to deployment.
Registry Operator shall be able to accept IPv6 addresses as glue records in its Registry System and publish them in the DNS. Registry Operator shall offer public IPv6 transport for its Shared Registration System (SRS) to any Registrar, no later than six months after receiving the first request in writing from a gTLD accredited Registrar willing to operate the SRS over IPv6.
Registry Operator shall take action to remove orphan glue records (as defined at http://www.icann.org/en/committees/security/sac048.pdf) when provided with evidence in written form that such records are present in connection with malicious conduct.
2. Supported initial and renewal registration periods
2.1. Initial registrations of Registered Names (where available according to functional specifications and other requirements) may be made in the registry for terms of up to ten years.
2.2. Renewal registrations of Registered Names (where available according to functional specifications and other requirements) may be made in the registry for terms not to exceed a total of ten years.
2.3. Upon change of sponsorship of the registration of a Registered Name from one Registrar to another, according to Part A of the ICANN Policy on Transfer of Registrations between Registrars, the term of registration of the Registered Name shall be extended by one year, provided that the maximum term of the registration as of the effective date of sponsorship change shall not exceed ten years.
2.4. The change of sponsorship of registration of Registered Names from one Registrar to another, according to Part B of the ICANN Policy on Transfer of Registrations between Registrars shall not result in the extension of the term of the registrations and Registry Operator may assist in such change of sponsorship.
3. Grace period policy
This section describes Registry Operator's practices for operational "Grace" and "Pending" periods, including relationships among sequential operations that occur within given time frames. A
Grace Period
refers to a specified number of calendar days following a Registry operation in which a domain action may be reversed and a credit may be issued to a Registrar. Relevant registry operations in this context are:
Extension of a registration period is accomplished using the EPP RENEW command or by auto-renewal; registration is accomplished using the EPP CREATE command; deletion/removal is accomplished using the EPP DELETE command; transfer is accomplished using the EPP TRANSFER command or, where ICANN approves a bulk transfer under Part B of the ICANN Policy on Transfer of Registrations between Registrars, using the procedures specified in that Part. Restore is accomplished using the EPP UPDATE command.
There are five grace periods provided by Registry Operator's Shared Registration System:
Add Grace Period, Renew/Extend Grace Period, Auto-Renew Grace Period, Transfer Grace Period, and Redemption Grace Period
.
A
Pending Period
refers to a specified number of calendar days following a Registry operation in which final Registry action is deferred before the operation may be completed. Relevant Registry operations in this context are:
3.1 Grace Periods
3.1.1 Add Grace Period
The
Add Grace Period
is a specified number of calendar days following the initial registration of a domain. The current value of the
Add Grace Period
for all Registrars is five calendar days. If a Delete, Extend (EPP Renew command), or Transfer operation occurs within the five calendar days, the following rules apply:
Delete.
If a domain is deleted within the
Add Grace Period
, the sponsoring Registrar at the time of the deletion is credited for the amount of the registration; provided, however, that Registry Operator shall have the right to charge Registrars a fee as may be set forth in its Registry-Registrar Agreement for disproportionate deletes during the
Add Grace Period
. The domain is deleted from the Registry database and is immediately available for registration by any Registrar. See Section 3.2 for a description of overlapping grace period exceptions.
Extend (EPP Renew command).
If a domain is extended within the
Add Grace Period
, there is no credit for the add. The expiration date of the domain registration is extended by the number of years, up to a total of ten years, as specified by the Registrar's requested Extend operation.
Transfer (other than ICANN-approved bulk transfer).
Transfers under Part A of the ICANN Policy on Transfer of Registrations between Registrars may not occur during the
Add Grace Period
or at any other time within the first 60 days after the initial registration. Enforcement is the responsibility of the Registrar sponsoring the domain name registration and is enforced by the SRS.
Bulk Transfer (with ICANN approval).
Bulk transfers with ICANN approval may be made during the
Add Grace Period
according to the procedures in Part B of the ICANN Policy on Transfer of Registrations between Registrars.
The expiration dates of transferred registrations are not affected. The losing Registrar's account is charged for the initial add.
3.1.2 Renew/Extend Grace Period
The
Renew/Extend Grace Period
is a specified number of calendar days following the renewal/extension of a domain name registration period through an EPP Command Renew. The current value of the
Renew/Extend Grace Period
is five calendar days. If a Delete, Extend, or Transfer occurs within that five calendar days, the following rules apply:
Delete.
If a domain is deleted within the
Renew/Extend Grace Period
, the sponsoring Registrar at the time of the deletion receives a credit of the renew/extend fee. The domain immediately goes into the Redemption Grace Period. See Section 3.2 for a description of overlapping grace period exceptions.
Extend ("EPP Command 'Renew'").
A domain can be extended within the
Renew/Extend Grace Period
for up to a total of ten years. The account of the sponsoring Registrar at the time of the additional extension will be charged for the additional number of years the registration is extended.
Transfer (other than ICANN-approved bulk transfer).
If a domain is transferred within the
Renew/Extend Grace Period
, there is no credit. The expiration date of the domain registration is extended by one year and the years added as a result of the Extend remain on the domain name up to a total of 10 years.
Bulk Transfer (with ICANN approval). Bulk transfers with ICANN approval may be made during the
Renew/Extend Grace Period
according to the procedures in Part B of the ICANN Policy on Transfer of Registrations between Registrars. The expiration dates of transferred registrations are not affected. The losing Registrar's account is charged for the Renew/Extend operation.
3.1.3 Auto-Renew Grace Period
The
Auto-Renew Grace Period
is a specified number of calendar days following an auto-renewal. An auto-renewal occurs if a domain name registration is not renewed by the expiration date; in this circumstance the registration will be automatically renewed by the system the first day after the expiration date. The current value of the
Auto-Renew Grace Period
is 45 calendar days. If a Delete, Extend, or Transfer occurs within the
Auto-Renew Grace Period
, the following rules apply:
Delete.
If a domain is deleted within the
Auto-Renew Grace Period
, the sponsoring Registrar at the time of the deletion receives a credit of the Auto-Renew fee. The domain immediately goes into the Redemption Grace Period. See Section 3.2 for a description of overlapping grace period exceptions.
Extend.
A domain can be extended within the
Auto-Renew Grace Period
for up to a total of ten years. The account of the sponsoring Registrar at the time of the additional extension will be charged for the additional number of years the registration is extended.
Transfer (other than ICANN-approved bulk transfer).
If a domain is transferred within the
Auto-Renew Grace Period
, the losing Registrar is credited with the Auto-Renew charge and the year added by the Auto-Renew operation is cancelled. The expiration date of the domain is extended by one year up to a total maximum of ten and the gaining Registrar is charged for that additional year, even in cases where a full year is not added because of the 10-year registration term maximum limitation.
Bulk Transfer (with ICANN approval).
Bulk transfers with ICANN approval may be made during the
Auto-Renew Grace Period
according to the procedures in Part B of the ICANN Policy on Transfer of Registrations between Registrars. The expiration dates of transferred registrations are not affected. The losing Registrar's account is charged for the Auto-Renew.
3.1.4 Transfer Grace Period
The
Transfer Grace Period
is a specified number of calendar days following the transfer of a domain according to Part A of the ICANN Policy on Transfer of Registrations between Registrars. The current value of the
Transfer Grace Period
is five calendar days. If a Delete, Extend, or Transfer occurs within that five calendar days, the following rules apply:
Delete.
If a domain is deleted within the
Transfer Grace Period
, the sponsoring Registrar at the time of the deletion receives a credit of the transfer fee. The domain immediately goes into the Redemption Grace Period. See Section 3.2 for a description of overlapping grace period exceptions.
Extend.
If a domain registration is extended within the
Transfer Grace Period
, there is no credit for the transfer. The Registrar's account will be charged for the number of years the registration is extended. The expiration date of the domain registration is extended by the number of years, up to a maximum of ten years, as specified by the Registrar's requested Extend operation.
Transfer (other than ICANN-approved bulk transfer).
If a domain is transferred within the
Transfer Grace Period
, there is no credit. The expiration date of the domain registration is extended by one year up to a maximum term of ten years. The ICANN Policy on Transfer of Registrations between Registrars does not allow transfers within the first 60 days after another transfer has occurred; it is the Registrar's responsibility to enforce this restriction.
Bulk Transfer (with ICANN approval).
Bulk transfers with ICANN approval may be made during the
Transfer Grace Period
according to the procedures in Part B of the ICANN Policy on Transfer of Registrations between Registrars. The expiration dates of transferred registrations are not affected. The losing Registrar's account is charged for the Transfer operation that occurred prior to the Bulk Transfer.
3.1.5 Bulk Transfer Grace Period
There is no grace period associated with Bulk Transfer operations. Upon completion of the Bulk Transfer, any associated fee is not refundable.
3.1.6 Redemption Grace Period
A domain name is placed in REDEMPTIONPERIOD status when a Registrar requests the deletion of a domain that is not within the Add Grace Period. A name that is in REDEMPTIONPERIOD status will not be included in the zone file. A Registrar cannot modify or purge a domain in REDEMPTIONPERIOD status. The only action a Registrar can take on a domain in REDEMPTIONPERIOD is to request that it be restored. Any other Registrar requests to modify or otherwise update the domain will be rejected. Unless restored, the domain will be held in REDEMPTIONPERIOD status for a specified number of calendar days. The current length of this Redemption Period is 30 calendar days.
3.2 Overlapping Grace Periods
If an operation is performed that falls into more than one grace period, the actions appropriate for each grace period apply (with some exceptions as noted below).
3.2.1 Overlap Exception
Note:
If several billable operations, including a transfer, are performed on a domain and the domain is deleted within the grace periods of each of those operations, only those operations that were performed after the latest transfer, including the latest transfer, are credited to the current Registrar.
3.3 Pending Periods
3.3.1 Transfer Pending Period
The
Transfer Pending Period
is a specified number of calendar days following a request from a Registrar (Registrar A) to transfer a domain in which the current Registrar of the domain (Registrar B) may explicitly approve or reject the transfer request. The current value of the
Transfer Pending Period
is five calendar days for all Registrars. The transfer will be finalized upon receipt of explicit approval or rejection from the current Registrar (Registrar B). If the
current Registrar (Registrar B) does not explicitly approve or reject the request initiated by Registrar A, the Registry Operator will approve the request automatically after the end of the
Transfer Pending Period
. During the
Transfer Pending Period
:
a. EPP TRANSFER request or EPP RENEW request is denied. b. SYNC is not allowed. c. EPP DELETE request is denied. d. Bulk Transfer operations are allowed. e. EPP UPDATE request is denied.
After a transfer of a domain, the EPP TRANSFER request may be denied for 60 days.
3.3.2 Pending Delete Period
A domain name is placed in PENDING DELETE status if it has not been restored during the Redemption Grace Period. A name that is in PENDING DELETE status will not be included in the zone file. All Registrar requests to modify or otherwise update a domain in PENDING DELETE status will be rejected. A domain name is purged from the registry database a specified number of calendar days after it is placed in PENDING DELETE status. The current length of this Pending Delete Period is five calendar days.
4. Nameserver functional specifications
Nameserver operations for the Registry TLD shall comply with RFCs 1034, 1035, 1982, 2181, 2182, 2671, 3226, 3596, 3597, 4343, and 5966 published by the Internet Engineering Task Force ("IETF") and/or any successor standards, versions, modifications or additions thereto.
Registry Operator shall sign its TLD zone files implementing Domain Name System Security Extensions ("DNSSEC"). Registry Operator shall comply with RFCs 4033, 4034, 4035, 4509 and their successors, and the parties agree that best practices described in RFC 4641 and its successors are recommended but not mandatory. If Registry Operator implements Hashed Authenticated Denial of Existence for DNS Security Extensions, it shall comply with RFC 5155 and its successors. Registry Operator shall accept public-key material from child domain names in a secure manner according to industry best practices. Registry shall also publish in its website the DNSSEC Practice Statements (DPS) describing critical security controls and procedures for key material storage, access and usage for its own keys and secure acceptance of registrants' public-key material. Registry Operator shall publish its DPS following the format described in the "DPS-framework" (currently in draft format, see http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-dps-framework) within 180 days after the "DPS-framework" becomes an RFC.
Registry Operator shall offer public IPv6 transport for, at least, two of the Registry's name servers listed in the root zone with the corresponding IPv6 addresses registered with IANA. Registry Operator should follow "DNS IPv6 Transport Operational Guidelines" as described in BCP 91 and the recommendations and considerations described in RFC 4472.
For domain names which are either not registered, or the registrant has not supplied valid records such as NS records for listing in the DNS zone file, or their status does not allow them to be published in the DNS, the use of DNS wildcard Resource Records as described in RFCs 1034 and 4592 or any other method or technology for synthesizing DNS Resources Records or using redirection within the DNS by the Registry Operator is prohibited. When queried for such domain names the authoritative name servers must return a "Name Error" response (also known as NXDOMAIN), RCODE 3 as described in RFC 1035 and related RFCs. This provision applies for all DNS zone files at all levels in the DNS tree for which the Registry Operator (or an affiliate engaged in providing Registration Services) maintains data, arranges for such maintenance, or derives revenue from such maintenance but this provision shall not apply to the provision of nameservice or any other non-registry service for a domain or zone used for other than registration services to unaffiliated third parties by a single entity (including its affiliates) for domain names registered through an ICANN-Accredited Registrar.
If the Registry Operator offers Internationalized Domain Names ("IDNs"), it shall comply with RFCs 5890, 5891, 5892, 5893 and their successors. Registry Operator shall comply with the ICANN IDN Guidelines at <http://www.icann.org/en/topics/idn/implementation-guidelines.htm>, as they may be amended, modified, or superseded from time to time. Registry Operator shall publish and keep updated its IDN Tables and IDN Registration Rules in the IANA Repository of IDN Practices.
5. Patch, update, and upgrade policy
Registry Operator may issue periodic patches, updates or upgrades to the Software, EPP or APIs ("Licensed Product") licensed under the Registry-Registrar Agreement (the "Agreement") that will enhance functionality or otherwise improve the Shared Registration System under the Agreement. For the purposes of this Section 5 of Appendix 7, the following terms have the associated meanings set forth herein.  
5.1 A "Patch" means minor modifications to the Licensed Product made by Registry Operator during the performance of error correction services. A Patch does not constitute a Version.  
5.2 An "Update" means a new release of the Licensed Product which may contain error corrections, minor enhancements, and, in certain circumstances, major enhancements, and which is indicated by a change in the digit to right of the decimal point in the version number of the Licensed Product.  
5.3 An "Upgrade" means a new release of the Licensed Product which involves the addition of substantial or substantially enhanced functionality and which is indicated by a change in the digit to the left of the decimal point in the version of the Licensed Product.  
5.4 A "Version" means the Licensed Product identified by any single version number.  
Each Update and Upgrade causes a change in version. * Patches do not require corresponding changes to client applications developed, implemented, and maintained by each Registrar. * Updates may require changes to client applications by each Registrar in order to take advantage of the new features and/or capabilities and continue to have access to the Shared Registration System. * Upgrades require changes to client applications by each Registrar in order to take advantage of the new features and/or capabilities and continue to have access to the Shared Registration System.  
Registry Operator, in its sole discretion, will deploy Patches during scheduled and announced Shared Registration System maintenance periods.  
For Updates and Upgrades, Registry Operator will give each Registrar notice prior to deploying the Updates and Upgrades into the production environment. The notice shall be at least ninety (90) days. Such notice will include an initial notice before deploying the Update that requires changes to client applications or the Upgrade into the Operational Test and Evaluation ("OT&E") environment to which all Registrars have access. Registry Operator will maintain the Update or Upgrade in the OT&E environment for at least thirty (30) days, to allow each Registrar the opportunity to modify its client applications and complete testing, before implementing the new code in the production environment.  
This notice period shall not apply in the event Registry Operator's system is subject to the imminent threat of a failure or a material security threat, the discovery of a major security vulnerability, or a Denial of Service (DoS) attack where the Registry Operator's systems are rendered inaccessible by being subject to:
i) excessive levels of data traffic ii) unauthorized traffic iii) data traffic not conforming to the protocols used by the Registry
6. Performance Specifications

") as further defined in Sections 6.2.1 through 6.2.4.
6.2.1
Service Availability
is measured as follows:
Service Availability % = {[(MTM - POMU) - UOM] / (MTM - POMU)}*100 where:
MTM
= Monthly Timeframe Minutes calculated as the number days in that month times 24 hours times 60 minutes. For example, the MTM for January is 31 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes or MTM = 44,640 minutes.
POMU
= Planned Outage Minutes Used equals the number of minutes of a Planned Outage (as defined in Section 6.3 below) or Extended Planned Outage (as defined in Section 6.4 below) for that Monthly Timeframe for each individual System Service. No Monthly Timeframe shall have both a Planned and an Extended Planned Outage.
UOM
= Unplanned Outage Minutes equals the total number of minutes the System Services is unavailable excluding any Planned Outages (as defined in Section 6.3 below) or Extended Planned Outage (as defined in Section 6.4 below) for that Monthly Timeframe.
The Service Availability calculation shall be calculated by the Registry Operator and the results reported for each Monthly Timeframe for SRS, Whois and DNS Name Server availability. For Service Availability Performance Specifications measured by calendar year, Yearly Timeframe Minutes (YTM) shall be substituted for Monthly Timeframe Minutes (MTM) in the calculation above. Yearly Timeframe Minutes calculated as 365 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes = 525,600 minutes. Results will be reported to the Registrar Community via e-mail and to ICANN according to Appendix 4.
6.2.2 Service Availability--SRS = 99.99% per calendar year.
Service Availability as it applies to the SRS refers to the ability of the SRS to respond to ICANN-Accredited Registrars that access the SRS through the EPP protocol. SRS unavailability, except for Planned Outages (as defined in Section 6.3 below) and Extended Planned Outages (as

SRS unavailability as it applies to the SRS shall mean when, as a result of a failure of systems within the Registry's control, an ICANN-Accredited Registrar is unable to establish a session with the SRS gateway; provided, however, that SRS unavailability shall not include an ICANN-Accredited Registrar's inability to establish a session with the SRS gateway that results from it exceeding its designated number of sessions. Establishing a session with the SRS gateway shall be defined as:
a) successfully complete a TCP session start,
b) successfully complete the SSL authentication handshake, and
c) successfully complete the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) login command.
Registry Operator will log SRS unavailability once an ICANN-Accredited Registrar reports an occurrence to Registry Operator's customer service help desk in the manner required by the Registry Operator (i.e., e-mail, fax, telephone). The committed Service Availability for SRS is 99.99% per calendar year. The SRS Service Availability metric is a Credit Level 2.
6.2.3 Service Availability--DNS Name Server = 100% per Monthly Timeframe.

(iii) Extended Planned Outage Timeframe - Whois = no Extended Planned Outages allowed.
The Extended Planned Outage Notification metric is a Credit Level 5.
6.5 Processing Time.
Processing time is a measurement of Service Availability and equals the Round-trip for the System Services ("
Processing Time
"). The Registry Operator will log the Processing Time for all of the protocol transactions (i.e. Check, Add/Create, Modify/Update and Delete). Processing Time will be measured in a Monthly Timeframe and reported on a monthly basis to ICANN in accordance with Appendix 4. Should the total volume of protocol transactions (measured individually) added by all ICANN-Accredited Registrars for a Monthly Timeframe exceed Registry Operator's actual volume of protocol transactions for the previous Monthly Timeframe by more than 20%, then ICANN-Accredited Registrars shall not be eligible for any SLA credit, and Registry Operator shall have no liability to ICANN, if Registry Operator fails to meet a Processing Time Performance Specification set forth in this Section 6.5.
6.5.1 Processing Time--Check Domain = 25 milliseconds for 95%.
(i) The Processing Time for Check Domain is applicable to the SRS as accessed through the defined protocol (EPP) for registry-registrar interaction and measures the Processing Time for an availability check of a specific domain name.

The Processing Time for the DNS Name Server metric is a Credit Level 3.
6.6 Update Frequency.
The Registry Operator makes timely updates to the data on the DNS Name Servers and Whois. ICANN-Accredited Registrars record these updates through the SRS. The SRS then updates the DNS Name Server and the Whois. Registry Operator processes this updates on a near real time basis.
The committed performance specification with regards to Update frequency for both the DNS Name Server and the Whois is 3 minutes for 95% of the transactions during a Monthly Timeframe. That is, 95% of the updates to the DNS Name Servers and Whois during a Monthly Timeframe will be completed within 3 minutes. Update frequency is measured from the time that the Registry Operator confirms the update to the time the update appears in the DNS Name Server and Whois. Update frequency performance will be reported on a monthly basis to ICANN in accordance with Appendix 4.

The Update frequency--Whois is 3 minutes for 95% during a Monthly Timeframe.
The Update frequency metric for Whois is Credit Level 4.
6.7 Cross-Network Name Server Performance Requirements.
DNS Name Server Round-trip and packet loss from the Internet are important elements of the quality of service provided by the Registry Operator. These characteristics, however, are affected by Internet performance and, therefore, cannot be closely controlled by Registry Operator. Accordingly, these requirements are not matters subject to SLA Credits under the Service Level Agreement set forth on Appendix 10 or obligations upon which a breach by Registry Operator of the Registry Agreement may be asserted.
The committed performance specification for cross-network name server performance is a measured Round-trip of under 300 milliseconds and measured packet loss of under 1% averaged over the course of a Monthly Timeframe and no greater than 5% for any five (5) minute period over the course of the Monthly Timeframe. Cross-network name server performance measurements may be conducted by ICANN at the times of its choosing, in the following manner:
6.7.1 The measurements may be conducted by sending strings of DNS request packets from different measuring locations to each of the .com DNS Name Servers and observing the responses from the .com DNS Name Servers. (These strings of requests and responses are referred to as a "
CNNP Test
".) The measuring locations will be distributed around the Internet.
6.7.2 Each string of request packets will consist of UDP or TCP packets requesting nameserver (NS) records for arbitrarily selected .com second-level domains, preselected to ensure that the names exist in the Registry TLD and are resolvable. The packet loss (i.e. the percentage of response packets not received) and the average Round-trip time for response packets received may be noted.
6.7.3 To meet the packet loss and Round-trip requirements for a particular CNNP Test, all three of the following must be true:
6.7.3.1 The Round-trip and packet loss from each measurement location to at least one .com name server must not exceed the required values;
6.7.3.2 The packet loss to each of the .com name servers from at least one of the measurement locations must not exceed the required value; and
6.7.3.3 Any failing CNNP Test result obtained during an identified Core Internet Service Failure shall not be considered.
6.7.4 To ensure a properly diverse testing sample, ICANN will conduct the CNNP Tests at varying times (i.e. at different times of the day, as well as on different days of the week). Registry Operator may only be deemed to have persistently failed to meet the cross-network name server performance requirement only if the .com DNS Name Servers fail the CNNP Tests (see Section 6.7.3 above) with no less than three consecutive failed CNNP Tests.
6.7.5 In the event of persistent failure of the CNNP Tests, ICANN will give Registry Operator written notice of the failures (with backup data) and Registry Operator will have sixty days to cure the failure.
6.7.6 Sixty days prior to the commencement of testing under this provision, ICANN will provide Registry Operator with the opportunity to evaluate the testing system to be used by ICANN. In the event that Registry Operator raisees concerns regarding such system, ICANN will work directly with Registry Operator to attempt to address those concerns.
7. Responsibilities of the Parties.
7.1 Except in the case of DNS Name Server performance measurements, Registry Operator will perform monitoring from internally located systems as a means to verify that the availability and performance measurements in this document are being met.
7.2 The Registry Operator will provide system performance and availability reports monthly to the Registrar Community via e-mail and to ICANN according to Appendix 4.
7.3 The Registry Operator will provide the Whois Service as specified in Appendix 5.
7.4 The Registry Operator will use commercially reasonable efforts to restore the critical systems of the System Services within 24 hours after the termination of a force majeure event and restore full system functionality within 48 hours after the termination of a force majeure event. Outages due to a force majeure will not be considered service unavailability for purposes of this Appendix 7 or the SLA.
7.5 Registry Operator shall not be liable to ICANN or ICANN-Accredited Registrars for any credits or penalties or be deemed to be in breach of any of its obligations under the Registry Agreement if it fails to meet a Performance Specification as a result of its compliance with any Consensus Policy established after the Effective Date to the extent and for so long as the failure to meet a Performance Specification is unavoidable by commercially reasonable efforts due to Registry Operator's compliance with such Consensus Policy.
7.6 Registry Operator shall provide to ICANN and publish on its website its accurate contact details including a valid email and mailing address as well as a primary contact for handling inquiries related to malicious conduct in the TLD, and will provide ICANN with prompt notice of any changes to such contact details.
8. Additional Services
8.1 Bulk Transfer After Partial Portfolio Acquisition (BTAPPA)
Bulk Transfer After Partial Portfolio Acquisition (BTAPPA) is a Registry service available to consenting Registrars in the circumstance where one ICANN-Accredited Registrar purchases, by means of a stock or asset purchase, merger or similar transaction, a portion but not all, of another ICANN-Accredited Registrar's domain name portfolio in the .com top-level domain.
At least fifteen days before completing a BTAPPA, the losing Registrar must provide to all domain name registrants for names involved in the bulk transfer, written notice of the bulk change of sponsorship. The notice must include an explanation of how the Whois record will change after the bulk transfer occurs, and customer support and technical contact information of the gaining Registrar.
If a domain is transferred under the BTAPPA service during any applicable Grace Period as described in Section 3 above, there is no credit. The expiration dates of transferred registrations are not affected.
Domain names in the following statuses at the time of the Transfer Request will not be transferred in a BTAPPA: "pending transfer", "redemption grace period (RGP)", or "pending delete". Domain names that are within the auto-renew grace window are subject to bulk transfer, but Verisign may decline to provide a credit for those names deleted after the bulk transfer, but prior to the expiration of the auto-renew grace window.
Verisign has discretion to reject a BTAPPA request if there is reasonable evidence that a transfer under BTAPPA is being requested in order to avoid fees otherwise due to Verisign or ICANN, or if a Registrar with common ownership or management or both has already requested BTAPPA service within the preceding six-month period.
9. Implementation of New Protocols
Registry Operator and ICANN agree to engage in good faith negotiations at regular intervals (at least once every eighteen months following the Effective Date) regarding possible implementation of new RFCs related to the
matters addressed in Appendices 1 (Escrow Specifications), 5 (Whois) and 7 (Technical and Functional Specifications).

Active ICANN-Accredited Registrar would be credited:
(.com Registry Fee)*(OT)*(NRAvg)
(1,440 minutes)
Additionally, for any month where the total combined Unplanned Outage of SRS and Whois is greater than 30 minutes, Registry Operator will credit active ICANN-Accredited Registrars that meet the requirements of Section 3 below One Thousand Dollars ($1,000).

If the Performance Specifications are not met, the SLA Credit for Credit Level 6 shall be payable directly to active ICANN-Accredited Registrar(s) that meet the requirements of Section 3 below in an amount equal to the Average Daily Volume (ADM) of net .com new adds as averaged over the course of the previous three months times the Planned Duration Overage (PDO) in minutes times the SLA Credit graduated financial penalty set forth in Table Credit Level 6. For purposes of this Appendix 10, PDO is calculated by subtracting the maximum allowable time in hours and minutes for a Planned Outage Duration or Extended Planned Outage Duration, as applicable, from the total outage in hours and minutes.
Table Credit Level 6
3. Registrar Responsibilities.
In order for ICANN-Accredited Registrars to claim SLA Credits outlined in this Appendix 10, the procedures of this Section 3 must be strictly followed.
3.1 The affected ICANN-Accredited Registrar must report each occurrence of alleged failure by Registry Operator to meet a Performance Specification and make a request for SLA Credit to the Registry Operator's customer service help desk in the manner required by the Registry Operator (i.e., e-mail, fax, telephone) in order to be eligible for a SLA Credit. An affected ICANN Accredited Registrar must initiate a request for SLA Credits within three months of the end of the calendar year in which the failure to meet a Performance Specification occurred.
3.2 Each ICANN-Accredited Registrar must inform the Registry Operator any time its estimated volume of transactions (excluding check domain commands) is expected to exceed the ICANN-Accredited Registrar's previous month's volume by more than 25%. In the event that an ICANN-Accredited Registrar fails to inform Registry Operator of a forecasted increase of volume of transactions of 25% or more and the ICANN-Accredited Registrar's volume increases 25% or more over the previous month, and should the total volume of transactions for the Registry Operator for all ICANN-Accredited Registrars for that month exceed the Registry Operator's actual volume of the previous month's transactions by more than 20%, then the ICANN-Accredited Registrar will not be eligible for any SLA Credits outlined in this SLA in that Monthly Timeframe. An ICANN-Accredited Registrar shall provide such forecast at least 30 days prior to the first day of the applicable calendar month. Registry Operator agrees to provide monthly transaction summary reports to ICANN-Accredited Registrars via e-mail.
3.3 The affected ICANN-Accredited Registrar must provide documentation to support its claim for a SLA Credit. An ICANN-Accredited Registrar shall provide documentation in the form of either:
a) ICANN-Accredited Registrar initiated notification(s) to the Registry Operator of a Performance Specification that exceeded SLA limits or failed to meet SLA requirements, including the trouble ticket number issued by the Registry
Operator. The closing ticket(s) should be included as well in order to determine the total downtime (unless the trouble ticket includes this); or
b) Notification from the Registry Operator (with trouble ticket number attached) of a Performance Specification that exceeded SLA limits or failed to meet SLA requirements. The closing ticket(s) should be included as well in order to determine the total downtime (unless the trouble ticket includes this).
3.4 In order to calculate credits, the affected ICANN-Accredited Registrar must include volume figures for the past three (3) calendar months (or, if less, such amount of time that the ICANN-Accredited Registrar has been authorized to register names in the .com registry) and a certification that these numbers accurately reflect the minimum number of registrations that would be covered during the affected period.
3.5 Registry Operator shall perform the required measurements in order to corroborate the total SLA Credits requested by ICANN-Accredited Registrar. Such measurements and associated documentation shall be delivered by e-mail to each of the ICANN-Accredited Registrars requesting a SLA Credit.
3.6 When the above steps have been accurately completed, Registry Operator shall provide notification of the number of SLA Credits that will be entered in the affected ICANN-Accredited Registrar's account that can be used immediately toward .com domain name registrations and other fees owed to Registry Operator by the ICANN-Accredited Registrar.
4. Obligations.
4.1 Except in the case of cross-network name server performance (which is not a subject of this Service Level Agreement), Registry Operator will perform monitoring from at least two external locations and a minimum of one internal location as a means to verify that a) sessions can effectively be established and b) EPP commands can be successfully completed.
4.2 In the event that all ICANN-Accredited Registrars are affected by a SRS unavailability, the Registry Operator is responsible for opening a blanket trouble ticket and immediately notifying all ICANN-Accredited Registrars of the trouble ticket number and details.
4.3 In the event that the System Services are unavailable to an individual ICANN-Accredited Registrar, Registry Operator will use commercially reasonable efforts to re-establish the affected System Services for such ICANN-Accredited Registrar as soon as reasonably practicable. Any System Services unavailability attributable to any individual ICANN-Accredited Registrar that does not represent a System Services outage will not result in SLA Credits or be subject to this SLA.
4.4 ICANN-Accredited Registrar(s) and the Registry Operator agree to use reasonable commercial good faith efforts to establish the cause of any alleged System Services unavailability. If it is mutually determined to be a Registry Operator problem, the System Services unavailability will be subject to this SLA.
4.5 The Registry Operator will use commercially reasonable efforts to restore any System Services within 24 hours after the termination of a force majeure event and restore full system functionality within 48 hours after the termination of a force majeure event. Outages due to a force majeure will not be considered System Services unavailability, impact the Performance Specifications set forth in Appendix 7, or be subject to this SLA.
4.6 The Registry Operator will open incident trouble tickets within a commercially reasonable period of time and will treat all system performance problems in order of decreasing severity and fix them within a commercially reasonable period of time. Incidents flagged by the measurement system will also qualify as ticketed events and will be subject to this SLA.
4.7 The Registry Operator will publish monthly system performance and Service Availability reports.
5. Miscellaneous.
5.1 This SLA is independent of any rights, obligations or duties set forth in the Registry Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of this SLA and the Registry Agreement, the Registry Agreement shall control.
5.2 As an addendum to the Registry-Registrar Agreement ("RRA"), no provision in this SLA is intended to replace any term or condition in the RRA.
5.3 Dispute Resolution will be handled per RRA Section 6.7.
5.4 Any interruption of System Services that occurs, as a direct result of RRA Sections 2.13 (Resolution of Technical Problems), 5.4 (Non-Payment of Fees), or 6.3 (Force Majeure) or any other applicable provision within the RRA or Registry Operator's compliance with any Consensus Policy established after the Effective Date, will not be subject to this SLA, but only to the extent and for so long as such interruption of System Services is unavoidable by commercially reasonable efforts due to Registry Operator's compliance with such provisions within the RRA or any Consensus Policy established after the Effective Date.

AMENDMENT NUMBER THIRTY-TWO (32)
Whereas
the Department finds that approval of the renewal of the .com Registry Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A, on the terms and conditions set forth below, is in the public interest;
Therefore
, Verisign and the Department agree as follows:
1.    Pursuant to Section I.B.2.A. of Amendment 19,
Verisign Relationship with ICANN
, as amended by Section 2 of Amendment 30, the .com Registry Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A is approved.
2.    The Maximum Price charged by VeriSign for registration or renewal of a .com domain name during the term of the .com Registry Agreement approved hereby shall not exceed US $7.85; provided, however, that VeriSign shall be entitled to increases in the Maximum Price in accordance with Section 7.3(d)(ii) of the .com Registry Agreement; provided further that VeriSign shall not exercise such right unless the Department provides prior written approval that the exercise of such right will serve the public interest, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.
3. (a) At any time after the Effective Date of this Amendment 32, Verisign shall be entitled to seek removal of the pricing restrictions set forth in Section 7.3 of the .com Registry Agreement attached hereto if it demonstrates to the Department that market conditions no longer warrant such restrictions. Verisign shall be deemed to have made such a showing upon demonstrating that competition from other top level domains, use of alternative Internet navigation techniques (including search engines, browsers and URL shorteners, among others), reduced demand for domain names, or other factors are sufficient to constrain Verisigns pricing of Registry Services at the current Maximum Price.
(b) Upon an application by Verisign for removal of pricing restrictions pursuant to Section 3(a) of this Amendment 32, the Department shall consult with Verisign in any evaluation of its application. The Department shall issue a written decision explaining its reasons for granting or denying, in whole or in part, such application within 90 days after submission of the application, or within 90 days after receipt of any additional materials requested by the Department to evaluate the application, whichever date is later. If the Department determines that additional time is needed to complete its review, then the parties shall agree to an extension of time for six months or such other reasonable time as the Department and Verisign may mutually agree.
4.    Section 1.B.10 of Amendment 19,
Expiration Date
, is amended as follows:
The Expiration Date of the Cooperative Agreement shall be November 30, 2018, except that the Department of Commerce may in its sole discretion extend the term of the Cooperative Agreement (1) for a period equal to the length of any term of renewal under Section 4.2 or any other extension or continuation of the Registry Agreement (whether or not the Registry Agreement remains in effect through that term); (2) for a period equal to the length of the term of a substitute registry agreement; or (3) for one year to permit the Department to exercise its rights under section II.9 of this amendment, as amended, if the Department does not approve any renewal under Section 4.2, or any other extension or continuation of or substitution for, the Registry Agreement.
5.    The Departments approval of the .com Registry Agreement is not intended to confer federal antitrust immunity on Verisign with respect to the .com Registry Agreement. Upon signature of both parties, Verisign will provide copies of the Registry Agreement to both the Grants Officer and the Federal Programs Officer.
6.    Except as modified by this Amendment, the terms and conditions of this Cooperative Agreement, as previously amended, remain unchanged.

Covenants of Registry Operator
. Registry Operator covenants and agrees with ICANN as follows:
(a)
    
Preserve Security and Stability
. 
(i)
    ICANN Temporary Specifications or Policies. Registry Operator shall comply with and implement all specifications or policies established by the ICANN Board of Directors on a temporary basis, if adopted by the ICANN Board of Directors by a vote of at least two-thirds of its members, so long as the ICANN Board of Directors reasonably determines that immediate temporary establishment of a specification or policy on the subject is necessary to maintain the Stability or Security (as defined in Section 3.1(d)(iv)(G)) of Registry Services or the DNS (Temporary Specification or Policies). Such proposed specification or policy shall be as narrowly
tailored as feasible to achieve those objectives. In establishing any specification or policy under this provision, the ICANN Board of Directors shall state the period of time for which the specification or policy is temporarily adopted and shall immediately implement the Consensus Policy development process set forth in ICANNs Bylaws. ICANN shall also issue an advisory statement containing a detailed explanation of its reasons for adopting the temporary specification or policy and why the Board believes the specification or policy should receive the consensus support of Internet stakeholders. If the period of time for which the specification or policy is adopted exceeds 90 days, the ICANN Board shall reaffirm its temporary adoption every 90 days for a total period not to exceed one year, in order to maintain such policy in effect until such time as it shall become a Consensus Policy as described in Section 3.1(b) below. If during such one year period, the temporary policy or specification does not become a Consensus Policy meeting the standard set forth in Section 3.1(b) below, Registry Operator shall no longer be required to comply with or implement such temporary policy or specification.
(b)
    
Consensus Policies
.
(i)
    At all times during the term of this Agreement and subject to the terms hereof, Registry Operator will fully comply with and implement all Consensus Policies found at http://www.icann.org/en/general/consensus-policies.htm, as of the Effective Date and as may in the future be developed and adopted in accordance with ICANNs Bylaws and as set forth below. 
(ii)
    Consensus Policies are those specifications or policies established (1) pursuant to the procedure set forth in ICANNs Bylaws and due process, and (2) covering those topics listed in Section 3.1(b)(iv) below.  The Consensus Policy development process and procedure set forth in ICANNs Bylaws may be revised from time to time in accordance with ICANNs Bylaws, and any Consensus Policy that is adopted through such a revised process and covering those topics listed in Section 3.1(b)(iv) below shall be considered a Consensus Policy for purposes of this Agreement. 
(iii)
    For all purposes under this Agreement, the policies identified at http://www.icann.org/en/general/consensus-policies.htm shall be treated in the same manner and have the same effect as Consensus Policies.
(iv)
    Consensus Policies and the procedures by which they are developed shall be designed to produce, to the extent possible, a consensus of Internet stakeholders, including the operators of gTLDs.  Consensus Policies shall relate to one or more of the following: (1) issues for which uniform or coordinated resolution is reasonably necessary to facilitate interoperability, Security and/or Stability of the Internet or DNS; (2) functional and performance specifications for the provision of Registry Services (as defined in Section 3.1(d)(iii) below); (3) Security and Stability of the registry database for the TLD; (4) registry policies reasonably necessary to implement Consensus Policies relating to registry operations or registrars; or (5) resolution of disputes regarding the registration of domain names (as opposed to the use of such domain names).  Such categories of issues referred to in the preceding sentence shall include, without limitation:
(A)
    principles for allocation of registered names in the TLD (e.g., first-come, first-served, timely renewal, holding period after expiration);
(B)
    prohibitions on warehousing of or speculation in domain names by registries or registrars;
(C)
    reservation of registered names in the TLD that may not be registered initially or that may not be renewed due to reasons reasonably related to (a) avoidance of confusion among or misleading of users, (b) intellectual property, or (c) the technical management of the DNS or the Internet  (e.g., establishment of reservations of names from registration);
(D)
    maintenance of and access to accurate and up-to-date information concerning domain name registrations;
(E)
    procedures to avoid disruptions of domain name registration due to suspension or termination of operations by a registry operator or a registrar, including procedures for allocation of responsibility for serving registered domain names in a TLD affected by such a suspension or termination; and
(F)
    resolution of disputes regarding whether particular parties may register or maintain registration of particular domain names.
(v)
    In addition to the other limitations on Consensus Policies, they shall not:
(A)
    prescribe or limit the price of Registry Services;
(B)
    modify the standards for the consideration of proposed Registry Services, including the definitions of Security and Stability (set forth below) and the standards applied by ICANN;
(C)
    modify the terms or conditions for the renewal or termination of this Agreement;
(D)
    modify ICANNs obligations to Registry Operator under Section 3.2 (a), (b), and (c);
(E)
    modify the limitations on Consensus Policies or Temporary Specifications or Policies;
(F)
    modify the definition of Registry Services;
(G)
    modify the terms of Sections 7.2 and 7.3, below; and
(H)
    alter services that have been implemented pursuant to Section 3.1(d) of this Agreement (unless justified by compelling and just cause based on Security and Stability).
(vi)
    Registry Operator shall be afforded a reasonable period of time following notice of the establishment of a Consensus Policy or Temporary Specifications or Policies in which to comply with such policy or specification, taking into account any urgency involved.
In the event of a conflict between Registry Services (as defined in Section 3.1(d)(iii) below), on the one hand, and Consensus Policies developed in accordance with this Section 3.1(b) or any Temporary Specifications or Policies established pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(i) above, on the other hand, the Consensus Polices or Temporary Specifications or Policies shall control, notwithstanding any other provisions contained within this Agreement.
(c)
    
Handling of Registry Data
.
(i)
    
Data Escrow
. Registry Operator shall establish at its expense a data escrow or mirror site policy for the Registry Data compiled by Registry Operator. Registry Data, as used in this Agreement, shall mean the following: (1) data for domains sponsored by all registrars, consisting of domain name, server name for each nameserver, registrar id, updated date, creation date, expiration date, status information, and DNSSEC  delegation signer (DS) data; (2) data for nameservers sponsored by all registrars consisting of server name, each IP address, registrar id, updated date, creation date, expiration date, and status information; (3) data for registrars sponsoring registered domains and nameservers, consisting of registrar id, registrar address, registrar telephone number, registrar e-mail address, whois server, referral URL, updated date and the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of all the registrar's administrative, billing, and technical contacts; and, (4) domain name registrant data collected by the Registry Operator from registrars as part of or following registration of a domain name. The escrow agent or mirror-site manager, and the obligations thereof, shall be mutually agreed upon by ICANN and Registry Operator on commercially reasonable standards that are technically and practically sufficient to allow a successor registry operator to assume management of the TLD. To this end, Registry Operator shall periodically deposit into escrow all Registry Data on a schedule (not more frequently than weekly for a complete set of Registry Data, and
daily for incremental updates) and in an electronic format mutually approved from time to time by Registry Operator and ICANN, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld by either party. In addition, Registry Operator will deposit into escrow that data collected from registrars as part of offering Registry Services introduced after the Effective Date of this Agreement. The schedule, content, format, and procedure for escrow deposits shall be as reasonably established by ICANN from time to time, and as set forth in Appendix 1 hereto. Changes to the schedule, content, format, and procedure may be made only with the mutual written consent of ICANN and Registry Operator (which neither party shall unreasonably withhold) or through the establishment of a Consensus Policy as outlined in Section 3.1(b) above. The escrow shall be held under an agreement, substantially in the form of Appendix 2, as the same may be revised from time to time, among ICANN, Registry Operator, and the escrow agent.
(ii)
    
Personal Data
. Registry Operator shall notify registrars sponsoring registrations in the registry for the TLD of the purposes for which Personal Data (as defined below) submitted to Registry Operator by registrars, if any, is collected, the intended recipients (or categories of recipients) of such Personal Data, and the mechanism for access to and correction of such Personal Data. Registry Operator shall take reasonable steps to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration or destruction. Registry Operator shall not use or authorize the use of Personal Data in a way that is incompatible with the notice provided to registrars. Personal Data shall refer to all data about any identified or identifiable natural person.
(iii)
    
Bulk Zone File Access
. Registry Operator shall provide bulk access to the zone files for the registry for the TLD to ICANN on a continuous basis in the manner ICANN may reasonably specify from time to time. Bulk access to the zone files shall be provided to third parties on the terms set forth in the TLD zone file access agreement reasonably established by ICANN, which initially shall be in the form attached as Appendix 3 hereto. Changes to the zone file access agreement may be made upon the mutual written consent of ICANN and Registry Operator (which consent neither party shall unreasonably withhold).
(iv)
    
Monthly Reporting
. Within 20 days following the end of each calendar month, Registry Operator shall prepare and deliver to ICANN a report providing such data and in the format specified in Appendix 4.
(v)
    
Whois Service
. Registry Operator shall provide such whois data as set forth in Appendix 5.
(d)
    
Registry Operations
.
(i)
    
Registration Restrictions
. Registry Operator shall reserve, and not register any TLD strings (i) appearing on the list of reserved TLD strings attached as Appendix 6 hereto or (ii) located at  http://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt for initial (i.e., other than renewal) registration at the second level within the TLD.
(ii)
    Functional and Performance Specifications. Functional and Performance Specifications for operation of the TLD shall be as set forth in Appendix 7 hereto, and shall address without limitation DNS services; operation of the shared registration system; and nameserver operations. Registry Operator shall keep technical and operational records sufficient to evidence compliance with such specifications for at least one year.
(iii)
    
Registry Services
. Registry Services are, for purposes of this Agreement, defined as the following: (a) those services that are both (i) operations of the registry critical to the following tasks:  the receipt of data from registrars concerning registrations of domain names and name servers; provision to registrars of status information relating to the zone servers for the TLD; dissemination of TLD zone files; operation of the registry zone servers; and dissemination of contact and other information concerning domain name server registrations in the TLD as required by this Agreement; and (ii) provided by the Registry Operator for the .com registry as of March 31, 2006 , as the case may be; (b) other products or services that the Registry Operator is required to provide because of the establishment of a Consensus Policy (as defined in Section 3.1(b) above); (c) any other products or services that only a registry operator is capable of providing, by reason of its designation as the registry operator; and (d) material changes to any Registry Service within the scope of (a), (b) or (c) above. Only Registry Services defined in (a) and (b) above are subject to the maximum price provisions of Section 7.3, below.
(iv)
    
Process for Consideration of Proposed Registry Services
. Following written notification by Registry Operator to ICANN that Registry Operator may make a change in a Registry Service within the scope of the preceding paragraph:
(A)
    ICANN shall have 15 calendar days to make a preliminary determination whether a Registry Service requires further consideration by ICANN because it reasonably determines such Registry Service:  (i) could raise significant Security or Stability issues or (ii) could raise significant competition issues.
(B)
    Registry Operator must provide sufficient information at the time of notification to ICANN that it may implement such a proposed Registry Service to enable ICANN to make an informed preliminary determination.  Information provided by Registry Operator and marked CONFIDENTIAL shall be treated as confidential by ICANN.  Registry Operator will not designate CONFIDENTIAL information necessary to describe the purpose of the proposed Registry Service and the effect on users of the DNS.
(C)
    ICANN may seek expert advice during the preliminary determination period (from entities or persons subject to confidentiality agreements) on the competition, Security or Stability implications of the Registry Service in order to make its preliminary determination.  To the extent ICANN determines to disclose confidential information to any such experts, it will provide notice to Registry Operator of the identity of the expert(s) and the information it intends to convey.
(D)
    If ICANN determines during the 15 calendar day preliminary determination period that the proposed Registry Service, does not raise significant Security or Stability (as defined below), or competition issues, Registry Operator shall be free to deploy it upon such a determination.
(E)
    In the event ICANN reasonably determines during the 15 calendar day preliminary determination period that the Registry Service might raise significant competition issues, ICANN shall refer the issue to the appropriate governmental competition authority or authorities with jurisdiction over the matter within five business days of making its determination, or two business days following the expiration of such 15 day period, whichever is earlier, with notice to Registry Operator. Any such referral communication shall be posted on ICANNs website on the date of transmittal. Following such referral, ICANN shall have no further responsibility, and Registry Operator shall have no further obligation to ICANN, with respect to any competition issues relating to the Registry Service. If such a referral occurs, the Registry Operator will not deploy the Registry Service until 45 calendar days following the referral, unless earlier cleared by the referred governmental competition authority.
(F)
    In the event that ICANN reasonably determines during the 15 calendar day preliminary determination period that the proposed Registry Service might raise significant Stability or Security issues (as defined below), ICANN will refer the proposal to a Standing Panel of experts (as defined below) within five business days of making its determination, or two business days following the expiration of such 15 day period, whichever is earlier, and simultaneously invite public comment on the proposal. The Standing Panel shall have 45 calendar days from the referral to prepare a written report regarding the proposed Registry Services effect on Security or Stability (as defined below), which report (along with a summary of any public comments) shall be forwarded to the ICANN Board. The report shall set forward the opinions of the Standing Panel, including, but not limited to, a detailed statement of the analysis, reasons, and information upon which the panel has relied in reaching their conclusions, along with the response to any specific questions that were included in the referral from ICANN staff. Upon ICANNs referral to the Standing Panel, Registry Operator may submit additional information or analyses regarding the likely effect on Security or Stability of the Registry Service.
(G)
    Upon its evaluation of the proposed Registry Service, the Standing Panel will report on the likelihood and materiality of the proposed Registry Services effects on Security or Stability, including whether the proposed Registry Service creates a reasonable risk of a meaningful adverse effect on Security or Stability as defined below:
Security
: For purposes of this Agreement, an effect on security by the proposed Registry Service shall mean (1) the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, insertion or destruction of Registry Data, or (2) the unauthorized access to or disclosure of information or resources on the Internet by systems operating in accordance with all applicable standards.
Stability
: For purposes of this Agreement, an effect on stability shall mean that the proposed Registry Service (1) is not compliant with applicable relevant standards that are authoritative and published by a well-established, recognized and authoritative standards body, such as relevant Standards-Track or Best Current Practice RFCs sponsored by the IETF or (2) creates a condition that adversely affects the throughput, response time, consistency or coherence of responses to Internet servers or end systems, operating in accordance with applicable relevant standards that are authoritative and published by a well-established, recognized and authoritative standards body, such as relevant Standards-Track or Best Current Practice RFCs and relying on Registry Operators delegation information or provisioning services.
(H)
    Following receipt of the Standing Panels report, which will be posted (with appropriate confidentiality redactions made after consultation with Registry Operator) and available for public comment, the ICANN Board will have 30 calendar days to reach a decision. In the event the ICANN Board reasonably determines that the proposed Registry Service creates a reasonable risk of a meaningful adverse effect on Stability or Security, Registry Operator will not offer the proposed Registry Service. An unredacted version of the Standing Panels report shall be provided to Registry Operator upon the posting of the report.  The Registry Operator may respond to the report of the Standing Panel or otherwise submit to the ICANN Board additional information or analyses regarding the likely effect on Security or Stability of the Registry Service.
(I)
    The Standing Panel shall consist of a total of 20 persons expert in the design, management and implementation of the complex systems and standards-protocols utilized in the Internet infrastructure and DNS (the Standing Panel). The members of the Standing Panel will be selected by its Chair. The Chair of the Standing Panel will be a person who is agreeable to both ICANN and the registry constituency of the supporting organization then responsible for generic top level domain registry policies. All members of the Standing Panel and the Chair shall execute an agreement requiring that they shall consider the issues before the panel neutrally and according to the definitions of Security and Stability. For each matter referred to the Standing Panel, the Chair shall select no more than five members from the Standing Panel to evaluate the referred matter, none of which shall have an existing competitive, financial, or legal conflict of interest, and with due regard to the particular technical issues raised by the referral.
(e)
    
Fees and Payments
. Registry Operator shall pay the Registry-Level Fees to ICANN on a quarterly basis in accordance with Section 7.2 hereof.
(f)
    
Traffic Data
. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Registry Operator from making commercial use of, or collecting, traffic data regarding domain names or non-existent domain names for purposes such as, without limitation, the determination of the availability and Security and Stability of the Internet, pinpointing specific points of failure, characterizing attacks and misconfigurations, identifying compromised networks and hosts, and promoting the sale of domain names; provided, however, that such use does not disclose domain name registrant, end user information or other Personal Data as defined in Section 3.1(c)(ii) for any purpose not otherwise authorized by this agreement. In this regard, in the event the TLD registry is a "thick" registry model, the traffic data that may be accessible to and used by Registry Operator shall be limited to the data that would be accessible to a registry operated under a "thin" registry model. The process for the introduction of new Registry Services shall not apply to such traffic data. The process for the introduction of new Registry Services shall not apply to such traffic data.  Nothing contained in this Section 3.1(f) shall be deemed to constitute consent or acquiescence by ICANN to a re-introduction by Registry Operator of the SiteFinder service previously introduced by the Registry Operator on or about September 15, 2003, or the introduction of any other service employing a universal wildcard function, except that this sentence shall not prohibit the provision of nameservice or any other non-registry service for a domain or zone used for other than registration services to unaffiliated third parties by a single entity (including its affiliates) for domain names registered through an ICANN-accredited registrar. To the extent that traffic data subject to this provision is made available, access shall be on terms that are non-discriminatory.

Section 4.2
    
Renewal

(b)
    
Registry Operator Shall Not Act as Own Registrar

The fee will consist of two components; each component will be calculated by ICANN for each registrar:

ARTICLE VIII
MISCELLANEOUS
Section 8.1
    
Indemnification of ICANN
.
(a)
    Registry Operator shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ICANN (including its directors, officers, employees, and agents) from and against any and all third-party claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, arising out of or relating to: (a) ICANN's reliance, in connection with its decision to delegate the TLD to Registry Operator or to enter into this Agreement, on information provided by Registry Operator in its application for the TLD; (b) Registry Operator's establishment or operation of the registry for the TLD; (c) Registry Operator's provision of Registry Services; (d) collection or handling of Personal Data by Registry Operator; (e) any dispute concerning registration of a domain name within the domain of the TLD for the registry; and (f) duties and obligations of Registry Operator in operating the registry for the TLD; provided that Registry Operator shall not be obligated to indemnify, defend, or hold harmless ICANN to the extent the claim, damage, liability, cost, or expense arose due to a breach by ICANN of any obligation contained in this Agreement or any willful misconduct of ICANN. For avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 8.1 shall be deemed to require Registry Operator to reimburse or otherwise indemnify ICANN for the costs associated with the negotiation or execution of this Agreement, or with the monitoring or management of the parties' respective obligations under this Agreement. Further, this section shall not apply to any request for attorney's fees in connection with any litigation or arbitration between or among the parties.
(b)
    For any claims by ICANN for indemnification whereby multiple registry operators (including Registry Operator) have engaged in the actions or omissions that gave rise to the claim, Registry Operator's aggregate liability to indemnify ICANN with respect to such claim shall be limited to a percentage of ICANN's total claim, calculated by dividing the number of total domain names under registration with Registry Operator within the TLD (which names under registration shall be calculated consistently with Section 7.2 hereof for any applicable quarter) by the total number of domain names under registration within all TLDs for which the registry operators thereof that are engaging in the same acts or omissions giving rise to such claim. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that a registry operator is engaged in the same acts or omissions giving rise to the claims above, but such registry operator(s) do not have the same or similar indemnification obligations to ICANN at set forth in 8.1(a) above, the number of domains under management by such registry operator(s) shall nonetheless be included in the calculation in the preceding sentence.
Section 8.2
    
Indemnification Procedures
. If ICANN receives notice of any third-party claim that is indemnified under Section 8.1 above, ICANN shall promptly notify Registry Operator of such claim. Registry Operator shall be entitled, if it so elects, in a notice promptly delivered to ICANN, to immediately take control of the defense and investigation of such claim and to employ and engage attorneys reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party to handle and defend the same, at the indemnifying party's sole cost and expense, provided that in all events ICANN shall be entitled to control at its sole cost and expense the litigation of issues concerning the validity or interpretation of ICANN policies or conduct. ICANN shall cooperate, at its own cost, in all reasonable respects with Registry Operator and its attorneys in the investigation, trial, and defense of such claim and any appeal arising therefrom; provided, however, that the indemnified party may, at its own cost and expense, participate, through its attorneys or otherwise, in such investigation, trial and defense of such claim and any appeal arising therefrom. No settlement of a
claim that involves a remedy affecting ICANN other than the payment of money in an amount that is indemnified shall be entered into without the consent of ICANN. If Registry Operator does not assume full control over the defense of a claim subject to such defense in accordance with this Section, Registry Operator may participate in such defense, at its sole cost and expense, and ICANN shall have the right to defend the claim in such manner as it may deem appropriate, at the cost and expense of Registry Operator.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, ICANN may assign this Agreement in conjunction with a reorganization or re-incorporation of ICANN, to another nonprofit corporation organized for the same or substantially the same purposes.

of Newly Revised .com Registry Agreement
RESTON, VA  Nov. 30, 2012 
VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ: VRSN), the trusted provider of Internet infrastructure services for the networked world, today announced the U.S. Department of Commerce approved the renewal of Verisigns agreement with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to serve as the authoritative registry operator for the .com registry (the 2012 .com Registry Agreement) for the term commencing on Dec. 1, 2012 through Nov. 30, 2018 with certain new terms and conditions. The Commerce Department determined the 2012 .com Registry Agreement is in the public interest under Amendment 30 of the Cooperative Agreement between the Commerce Department and Verisign. Verisign also announced the execution of the 2012 .com Registry Agreement by both ICANN and Verisign.
The Commerce Departments approval of the 2012 .com Registry Agreement contains important new terms and conditions. First, Verisigns current pricing of $7.85 per domain name registration will continue for the six-year term of the Agreement. Second, Verisign no longer has the right to four price increases of up to seven percent over the six-year term. Price increases are limited to circumstances based on the imposition of new Consensus Policy or extraordinary expenses related to security or stability threats, and now require Commerce Department prior approval. Finally, pricing restrictions may be removed entirely if Verisign demonstrates to the Commerce Departments satisfaction that market conditions no longer warrant such restrictions.
This is an important event that provides certainty and sets a clear direction for the Company, said Jim Bidzos, executive chairman, president and chief executive officer for Verisign. This certainty, combined with our strong portfolio of assets, which includes broad DNS expertise, a combined total of more than 200 unique patents and patent applications in the U.S., the worlds most reliable registry, and over $1.4 billion in cash, positions us well to participate in the growing global market for Internet registry and infrastructure services.
 
Verisign continues to operate the .com registry with unsurpassed security and reliability. With continued innovation and investments in its infrastructure, Verisign has been able to meet the performance and scalability demands of .com. The company has and continues to implement critical technical enhancements for .com, such as IPv6 and DNSSEC support, to ensure the integrity and availability of the Internet Domain Name System (DNS).
