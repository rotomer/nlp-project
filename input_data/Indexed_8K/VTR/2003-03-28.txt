He has been President of Harrah's since April 2001. "Gary has been a valuable and important member of our Board, bringing critical strategic planning and business insight to Ventas," Ventas Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Debra A.

The other members of the Ventas Board of Directors and senior management are grateful to Gary for his hard work and support in our successful efforts at repositioning the Company for strategic growth and diversification. We will miss his many contributions." Loveman sits on the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Executive Committee of the Ventas Board.
