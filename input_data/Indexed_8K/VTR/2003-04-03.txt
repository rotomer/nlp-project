Schweinhart Senior Vice President and CFO (502) 357-9000 VENTAS REPORTS FAVORABLE OUTCOME OF FEDERAL TAX AUDIT; Company Expects to Report Additional $20 Million in Operating Results for the First Quarter 2003 Louisville, KY (April 3, 2003) - Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") announced today that the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has completed its review of the Company's federal income tax returns for its 1997 and 1998 tax years. The Joint Committee on Taxation affirmed the IRS Revenue Agent's report concluding that the Company (1) does not owe any additional taxes for those periods, (2) is entitled to receive an additional refund of $1.2 million for those periods, and (3) is entitled to retain the approximately $26 million federal tax refund (the "Federal Refund") it received in 1999. The IRS Revenue Agent's findings were previously disclosed by the Company in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 and other periodic public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result of these findings, the Company and its principal tenant, Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (NASDAQ:KIND) ("Kindred"), have agreed to disburse approximately $13 million to each company immediately from a previously established Tax Refund Escrow. That Tax Refund Escrow held the Federal Refund and certain other tax refunds related to periods prior to the Company's 1998 spin-off of Kindred. The Company expects to use its portion of the funds to pay down debt. "The completion of our federal audit for 1997 and 1998 represents an excellent outcome for Ventas and its shareholders," Ventas Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Debra A. Cafaro said. "It enhances the certainty and predictability of the Company's future and provides additional funding for execution of the Company's strategic diversification plan. Ventas and Kindred worked cooperatively during the past 3 years to optimize the outcome of the federal tax audit for the benefit of both companies. We will continue to work with Kindred to maximize future distributions from the Tax Refund Escrow." The Company expects to report an increase of approximately $20 million to its operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003, representing the Company's share of the funds disbursed from the Tax Refund Escrow and the reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability. This contingent liability was previously recorded to take into account the uncertainties surrounding the outcome of the IRS audit for the 1997 and 1998 period and was disclosed in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. - MORE -
Ventas Reports Favorable Outcome of Federal Tax Audit Page 2 April 3, 2003 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Following the current disbursement from the Tax Refund Escrow, the Escrow will contain approximately $1 million. The additional $1.2 million federal tax refund is expected to be deposited in the Tax Refund Escrow when received. Under the terms of the Tax Escrow Agreement, when no further claims may be made for tax periods ending in or before 1998, all funds remaining in the Tax Refund Escrow will be distributed equally to the Company and Kindred. In addition, the companies may jointly agree to disburse funds from the Tax Refund Escrow in equal amounts prior to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. The companies anticipate that any additional disbursements from the Tax Refund Escrow will be made as circumstances warrant over the next twelve months. At December 31, 2002, approximately $14.4 million of the Company's portion of the Tax Refund Escrow balance was reported as restricted cash and other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Ventas, Inc. is a healthcare real estate investment trust that owns 44 hospitals, 220 nursing facilities and nine other healthcare and senior housing facilities in 37 states. The Company also has investments in 25 additional healthcare and senior housing facilities. More information about Ventas can be found on its website at www.ventasreit.com.
