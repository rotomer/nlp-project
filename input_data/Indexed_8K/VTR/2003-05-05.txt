Schweinhart Senior Vice President and CFO (502) 357-9000 VENTAS REPORTS FIRST QUARTER FFO OF $0.35 PER SHARE ---------------------- 2003 FFO INCREASES 9 PERCENT OVER 2002 FIRST QUARTER LOUISVILLE, Ky (April 29, 2003) - Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") said today that normalized Funds From Operations ("FFO") for the first quarter 2003 was $27.9 million or $0.35 per diluted share compared with $22.1 million or $0.32 per diluted share for the comparable 2002 period. Net income for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003 was $37.3 million or $0.47 per diluted share. Net income includes a benefit of $20.2 million ($0.26 per diluted share) resulting from the reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability relating to uncertainties surrounding matters pertaining to an IRS audit of the Company's 1997-1998 tax periods that was completed on April 1, 2003. For the first quarter ended March 31, 2002, net income was $12.7 million or $0.18 per diluted share. Normalized FFO for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003 excludes the $20.2 million impact of the reversal of the contingent liability. "Ventas continues to produce reliable growth, delivering a nine percent increase in FFO during the first quarter," Ventas Chairman, President and CEO Debra A. Cafaro said. "Additionally, we continue to work with our primary tenant, Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (Nasdaq:KIND), to help Kindred achieve an orderly exit from the Florida skilled nursing home market on terms that are consistent with our Master Leases and beneficial to both companies." FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS AND OTHER RECENT DEVELOPMENTS o The Company and Kindred distributed approximately $13 million to each company from a previously established Tax Refund Escrow which was a result of the successful completion of the IRS audit regarding the Company's 1997 and 1998 tax periods. The audit concluded that the Company (1) does not owe any additional taxes for those periods, (2) is entitled to retain the approximately $26 million federal tax refund it received in 1999 for those periods, and (3) is entitled to receive an additional refund of $1.2 million for those periods. In addition, as a result of the completion of the audit, the Company will retain substantially all of its favorable tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards. o Ventas increased its first quarter dividend to $0.2675 per share, a 13% increase over prior year quarterly dividend of $0.2375 per share. o Kindred's EBITDAR to rent coverage at the 253 skilled nursing facilities and hospitals it leases from the Company was 1.7x for the year ended December 31, 2002. - MORE -
Ventas Reports First Quarter FFO of $0.35 Per Share Page 2 April 29, 2003 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- o Rating agencies Moody's and S & P recently reconfirmed the Company's unsecured debt rating at Ba3/BB-. Moody's improved the outlook for the Company to "stable." FIRST QUARTER 2003 RESULTS Revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, was $50.4 million, of which $47.1 million (or 93.5%) resulted from leases with Kindred. Expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 totaled $13.1 million and were reduced by the $20.2 million of reversal of a contingent liability, and included $10.8 million of depreciation expense, $17.1 million of interest expense on debt financing, and $1.2 million of interest expense on the Company's settlement with the Department of Justice. General, administrative and professional expenses for the first quarter totaled $3.9 million. FFO GUIDANCE Ventas said it reaffirmed its 2003 normalized FFO guidance of $1.43 to $1.45 per diluted share. The guidance excludes gains and losses, the non-cash effect of swap ineffectiveness under SFAS 133 and the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other capital transactions. The Company may from time to time update its publicly announced FFO guidance, but it is not obligated to so. The Company's FFO guidance is based on a number of assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If any of these assumptions vary, the Company's results may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.
