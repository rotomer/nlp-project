Many of such factors are beyond the control of the Company and its management.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
[VENTAS LOGO]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") said today that normalized Funds From Operations ("FFO") for the second quarter 2003 rose 18 percent to $31.2 million, or $0.39 per diluted share from $23.0 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the comparable 2002 period.
LOUISVILLE, Ky (July 23, 2003)
 
The increase in FFO resulted from increased rents from Ventas's annual lease escalations, income from its 2002 investments, lower debt balances that reduced interest expense, and its June 30, 2003 sale of 16 skilled nursing facilities in Florida and Texas to the Company's largest tenant, Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (NASDAQ: KIND)("Kindred").
 
"Ventas's second quarter was excellent. Our 18 percent increase in FFO reflects the Company's strong internal growth from its lease escalators, the results of its consistent debt pay down efforts and the impact of 2002 acquisitions," Chairman, President and CEO Debra A. Cafaro said. "In addition, the successful sale of 16 skilled nursing assets to Kindred represented a major positive for both companies. We are entering the second half of the year with our focus clearly set on implementing our diversification strategy and maintaining reliable and growing cash flow."
 
Normalized FFO for the six months ended June 30, 2003 was $59.1 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, a 16 percent increase from the same period in the prior year of $45.0 million, or $0.64 per diluted share.
 
Normalized FFO for all periods excludes (a) gains on sales of Kindred common stock, (b) a $20.2 million reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability, which was recorded as income in the first quarter of 2003, (c) losses from extinguishment of debt and (d) a one-time swap breakage incurred in connection with the Company's refinancing in April 2002.
 
After discontinued operations of $0.5 million related to the sale of the 16 skilled nursing facilities, Ventas reported second quarter net income of $16.1 million, or $0.20 per diluted share. After discontinued operations of $23.4 million, or $0.34 per share, net income for the second quarter ended June 30, 2002 was $26.5 million, or $0.38 per diluted share. A breakdown of discontinued operations is included in a schedule attached to this Press Release.

After discontinued operations of $1.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, net income for the six months ended June 30, 2003 was $53.4 million, or $0.67 per diluted share. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2002 was $39.2 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, after discontinued operations of $25.2 million, or $0.36 per diluted share.
 
SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS AND OTHER RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 
 
SECOND QUARTER 2003 RESULTS
 
Revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 was $50.2 million, of which $46.0 million (or 91.6 percent) resulted from leases with Kindred. Expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 totaled $34.5 million, and included $10.2 million of depreciation expense, $16.1 million of interest expense on debt financing and $3.8 million of interest expense on the United States Settlement, which was paid in full without prepayment penalty or premium. General, administrative and professional expenses for the second quarter totaled $3.8 million.

VENTAS TO COMPLY WITH SFAS 145 AND 144 REGARDING THREE PRIOR YEARS' FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
 
Ventas said that, as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), it will re-issue three prior years' financial statements (2000-2002) in an updated format in accordance with the adoption of SFAS 145 to reclassify the loss on extinguishment of debt as continuing operations. SFAS 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB 13, and Technical Corrections" was adopted by the Company in 2003, as required by GAAP.
 
This reclassification does not change the Company's net income or normalized FFO for any period and only affects the presentation of results for the prior periods by conforming the presentation of those prior financial statements to the format adopted in 2003. As required, the loss on the extinguishment of debt will be reflected as a separate line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and will be included in continuing operations rather than being shown as an extraordinary loss. The Company incurred charges for the extinguishment of debt in connection with the refinancing of the entire outstanding principal balance of its indebtedness during Kindred's bankruptcy proceedings in 2000 and again in 2001 and 2002 to reposition itself following Kindred's successful restructuring. The Company has excluded extinguishment of debt charges from normalized FFO.
 
Under SEC requirements for transitional disclosure, the reclassification of extraordinary items to continuing operations required by SFAS No. 145 is required for previously issued annual financial statements for each of the three years shown in the Company's last annual report on Form 10-K if those financials are incorporated by reference in subsequent filings with the SEC made under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, even though those financial statements relate to periods prior to adoption of SFAS No. 145.
 
In addition, Ventas will include in the re-issued financial statements the reclassification of the results of 15 Florida facilities and 1 Texas facility sold to Kindred on June 30, 2003 as discontinued operations. This reclassification does not change the Company's net income or normalized FFO and only affects the presentation of results for the prior periods by conforming the presentation of those prior financial statements to the format adopted in 2002. In accordance with SFAS No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" ("SFAS No. 144"), the results of operations and gain/(loss) on real estate properties sold or held for sale subsequent to December 31, 2001 are reclassified into a single line in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
 
The financial statements attached to this Press Release reflect the reclassification for all periods presented.
 
FFO GUIDANCE
 
Ventas said it reaffirmed its 2003 normalized FFO guidance of $1.50 to $1.52 per diluted share and its 2004 normalized FFO guidance of $1.55 to $1.57.

July 23, 2003
 
The Company's FFO guidance (and related GAAP earnings projections) for 2003 and 2004 exclude gains and losses on the sales of assets, the non-cash effect of swap ineffectiveness under SFAS 133 and the impact of acquisitions, additional divestitures and other capital transactions. Reconciliation of the FFO guidance to the Company's projected GAAP earnings is provided on a schedule at the conclusion of this press release. The Company may from time to time update its publicly announced FFO guidance, but it is not obligated to do so.
 
The Company's FFO guidance is based on a number of assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.

Many of such factors are beyond the control of the Company and its management.

Projected FFO per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004:
 
 
Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT and uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis.
 
FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP")), as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this Press Release.

Portfolio of Properties
 
The following information provides an overview of the Company's portfolio of healthcare properties as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2003, excluding discontinued operations ($'s in thousands):
 
 
Kindred Coverage Ratios
 
The following is based on data provided by Kindred to the Company or obtained from Kindred's public filings. This information reflects Kindred's EBITDAR coverage by Master Lease after management fees and excluding the 16 skilled nursing facilities sold in June 2003:
 
 
1
Trailing Twelve Months EBITDAR ended March 31, 2003 (the latest available data provided by Kindred) to the sum of (a) the Company's Trailing Twelve Months cash rental revenue, plus (b) the $8.6 million in annual rental revenue added by the June 30, 2003 Master Lease amendments.
 
2
Coverage reflects the ratio of EBITDAR to rent. EBITDAR is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent but after deducting management fees. EBITDAR is adjusted to normalize Kindred professional liability expense. EBITDAR is adjusted for the $20.2 million re-allocation of third quarter 2002 to first quarter 2003 professional liability expense to the appropriate prior period, as derived from Kindred's public announcements and detailed property-level information.
 
3
These computations reflect the fourth quarter 2002 and first quarter 2003 impact of the reduction in Medicare reimbursement to skilled nursing facilities, which took effect October 1, 2002. Application of that reduction to the second and third quarter 2002 would result in a pro forma reduction of property level EBITDAR: rent coverage to approximately 1.6(x).
