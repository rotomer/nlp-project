Many of such factors are beyond the control of the Company and its management.

Exhibit 99.1
 
[VENTAS LOGO]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") said today that normalized Funds From Operations ("FFO") for the 2003 third quarter rose 23 percent to $32.2 million, compared with $26.3 million in the comparable 2002 period. Normalized FFO per diluted share increased 8 percent to $0.40, from $0.37 per diluted share for the comparable 2002 period. In the third quarter ended September 30, 2003, the Company had 80.3 million diluted shares outstanding, compared to 70.0 million diluted shares outstanding in the third quarter ended September 30, 2002.
LOUISVILLE, Ky (October 27, 2003)
 
The growth in FFO resulted from increased rents from Ventas's annual lease escalations, income from the Company's 2002 investments in the Trans Healthcare, Inc. (THI) properties and decreased interest expense due to lower interest rates on reduced indebtedness.
 
"Our third quarter performance reflects the benefit of our Master Leases, which continue to give Ventas reliable industry-leading internal FFO growth. In addition, our cash flow remains strong," Ventas Chairman, President and CEO Debra A. Cafaro said. "Increasing our FFO guidance to $1.52-$1.54 per share for 2003 evidences the progress we have made on reducing our debt balances and engaging in positive transactions with our principal tenant, Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (NASDAQ: KIND), whose credit quality and performance continue to improve. We expect our 2004 FFO to show additional growth when we put our strong balance sheet fully to work on new, diversifying investments."
 
NINE MONTH FFO RESULTS
 
Normalized FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 was $91.3 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, a 12 percent increase from the same period in the prior year of $71.3 million, or $1.02 per diluted share.

After discontinued operations of $1.2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, Ventas reported third quarter 2003 net income of $32.2 million, or $0.40 per diluted share.

THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS AND OTHER RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

THIRD QUARTER 2003 RESULTS
 
Revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 was $59.8 million, of which $48.6 million (or 81.3 percent) resulted from leases with Kindred. Expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 totaled $28.8 million, and included $10.2 million of depreciation expense and $14.7 million of interest expense on debt financing. General, administrative and professional expenses for the third quarter totaled $3.6 million.
 
NINE MONTH 2003 RESULTS
 
Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 was $158.2 million, of which $139.6 million (or 88.2 percent) resulted from leases with Kindred. Expenses totaled $75.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, were reduced by the $20.2 million reversal of a contingent liability and included $30.7 million of depreciation expense, $47.1 million of interest expense and $4.9 million of interest expense on the United States Settlement, which was paid in full in June 2003 without prepayment penalty or premium. General and administrative and professional expenses for the nine months ended totaled $11.2 million.
 
2003 AND 2004 NORMALIZED FFO GUIDANCE RAISED
 
Ventas expects its 2003 normalized FFO to increase to between $1.52 and $1.54 per diluted share, up from the previous guidance of $1.50 to $1.52 per diluted share. The increase is due to the Company's continued debt reduction through cash realized from non-income producing assets and lower than anticipated general, administrative and professional fees. If achieved, these results would represent a 13 percent per share growth in normalized FFO in 2003.
 
Ventas expects to achieve 2004 normalized FFO of between $1.58 and $1.62 per share, an increase from its previous guidance of $1.55 to $1.57 per share.
 
The Company's FFO guidance (and related GAAP earnings projections) for 2003 and 2004 excludes gains and losses on the sales of assets, and the impact of acquisitions, additional divestitures and capital transactions.
 
At September 30, 2003, the Company's floating rate debt balance was $313 million and the aggregate notional amount of the Company's interest rate LIBOR swap (the "Swap") was $450 million. Therefore, the notional amount of the swap was in excess of the Company's outstanding variable rate debt balances. The Company currently expects that in the future its variable rate debt balances will increase to equal or exceed the notional amount of its interest rate swap. As a result, interest expense is likely to increase. If the Company does not increase its variable rate debt balances to equal or exceed the notional amount of the Swap, then under certain circumstances the Company may record a noncash expense for swap ineffectiveness equal to the portion of the unrealized loss on the Swap allocable to the excess notional amount of the Swap or pay to reduce the notional amount of the Swap to more closely match its variable rate debt balances. The Company's FFO guidance for 2003 and 2004 excludes the impact of any such expense or cost.

Reconciliation of the FFO guidance to the Company's projected GAAP earnings is provided on a schedule attached to this Press Release. The Company may from time to time update its publicly announced FFO guidance, but it is not obligated to do so.
 
The Company's FFO guidance is based on a number of assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.

Projected FFO per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004:
 
 
Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT and uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis.
 
FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP")), as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this Press Release.

Net Debt to EBITDA
 
Earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") and Normalized EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2002 (dollars in thousands):
 
 
1
EBITDA has been annualized for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. The lease termination fee of $4.1 million has not been annualized.
 
The Company considers EBITDA a profitability measure which indicates the Company's ability to service debt. Normalized EBITDA excludes income and expense items that are nonrecurring in the Company's core business. The Company considers the Net Debt to EBITDA ratio a useful measure to evaluate the Company's ability to pay its indebtedness. EBITDA presented herein is not necessarily comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is EBITDA necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this Press Release.

Portfolio of Properties
 
The following information provides an overview of the Company's portfolio of healthcare properties as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, excluding discontinued operations ($'s in thousands):
 
 
Kindred Coverage Ratios
 
The following is based on data provided by Kindred to the Company or obtained from Kindred's public filings. This information reflects Kindred's EBITDAR coverage by Master Lease after management fees and excluding the 16 skilled nursing facilities sold in June 2003:
 
 
1
Trailing Twelve Months EBITDAR ended June 30, 2003 (the latest available data provided by Kindred) to the sum of (a) the Company's Trailing Twelve Months cash rental revenue, plus (b) the $8.6 million in annual rental revenue added by the June 30, 2003 Master Lease amendments.
 
2
Coverage reflects the ratio of EBITDAR to rent. EBITDAR is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent but after deducting management fees. EBITDAR is adjusted by $18.6 million in order to normalize certain of Kindred's professional liability insurance expenses.
 
3
These computations reflect the impact of the reduction in Medicare reimbursement to skilled nursing facilities, which took effect October 1, 2002.
