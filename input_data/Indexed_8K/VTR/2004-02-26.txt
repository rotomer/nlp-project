 Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") said today that normalized Funds From Operations ("FFO") for the 2003 fourth quarter rose 33 percent to $32.3 million, compared with $24.2 million in the comparable 2002 period. Normalized FFO per diluted share increased 18 percent to $0.40 from $0.34 per diluted share for the comparable 2002 period. In the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2003, the Company had 81.2 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, compared to 71.2 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding a year earlier.
LOUISVILLE, Ky (February 26, 2004)
 
The quarter benefited from increased rents resulting from Ventas's annual lease escalations, income from the Company's 2002 investments with Trans Healthcare, Inc. ("THI"), decreased interest expense due to lower debt balances and the early pay-off of the United States Settlement.
 
Normalized FFO per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $1.54, a 13 percent increase from the year ended December 31, 2002 level of $1.36 per diluted share. Normalized FFO for 2003 grew 29 percent year-over-year, to $123.5 million in 2003 from $95.6 million in 2002.
 
Normalized FFO for all periods excludes (a) gains on sales of common stock in the Company's primary tenant, Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (NASDAQ:KIND) ("Kindred"), (b) the benefit of a $20.2 million reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability, which was recorded as income in the first quarter of 2003, (c) losses from early extinguishment of debt and (d) a one-time swap breakage expense incurred in connection with the Company's debt refinancing in April 2002.
 
"In the fourth quarter, Ventas was hitting on all cylinders," Ventas Chairman, President and CEO Debra A. Cafaro said. "Our strategic diversification program moved forward with our announcement of the acquisition of ElderTrust (NYSE:ETT), which closed February 5, 2004. We also completed the sale of ten underperforming facilities to Kindred, generating $85 million in proceeds," she added. "Our shareholders are benefiting from our double-digit FFO per share growth. We will continue to manage the Company to deliver consistent, superior total shareholder return while we broaden the Company's tenant and asset base."
 
GAAP NET INCOME
 
After discontinued operations of $61.8 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, Ventas reported fourth quarter 2003 net income of $77.1 million, or $0.95 per diluted share. After discontinued operations of $1.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, net income for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2002 was $9.4 million, or $0.13 per diluted share. A breakdown of discontinued operations is included in a schedule attached to this Press Release.

After discontinued operations of $66.0 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $162.8 million, or $2.03 per diluted share. Net income for the year ended 2002 was $65.7 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, after discontinued operations of $28.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share.
 
DIVIDEND INCREASE
 
Ventas also said its Board of Directors voted to increase the Company's first quarter 2004 dividend to $0.325 per share, an increase of 21.5 percent from the quarterly dividend of $0.2675 it paid for 2003. The first quarter 2004 dividend is payable on March 25, 2004 to stockholders of record on March 15, 2004.
 
"We are delighted to begin the year by increasing our dividend by over 21 percent," Cafaro said. "We want to share the benefits of our cash flow growth with our shareholders and at the same time maintain a conservative, secure dividend payout ratio of approximately 75 percent of anticipated 2004 FFO."

FOURTH QUARTER 2003 RESULTS
 
Revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 was $50.5 million, of which $47.4 million (or 93.7 percent) resulted from leases with Kindred. Fourth quarter expenses totaled $35.3 million, and included $9.9 million of depreciation expense, $15.9 million of interest expense on debt financing and $5.2 million loss on swap breakage. General, administrative and professional expenses for the 2003 fourth quarter totaled $3.9 million.
 
2003 RESULTS
 
Revenue for 2003 was $205.0 million, of which $183.2 million (or 89.4 percent) resulted from leases with Kindred. Expenses of $108.3 million for the year were reduced by the $20.2 million reversal of a contingent liability and included $39.7 million of depreciation expense, $61.8 million of interest expense and $4.9 million of interest expense on the United States Settlement, which was paid in full in June 2003 without prepayment penalty or premium. General and administrative and professional expenses for the year totaled $15.2 million.
 
VENTAS AFFIRMS 2004 NORMALIZED FFO GUIDANCE
 
Ventas affirmed its 2004 normalized FFO guidance of between $1.70 and $1.74 per diluted share. If achieved, these results would represent approximately 12 percent per share growth in normalized FFO in 2004. The Company's guidance includes the impact of the recently completed merger with ElderTrust and the acquisition and leasing of the remaining seven Brookdale properties that are currently under contract for purchase. There can be no assurance that the remaining Brookdale transactions will occur or when they will occur. Any failure or delay in completing these transactions will reduce the amount of 2004 FFO Ventas expects to achieve. Consistent with its practice, Ventas's FFO guidance (and related GAAP earnings projections) for 2004 exclude the impact of additional acquisitions and divestitures, gains and losses on the sales of assets, and capital transactions. Its guidance also excludes the future impact of (a) any expense the Company records for non-cash "swap ineffectiveness," and (b) any expenses related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses or premiums incurred as a result of early debt retirement.
 
Reconciliation of the Company's normalized FFO guidance to the Company's projected GAAP earnings is provided on a schedule attached to this Press Release. The Company may from time to time update its publicly announced FFO guidance, but it is not obligated to do so.
 
ASSUMPTIONS AND QUALIFICATIONS
 
The declaration and payment of future dividends remains subject to the oversight and approval of the Company's Board of Directors and is generally reviewed quarterly. The Company may from time to time update its publicly announced expectations regarding future dividends but it is not obligated to do so.
 
The Company's FFO guidance and expectation regarding future dividends are based on a number of assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve the projected FFO results or the timing or amount of future dividends.

Projected FFO per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2004:
 
 
Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT and uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis.
 
FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP")), as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this Press Release.

Net Debt to EBITDA
 
Earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") and Normalized EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 (dollars in thousands):
 
 
The Company considers EBITDA a profitability measure which indicates the Company's ability to service debt. Normalized EBITDA excludes income and expense items that are nonrecurring in the Company's core business. The Company considers the Net Debt to EBITDA ratio a useful measure to evaluate the Company's ability to pay its indebtedness. EBITDA presented herein is not necessarily comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is EBITDA necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this Press Release.
