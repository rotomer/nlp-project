Such forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and security holders must recognize that actual results may differ from the Company's expectations. The Company does not undertake a duty to update such forward-looking statements.

Factors that may affect the plans or results of the Company include, without limitation, (a) the ability and willingness of Kindred Healthcare, Inc. ("Kindred") and certain of its affiliates to continue to meet and/or perform their obligations under their contractual arrangements with the Company and the Company's subsidiaries, including without limitation the lease agreements and various agreements entered into by the Company and Kindred at the time of the Company's spin off of Kindred on May 1, 1998 (the "1998 Spin Off"), as such agreements may have been amended and restated in connection with Kindred's emergence from bankruptcy on April 20, 2001, (b) the ability and willingness of Kindred to continue to meet and/or perform its obligation to indemnify and defend the Company for all litigation and other claims relating to the healthcare operations and other assets and liabilities transferred to Kindred in the 1998 Spin Off, (c) the ability of Kindred and the Company's other operators to maintain the financial strength and liquidity necessary to satisfy their respective

Many of such factors are beyond the control of the Company and its management. Item 7.

Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated Ladies and Gentlemen: Ventas, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") and Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership ("Ventas Realty") confirm their respective agreements with Merrill Lynch & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("Merrill Lynch"), with respect to the issue and sale by the Company and the purchase by Merrill Lynch of 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $.25 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock"). The aforesaid 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock to be purchased by Merrill Lynch are hereinafter called the "Securities". The Company and Ventas Realty understand that Merrill Lynch proposes to make a public offering of the Securities as soon as Merrill Lynch deems it advisable after this Agreement has been executed and delivered. The Company and Ventas Capital Corporation, Ventas LP Realty, L.L.C. and Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership, Ventas Healthcare Properties Inc. and Ventas TRS LLC (collectively, the "Co-Registrants") have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-107942) and pre-effective amendment no. 1 thereto for the registration of the Securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations"). Such registration statement has been declared effective by the Commission and the Company has filed such post-effective amendments thereto as may be required prior to the execution of this Agreement and each such post-effective amendment has been declared effective by the Commission. Promptly after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will prepare and file a prospectus together with a prospectus supplement in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of Rule 424 ("Rule 424(b)") of the 1933 Act Regulations. Such registration statement, including the exhibits thereto, schedules thereto, if any, and the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act, at the time it became effective is herein referred to together as, the "Registration Statement." Any registration statement filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations is herein 1
referred to as the "Rule 462(b) Registration Statement," and after such filing the term "Registration Statement" shall include the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement. The final prospectus and the final prospectus supplement, including the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act, in the form first furnished to Merrill Lynch for use in connection with the offering of the Securities are herein collectively called the "Prospectus." For purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing shall be deemed to include the copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("EDGAR"). For purposes of this Agreement, references to amendments to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to include registration statements containing combined prospectuses pursuant to Rule 429 of the 1933 Act Regulations that include securities registered pursuant to the 1933 Act and amendments thereto. All references in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is "contained," "included" or "stated" in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (or other references of like import) shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as the case may be; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include the filing of any document under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act") which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as the case may be. SECTION 1. Representations and Warranties. (a) Representations and Warranties by the Company. The Company and Ventas Realty represent and warrant to Merrill Lynch as of the date hereof, as of the Closing Time referred to in Section 2(b) hereof and agree with Merrill Lynch, as follows: (i) Compliance with Registration Requirements. The Company and the Co-Registrants meet the requirements for use of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act. The Registration Statement and any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement has become effective under the 1933 Act and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement has been issued under the 1933 Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, are contemplated by the Commission, and any request on the part of the Commission for additional information has been complied with. At the time the Registration Statement, any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement and any post-effective amendments thereto became effective and at the Closing Time, the Registration Statement, the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement and any amendments and supplements thereto complied and will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations and did not and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. Neither the Prospectus nor any amendments or supplements thereto, at the time the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement was issued and at the Closing Time, included or will 2
include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The representations and warranties in this subsection shall not apply to statements in or omissions from the Registration Statement or Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company in writing by Merrill Lynch expressly for use in the Registration Statement or Prospectus. The prospectus filed as part of the Registration Statement as originally filed or as part of any amendment thereto, or filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the 1933 Act, complied when so filed in all material respects with the 1933 Act Regulations and the Prospectus delivered to Merrill Lynch for use in connection with this offering was identical to the electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T. (ii) Capitalization. As of December 31, 2003 the Company had an authorized capitalization as set forth in the Prospectus in the column entitled "Actual" in the row labeled "Common Stock" under the caption "Capitalization." All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of the Company (other than the failure to authorize the issuance of shares in uncertificated form) have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and were not issued in violation of any preemptive or similar right; provided that the Company shall, prior to the Closing Time, authorize and approve the issuance of shares in uncertificated form. Attached as Schedule B is a true and complete list identifying each subsidiary (as defined in the 1933 Act) of the Company, its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation, its direct or indirect percentage equity ownership by the Company (all such entities, the "Subsidiaries"). All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of each of the Subsidiaries have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and (except in the case of general partnership interests) nonassessable, were not issued in violation of any preemptive or similar right and, except as set forth in the Prospectus or on Schedule B, are owned by the Company, directly or indirectly through one or more Subsidiaries, free and clear of all Liens other than Liens (i) that will be discharged on or prior to the Closing Date or (ii) that are described in the Prospectus and secure indebtedness described in the Prospectus. Except as set forth on Schedule B, there are no outstanding options, warrants or other rights to acquire or purchase, or instruments convertible into or exchangeable for, any shares of capital stock of any of the Subsidiaries. No holder of any securities of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is entitled to have such securities registered (i) under the Registration Statement that have not been so registered or waived, or (ii) subsequent to the date hereof pursuant to any agreement not described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, except as disclosed in writing to Merrill Lynch. "Lien" means, with respect to any asset, any mortgage, lien, pledge, charge, security interest or encumbrance of any kind in respect of such asset, whether or not filed, recorded or otherwise perfected under applicable law, including any conditional sale or other title retention agreement, any lease in the nature thereof, any option or other agreement to sell or give a security interest in and any filing of or agreement to give any financing statement under the Uniform Commercial Code (or equivalent statutes) of any jurisdiction. 3
(iii) Authorization and Description of Securities. The Securities to be purchased by Merrill Lynch from the Company have been duly authorized for issuance and sale to Merrill Lynch pursuant to this Agreement and, when issued and delivered by the Company pursuant to this Agreement against payment of the consideration set forth herein, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable; the Common Stock conforms in all material respects to all statements relating thereto contained in the Prospectus and such description conforms in all material respects to the rights set forth in the instruments defining the same; no holder of the Securities will be subject to personal liability by reason of being such a holder; and the issuance of the Securities is not subject to the preemptive or other similar rights of any securityholder of the Company. (iv) Good Standing of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (a) is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has all requisite corporate, partnership or limited liability company power and authority, and has all governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals, necessary to own its property and carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the failure to obtain any such license, authorization, consent and approval is not reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) and (c) is qualified to do business and is in good standing in all jurisdictions in which the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary except where failure to be so qualified and in good standing is not reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). Each of the Company and Ventas Realty has all requisite corporate or partnership power and authority to execute, deliver and perform all of its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. A "Material Adverse Effect" means any material adverse effect on the business, condition (financial or other), results of operations, performance or properties of Ventas and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Except as described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is (A) in default (or, with notice or lapse of time or both, would be in default) in the performance or observance of any obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any bond, debenture, note, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan or credit agreement, lease, license, franchise agreement, authorization, permit, certificate or other agreement or instrument to which any of them is a party or by which any of them is bound or to which any of their assets or properties is subject (collectively, "Agreements and Instruments") or (B) in violation of any law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree of any domestic or foreign court with jurisdiction over any of them or any of their assets or properties or other governmental or regulatory authority, agency or other body, which, in the case of clauses (A) and (B), individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. There exists no 4
condition that, with notice, the passage of time or otherwise, would constitute a default by the Company or any Subsidiary under any such document or instrument or result in the imposition of any penalty or the acceleration of any indebtedness, other than penalties, defaults or conditions that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. (vii) Absence of Defaults and Conflicts Upon Consummation of Offering. None of the issuance, offer and sale of the Securities by the Company, the execution, delivery and performance of the Purchase Agreement by the Company or Ventas Realty or the consummation by the Company or Ventas Realty of the transactions contemplated herein and in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus violate or will violate, conflict with or constitute a breach of any of the terms or provisions of or a default under (or an event that with notice or the lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default), or require consent under, or result in the creation or imposition of a lien, charge, or encumbrance on any property or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to, (i) the charter, bylaws or other constitutive documents of the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) any law, statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary or their respective assets or properties, (iii) any judgment, order or decree of any domestic or foreign court or governmental agency or authority having jurisdiction over the Company or any Subsidiary or their respective assets or properties or (iv) any Agreements or Instruments and except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iv), for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, consents, liens, charges or encumbrances that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. No consents or waivers from any other person or entity are required for the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the issuance and sale of the Securities, other than such consents and waivers as have been obtained or will be obtained prior to the Closing Date and will be in full force and effect. (viii) Absence of Proceedings. Except as set forth in the Registration Statement and Prospectus, there is no action, suit or proceeding before or by any court, arbitrator or governmental agency, body or official, domestic or foreign, now pending or, to the knowledge of the Company or Ventas Realty, threatened or contemplated, to which the Company or any Subsidiary is or may be a party or to which the business, assets or property of such person is or may be subject, that is, (i) individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely (a) to have a Material Adverse Effect, or (b) to interfere with or adversely affect the issuance of the Securities in any jurisdiction or adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Registration Statement, or (ii) that is otherwise required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement. Except as set forth in the Registration Statement and Prospectus, there is (A) no statute, rule, regulation or order that has been enacted, adopted or issued or, to the knowledge of the Company or Ventas Realty, that has been proposed by any governmental body or agency, domestic or foreign or (B) no injunction, restraining order or order of any nature by a federal or state court or foreign court of competent jurisdiction to which the Company or any Subsidiary is or may be subject that (a) is required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement or (b) in the case of clauses (A) and (B) is, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely (1) to have a Material Adverse Effect, (2) to interfere with or adversely affect the issuance of the Securities in any jurisdiction or adversely affect the 5
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Every request of any securities authority or agency of any jurisdiction for additional information with respect to the Securities that has been received by the Company or any Subsidiary or their counsel prior to the date hereof has been, or will prior to the closing date be, complied with in all material respects.

is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect and (B) no knowledge that any governmental body or agency, domestic or foreign, is considering limiting, suspending or revoking any such Authorization, except where any such limitations, suspensions or revocations is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. All such Authorizations are valid and in full force and effect, and the Company and each Subsidiary is in compliance with the terms and conditions of all such Authorizations and with the rules and regulations of the regulatory authorities having jurisdiction with respect to such Authorizations, except for any invalidity, failure to be in full force and effect or noncompliance with any Authorization that is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

To the knowledge of the Company and Ventas Realty, no lessee or sublessee of any portion of any of the properties owned or leased by the Company and/or any Subsidiary is in default under its respective lease and there is no event which, but for the passage of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute a default under any such lease, except as described in the Registration Statement and Prospectus and except for such defaults that are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any notice of infringement of or conflict with (and neither knows of any such infringement or a conflict with) asserted rights of others with respect to any of the foregoing that, if such assertion of infringement or conflict were sustained, is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company and Ventas Realty, the use of the Intellectual Property in connection with the business and operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries does not infringe on the rights of any person, except for such infringement as is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any notice of, and otherwise has no knowledge of, any threatened or existing action, suit, proceeding or claim by any person challenging use of the Intellectual Property by the Company and the Subsidiaries. (xvii) Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes. All tax returns required to be filed by the Company and each Subsidiary have been filed in all jurisdictions where such returns are required to be filed; and all taxes, including withholding taxes, value added and franchise taxes, penalties and interest, assessments, fees and other charges due or claimed to be due from such entities or that are due and payable have been paid, other than those being contested in good faith and for which reserves have been provided in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or those currently payable without penalty or interest and except where the failure to make such required filings or payments is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has knowledge of any material proposed additional tax assessments against the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or their assets or property. (xviii) Certain ERISA matters. Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has any liability for any prohibited transaction or accumulated funding deficiency (within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code) or any complete or partial withdrawal liability with respect to any pension, profit sharing or other plan which is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), to which the Company or any Subsidiary makes or ever has made a contribution and in which any employee of the Company or any Subsidiary is or has ever been a participant. With respect to such plans, the Company and each Subsidiary is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable provisions of ERISA. 8
(xix) Investment Company Act. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is, nor upon the issuance and sale of the Securities as herein contemplated and the application of the net proceeds therefrom as described in the Prospectus will be, an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). (xx) Insurance for Leased Properties. The Company and each Subsidiary maintains or causes to be maintained by the lessee under the leases for its properties insurance covering its properties (including title to its properties), assets, operations, personnel and businesses, and such insurance is of such type and in such amounts in accordance with customary industry practice and in the Company's reasonable judgment sufficient to protect the Company and the Subsidiaries and their businesses. (xxi) Accounting and Other Controls. The Company and each Subsidiary maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that: (A) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations; (B) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of its financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain accountability for assets; (C) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific authorization; and (D) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. (xxii) No Material Adverse Change in Business. As of December 31, 2003, neither the Company nor any subsidiary (as defined in the 1933 Act) of the Company at December 31, 2003 had any material liabilities or obligations, direct or contingent, that were not set forth in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of such date, or in the notes thereto, set forth in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, or otherwise described therein, other than the performance by the Company of its obligations under ordinary course executory contracts that are not in default, that could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and that are not required by GAAP, as modified by the 1933 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Act (the "1934 Act") and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (the "1934 Act Regulations"), to be disclosed on a regularly prepared balance sheet or in the notes thereto. Since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, except as otherwise stated therein, (a) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has (1) incurred any liabilities or obligations, direct or contingent, that is, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, or (2) entered into any material transaction not in the ordinary course of business, (b) there has not been any event or development in respect of the business or condition (financial or other) of the Company and the Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect and (c) there has not been any change in the long-term debt of the Company (other than as a result of transactions disclosed under the caption "Use of Proceeds" in the Prospectus) or any of the Subsidiaries or in the authorized capitalization of the Company. 9

(xxvii) Underwriting. Except as described in the section of the Prospectus entitled "Plan of Distribution," there are no contracts, agreements or understandings between the Company or any Subsidiary and any other person that would give rise to a valid claim against the Company, any Subsidiary or Merrill Lynch for a brokerage 10

(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and (iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by Merrill Lynch), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above; provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by Merrill Lynch expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company or Ventas Realty may otherwise have, including, but not limited to, liability under this Agreement. (b) Indemnification of Company, Directors and Officers. Merrill Lynch agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, Ventas Realty, each of their directors, each of their officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or Ventas Realty within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act and each of their respective agents, employees, officers and directors and the agents, employees, officers and directors of any such controlling person against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions relating to Merrill Lynch, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to Merrill Lynch furnished to the Company or Ventas Realty by Merrill Lynch expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto). 17
(c) Actions against Parties; Notification. Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder, except to the extent it is materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by Merrill Lynch, subject to the reasonable approval of the indemnifying party, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could reasonably be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse. If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement; provided, that an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any such settlement effected without its consent if such indemnifying party (1) reimburses such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable and (2) provides written notice to the indemnified party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement. (e) Other Agreements With Respect to Indemnification. The provisions of this Section shall not affect any agreement between the Company and Ventas Realty with respect to indemnification. SECTION 7. Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party 18
shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and Ventas Realty on the one hand and Merrill Lynch on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and Ventas Realty on the one hand and of Merrill Lynch on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and Ventas Realty on the one hand and Merrill Lynch on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by Merrill Lynch, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company and Ventas Realty, on the one hand and Merrill Lynch on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by Merrill Lynch and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, Ventas Realty and Merrill Lynch agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, Merrill Lynch shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which Merrill Lynch has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls Merrill Lynch within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights 19
to contribution as Merrill Lynch, and each director of the Company, Ventas Realty, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company or Ventas Realty, as the case may be The provisions of this Section shall not affect any agreement among the Company and Ventas Realty with respect to contribution.
