or investments, (e) the nature and extent of future competition, (f) the extent of future healthcare reform and regulation, including cost containment measures and changes in reimbursement policies, procedures and rates, (g) increases in the cost of borrowing for the Company, (h) the ability of the Company's operators to deliver high quality care and to attract patients, (i) the results of litigation affecting the Company, (j) changes in general economic conditions and/or economic conditions in the markets in which the Company may, from time to time, compete, (k) the ability of the Company to pay down, refinance, restructure, and/or extend its indebtedness as it becomes due, (l) the movement of interest rates and the resulting impact on the value of and the accounting for the Company's interest rate swap agreement, (m) the ability and willingness of the Company to maintain its qualification as a REIT due to economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations, (n) final determination of the Company's taxable net income for the years ending December 31, 2003 and 2004, (o) the ability and willingness of the Company's tenants to renew their leases with the Company upon expiration of the leases and the Company's ability to relet its properties on the same or better terms in the event such leases expire and are not renewed by the existing tenants, and (p) the impact on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of Kindred and the Company's other operators resulting from increased operating costs and uninsured liabilities for professional liability claims, and the ability of Kindred and the Company's other operators to accurately estimate the magnitude of such liabilities. Many of such factors are beyond the control of the Company and its management.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

 Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") said today that first quarter normalized Funds From Operations ("FFO") rose 22 percent to $34.0 million compared with $27.9 million in the first quarter 2003. Normalized FFO per diluted share increased 17 percent to $0.41 from $0.35 per diluted share for the comparable 2003 period. In the first quarter ended March 31, 2004, the Company had 82.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, compared to 79.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding a year earlier.
LOUISVILLE, Ky (April 28, 2004)
 
The quarter benefited from increased rents resulting from Ventas's annual lease escalations, its acquisitions during the quarter of 32 high quality assets, increased rent from the July 1, 2003 amendments to the Kindred Master Leases, and decreased interest expense due to the early pay-off of its settlement with the United States Department of Justice.
 
Normalized FFO for all periods excludes (a) the benefit of a $20.2 million reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability, which was recorded as income in the first quarter of 2003, (b) losses from early extinguishment of debt, and (c) gains on sales of common stock in the Company's primary tenant, Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (NASDAQ:KIND) ("Kindred").
 
"Our first quarter was exceptional as we closed on $276 million of acquisitions, reflecting the addition of 32 high quality assets and five new tenants to our growing portfolio and business platform," Ventas Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Debra A. Cafaro said. "Our acquisition pipeline remains active and, aided by the capital we successfully raised during the first quarter, we remain confident of our ability to further grow and diversify our portfolio in 2004."
 
GAAP NET INCOME
 
Ventas reported first quarter 2004 net income of $23.3 million, or $0.28 per diluted share. Including a benefit of $20.2 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, resulting from the reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability, net income for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003 was $37.3 million, or $0.47 per diluted share after discontinued operations of $1.4 million, or $0.02 per diluted share.

FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS AND OTHER RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FIRST QUARTER 2004 RESULTS
 
Rental revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 was $53.2 million, of which $47.4 million (or 88.9 percent) resulted from leases with Kindred. First quarter expenses totaled $31.0 million, and included $10.9 million of depreciation expense and $15.3 million of total interest expense. General, administrative and professional expenses for the 2004 first quarter totaled $4.3 million.
 
VENTAS AFFIRMS 2004 NORMALIZED FFO GUIDANCE
 
Ventas affirmed its 2004 normalized FFO guidance of between $1.70 and $1.74 per diluted share. If achieved, these results would represent approximately 12 percent growth in normalized FFO per share in 2004.
 
Consistent with its practice, Ventas's FFO guidance (and related GAAP earnings projections) for 2004 exclude the impact of additional acquisitions and divestitures, gains and losses on the sales of assets, and capital transactions. Its guidance also excludes the future impact of (a) any expense the Company records for non-cash "swap ineffectiveness," and (b) any expenses related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses or premiums incurred as a result of early debt retirement.
 
Reconciliation of the Company's normalized FFO guidance to the Company's projected GAAP earnings is provided on a schedule attached to this Press Release. The Company may from time to time update its publicly announced FFO guidance, but it is not obligated to do so.
 
ASSUMPTIONS AND QUALIFICATIONS
 
The Company's FFO guidance and expectation regarding future dividends are based on a number of assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve the projected FFO results or the timing or amount of future dividends.

Projected FFO per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2004:
 
 
Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT and uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis.
 
FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP")), as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this Press Release.

Net Debt to EBITDA
 
Earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") and Normalized EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands):
 
 
The Company considers EBITDA a profitability measure which indicates the Company's ability to service debt. Normalized EBITDA excludes income and expense items that are nonrecurring in the Company's core business. The Company considers the Net Debt to EBITDA ratio a useful measure to evaluate the Company's ability to pay its indebtedness. EBITDA presented herein is not necessarily comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is EBITDA necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this Press Release.
