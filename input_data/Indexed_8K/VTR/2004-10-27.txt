Many of such factors are beyond the control of the Company and its management.

 Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") said today that third quarter 2004 normalized Funds from Operations ("FFO") rose 24 percent to $39.8 million, compared with $32.2 million in the third quarter 2003. Normalized FFO per diluted share in the third quarter 2004 increased 18 percent to $0.47 from $0.40 per diluted share for the comparable 2003 period. In the third quarter ended September 30, 2004, the Company had 84.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, compared to 80.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding a year earlier.
LOUISVILLE, KY (October 27, 2004)
 
Normalized FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 was $111.6 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, a 22 percent increase from $91.3 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, for the comparable 2003 period.
 
Normalized FFO for all periods excludes the benefit of a $20.2 million reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability, which increased operating income in the first quarter of 2003, an $8.1 million and a $9.0 million gain on sales of common stock of the Company's primary tenant, Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:KND) ("Kindred"), which the Company realized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003, respectively, and a $1.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt recognized during the third quarter of 2004 due to the Company's refinancing of its credit facility.
 
The third quarter and first nine months of 2004 benefited from the Company's recent acquisition activity and increased rent from its master lease agreements with Kindred.
 
"Our shareholders will benefit from another quarter of excellent growth. Normalized FFO rose 18 percent per share and we improved our future earnings power by completing two important capital markets transactions," Chairman, President and CEO Debra A. Cafaro said. "With our

new bank facility and senior note offering completed on attractive terms, Ventas has a strong platform to support its further investment in healthcare and senior housing assets and enhance its ability to create long-term value for shareholders."

THIRD QUARTER 2004 RESULTS
 
Rental revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 was $60.7 million, of which $49.0 million (or 80.7 percent) resulted from leases with Kindred. Third quarter expenses totaled $36.3 million, and included $13.3 million of depreciation expense and $16.9 million of interest expense. General and administrative and professional expenses for the 2004 third quarter totaled $4.0 million. Property level operating expenses for the period were $0.4 million.
 
NINE MONTH 2004 RESULTS
 
Rental revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 was $172.6 million, of which $144.8 million (or 83.9 percent) resulted from leases with Kindred. Expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 totaled $101.4 million and included $36.2 million of depreciation expense, $49.3 million of interest expense and $12.8 million of general and administrative and professional expenses. Property level operating expenses for the period were $0.9 million.
 
VENTAS UPDATES 2004 NORMALIZED FFO GUIDANCE AND ISSUES 2005 GUIDANCE
 
Ventas also stated that it expects 2004 normalized FFO to be between $1.78 and $1.80 per diluted share, updated from the previous guidance of $1.75 to $1.79 per diluted share.
 
The Company also said it expects to achieve 2005 normalized FFO of between $1.89 and $1.93 per diluted share.
 
The Company's normalized FFO guidance assumes that all of the Company's tenants and borrowers continue to meet all of their obligations to the Company and that the Company closes all acquisitions currently subject to contract and/or non-binding letters of intent by March 31, 2005. There can be no assurance that these transactions will occur or when they will occur. Any failure or delay in completing these transactions could reduce the amount of 2004 and 2005 FFO that Ventas actually achieves.

In addition to the previously stated assumptions, the Company's normalized FFO guidance (and related GAAP earnings projections) for all periods exclude gains and losses on the sales of assets, and the impact of additional, unannounced future acquisitions, divestitures and capital transactions. Its guidance also excludes the future impact of (a) any expense the Company records for non-cash "swap ineffectiveness," and (b) any expenses related to asset impairment, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses or premiums incurred as a result of early debt retirement.
 
The Company's normalized FFO guidance is based on a number of other assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results. Reconciliation of the Company's normalized FFO guidance to the Company's projected GAAP earnings is provided on a schedule attached to this Press Release. The Company may from time to time update its publicly announced normalized FFO guidance, but it is not obligated to do so.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT and uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.
 
FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) or as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this Press Release.

Pro Forma Net Debt to EBITDA
 
The following pro forma information considers the effect on net income, interest and depreciation as if the Company had consummated the acquisition of the six properties during the third quarter 2004 as of the beginning of the three month period ended September 30, 2004. The following table illustrates net debt to pro forma earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") for the three months ended September 30, 2004 (dollars in thousands):
 
 
The Company considers EBITDA a profitability measure which indicates the Company's ability to service debt. The Company considers the Net Debt to EBITDA ratio a useful measure to evaluate the Company's ability to pay its indebtedness. EBITDA presented herein is not necessarily comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is EBITDA necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this Press Release.

Kindred Coverage Ratios
 
The following is based on data provided by Kindred to the Company or obtained from Kindred's public filings. This information reflects Kindred's EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverage by Master Lease:
 
 
1
Trailing Twelve Months EBITDARM and EBITDAR for the period ended June 30, 2004 (the latest available data provided by Kindred) to the Company's Trailing Twelve Months cash rental revenue.
 
2
Coverage reflects the ratio of Kindred's EBITDARM to rent. EBITDARM is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent. In the calculation of Trailing Twelve Months EBITDARM, intercompany profit pertaining to Kindred's new PeopleFirst Rehabilitation Division for the six months ended June 30, 2004 has been eliminated from purchased ancillary expenses within the Ventas skilled nursing portfolio.
 
3
Coverage reflects the ratio of Kindred's EBITDAR to rent. EBITDAR is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent but after deducting a five percent management fee. In the calculation of Trailing Twelve Months EBITDAR, intercompany profit pertaining to Kindred's new PeopleFirst Rehabilitation Division for the six months ended June 30, 2004 has been eliminated from purchased ancillary expenses within the Ventas skilled nursing portfolio.
