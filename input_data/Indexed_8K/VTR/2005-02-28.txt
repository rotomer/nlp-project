Many of such factors are beyond the control of the Company and its management.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") said today that fourth quarter 2004 normalized Funds from Operations ("FFO") rose 24 percent to $40.1 million, compared with $32.3 million in the fourth quarter 2003. Normalized FFO per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2004 increased 18 percent to $0.47 from $0.40 per diluted share for the comparable 2003 period. In the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2004, the Company had 85.2 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, compared to 81.2 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding a year earlier.
LOUISVILLE, KY (February 28, 2005)
 
Normalized FFO per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $1.80, a 17 percent increase from the year ended December 31, 2003 level of $1.54 per diluted share. Normalized FFO for 2004 grew 23 percent year-over-year, to $151.7 million in 2004 from $123.5 million in 2003.
 
Normalized FFO for all periods excludes the benefit of a $20.2 million reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability that increased operating income in the first quarter of 2003, a $9.0 million gain on sales of common stock of the Company's primary tenant, Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:KND) ("Kindred"), which the Company realized during the year ended December 31, 2003, and a $1.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt recognized during the third quarter of 2004 due to the Company's refinancing of its credit facility.
 
Results for the fourth quarter and full year benefited from the Company's accelerated investment activity and increased rent from its diversified portfolio of quality healthcare and senior housing assets.
 
Ventas also said that its Board of Directors voted to increase the Company's first quarter 2005 dividend to $0.36 per share, an increase of 11 percent from the quarterly 2004 dividend of $0.325. The Ventas first quarter dividend is payable April 5, 2005 to stockholders of record on March 24, 2005.
 
"Ventas delivered another excellent year of performance for its shareholders. In 2004, we again produced double-digit FFO growth. Our $400 million of accretive acquisitions added to our strong internal growth rate and diversified our tenant and asset base," Ventas Chairman, President and CEO Debra A. Cafaro said. "Ventas was the best performing REIT in the Morgan Stanley REIT Index (RMS) for the five year period ended December 31, 2004, with a compound annual total shareholder return of over 59 percent.

"We are beginning 2005 on a positive note by increasing our quarterly dividend 11 percent. This increase shares the benefits of our strong and reliable cash flow with our shareholders and indicates our confidence in our assets, our revenue stream and our industry," Cafaro said. "Looking ahead, we remain committed to managing the Company to deliver long-term shareholder value and superior risk adjusted return."

VENTAS AFFIRMS 2005 NORMALIZED FFO GUIDANCE
 
Ventas affirmed its 2005 normalized FFO guidance between $1.89 and $1.93 per diluted share. The Company's normalized FFO guidance assumes that all of the Company's tenants and borrowers continue to meet all of their obligations to the Company. In addition, the Company's normalized FFO guidance (and related GAAP earnings projections) excludes gains and losses on the sales of assets and the impact of future acquisitions, divestitures and capital transactions. Its guidance also excludes the future impact of (a) any expense the Company records for non-cash "swap ineffectiveness," and (b) any expenses related to asset impairment, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses or premiums incurred as a result of early debt retirement.
 
The Company's normalized FFO guidance is based on a number of other assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.
 
Reconciliation of the Company's normalized FFO guidance to the Company's projected GAAP earnings is provided on a schedule attached to this Press Release. The Company may from time to time update its publicly announced normalized FFO guidance, but it is not obligated to do so.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT and uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.
 
FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) or as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this Press Release.

Pro Forma Net Debt to EBITDA
 
The following pro forma information considers the effect on net income, interest and depreciation as if the Company had consummated the acquisition of two properties and the sale of two properties during the fourth quarter 2004 as of the beginning of the three month period ended December 31, 2004. The following table illustrates net debt to pro forma earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") for the three months ended December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands):
 
 
The Company considers EBITDA a profitability measure which indicates the Company's ability to service debt. The Company considers the Net Debt to EBITDA ratio a useful measure to evaluate the Company's ability to pay its indebtedness. EBITDA presented herein is not necessarily comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is EBITDA necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this Press Release.
