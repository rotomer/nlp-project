A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated in this Item 2.02 by reference.
 
The press release states that the Company's normalized funds from operations ("FFO") for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 were $40.7 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, as compared to $34.0 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. The Company's net income for the first quarter of 2005 was $27.6 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, as compared to $23.3 million, or $0.28 per diluted share (after discontinued operations of $0.2 million), for the comparable period in 2004.
 
The press release also states that, excluding the impact of the Company's proposed acquisition of Provident Senior Living Trust, the Company expects its normalized FFO for the year ending December 31, 2005 to be between $1.94 and $1.96 per diluted share, updated from its previous guidance of $1.89 to $1.93 per diluted share, and its net income for 2005 to be between $1.30 and $1.32 per diluted share.

Such forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and security holders must recognize that actual results may differ from the Company's expectations.

Actual future results and trends for the Company may differ materially depending on a variety of factors discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Factors that may affect the plans or results of the Company include, without limitation, (a) the ability and willingness of Kindred Healthcare, Inc. ("Kindred") and certain of its affiliates to continue to meet and/or perform their obligations under their contractual arrangements with the Company and the Company's subsidiaries, including without limitation the lease agreements and various agreements entered into by the Company and Kindred at the time of the Company's spin off of Kindred on May 1, 1998 (the "1998 Spin Off"), as such agreements may have been amended and restated in connection with Kindred's emergence from
 
bankruptcy on April 20, 2001, (b) the ability and willingness of Kindred to continue to meet and/or perform its obligation to indemnify and defend the Company for all litigation and other claims relating to the healthcare operations and other assets and liabilities transferred to Kindred in the 1998 Spin Off, (c) the ability of Kindred and the Company's other operators, tenants and borrowers to maintain the financial strength and liquidity necessary to satisfy their respective obligations and duties under the leases and other agreements with the Company, and their existing credit agreements, (d) the Company's success in implementing its business strategy and the Company's ability to identify, underwrite, finance, consummate and integrate diversifying acquisitions or investments, (e) the nature and extent of future competition, (f) the extent of future healthcare reform and regulation, including cost containment measures and changes in reimbursement policies, procedures and rates, (g) increases in the cost of borrowing for the Company, (h) the ability of the Company's operators to deliver high quality care and to attract patients, (i) the results of litigation affecting the Company, (j) changes in general economic conditions and/or economic conditions in the markets in which the Company may, from time to time, compete, (k) the ability of the Company to pay down, refinance, restructure, and/or extend its indebtedness as it becomes due, (l) the movement of interest rates and the resulting impact on the value of and the accounting for the Company's interest rate swap agreement, (m) the ability and willingness of the Company to maintain its qualification as a REIT due to economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations, (n) final determination of the Company's taxable net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 and for the year ending December 31, 2005, (o) the ability and willingness of the Company's tenants to renew their leases with the Company upon expiration of the leases and the Company's ability to relet its properties on the same or better terms in the event such leases expire and are not renewed by the existing tenants, (p) risks associated with the Company's proposed acquisition of Provident Senior Living Trust, including its ability to successfully complete the merger on the contemplated terms and to timely and fully realize expected revenues and cost savings therefrom, (q) the impact on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of Kindred and the Company's other operators resulting from increased operating costs and uninsured liabilities for professional liability claims, and the ability of Kindred and the Company's other operators to accurately estimate the magnitude of such liabilities, and (r) the value of the Company's rental reset right with Kindred, which is dependent on a variety of factors and is highly speculative. Many of such factors are beyond the control of the Company and its management.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") said today that first quarter 2005 normalized Funds from Operations ("FFO") rose 19.7 percent to $40.7 million, compared with $34.0 million in the first quarter 2004. Normalized FFO per diluted share in the first quarter 2005 increased 17.1 percent to $0.48 from $0.41 per diluted share for the comparable 2004 period. In the first quarter ended March 31, 2005, the Company had 85.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, compared to 82.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding a year earlier.
LOUISVILLE, KY (April 28, 2005)
 
Results for the first quarter benefited from increased rent resulting from the Company's accelerated investment activity and increased rent from its diversified portfolio of quality healthcare and senior housing assets.
 
"We are again delighted to report double-digit growth with the 17 percent increase in first quarter FFO," Chairman, President and CEO Debra A. Cafaro said. "Emphasis on implementing our growth and diversification program was highlighted by the mid-April announcement of our $1.2 billion agreement to acquire Provident Senior Living Trust ("Provident") which, combined with other recent acquisitions, will give us over 360 properties in 41 states. Our strategic goals remain directed at producing superior risk adjusted return for our shareholders in the short term and building value for the long term," she added.
 
GAAP NET INCOME
 
Net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 was $27.6 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared with net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 of $23.3 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, after discontinued operations of $0.2 million.

FIRST QUARTER 2005 RESULTS
 
Rental revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 was $62.7 million, of which $48.7 million resulted from leases with Kindred. First quarter expenses totaled $36.4 million and included $13.3 million of depreciation expense and $17.2 million of interest expense. Combined general, administrative and professional fees totaled $5.0 million. Property-level operating expenses relating to the Company's medical office building portfolio for the period were $0.6 million.
 
VENTAS UPDATES 2005 NORMALIZED FFO GUIDANCE
 
Excluding the impact of the Provident acquisition, Ventas expects 2005 normalized FFO to be between $1.94 and $1.96 per diluted share, updated from the previous guidance of $1.89 to $1.93 per diluted share. As previously stated in Ventas's April 12 press release announcing the Provident acquisition, Ventas expects to issue updated normalized FFO guidance following the closing of that transaction. The Company's normalized FFO guidance assumes that all of the Company's tenants and borrowers continue to meet all of their obligations to the Company. In addition, the Company's normalized FFO guidance (and related GAAP earnings projections) excludes gains and losses on the sales of assets and the impact of future acquisitions (including the pending Provident merger), divestitures and capital transactions. Its guidance also excludes the future impact of (a) any expense the Company records for non-cash "swap ineffectiveness," and (b) any expenses related to asset impairment, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses or premiums incurred as a result of early debt retirement.
 
The Company's normalized FFO guidance is based on a number of other assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.
 
Reconciliation of the Company's normalized FFO guidance to the Company's projected GAAP earnings is provided on a schedule attached to this press release. The Company may from time to time update its publicly announced normalized FFO guidance, but it is not obligated to do so.

Funds from Operations
 
FFO and normalized FFO for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 (in thousands, except per share amounts):
 
 
Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO and Funds Available for Distribution ("FAD") appropriate measures of performance of an equity REIT. The Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FAD represents FFO excluding non-cash straight-line rental adjustments.
 
FFO and FAD presented herein are not necessarily comparable to FFO and FAD presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO and FAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) or as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO or FAD necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO and FAD should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.

Projected FFO per diluted share for the year ending December 31, 2005:
 
The following table illustrates the Company's projected FFO per diluted share guidance for the year ending December 31, 2005 excluding the pending Provident acquisition. Ventas expects to issue updated normalized FFO guidance following the closing of the Provident acquisition.

Pro Forma Net Debt to EBITDA
 
The following pro forma information considers the effect on net income, interest and depreciation of the Company's acquisitions and loan investments that were completed during the three months ended March 31, 2005, as if the transactions had consummated as of the beginning of the period. The following table illustrates net debt to pro forma earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") for the three months ended March 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands):
 
 
The Company considers EBITDA a profitability measure which indicates the Company's ability to service debt. The Company considers the Net Debt to EBITDA ratio a useful measure to evaluate the Company's ability to pay its indebtedness. EBITDA presented herein is not necessarily comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is EBITDA necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
