The Operating Partnership, Capital Corp., Ventas and LLC are referred to herein sometimes individually as a "Ventas Entity" and collectively as the "Ventas Entities."

% Senior Notes due 2015 (the "2015 Original Notes") and (ii) $175,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6% Senior Notes due 2010 (the "2010 Original Notes" and, together with the 2015 Original Notes, the "Original Notes"). The 2015 Original Notes and 2010 Original Notes will be issued under separate indentures (each an "Indenture" and together, the "Indentures") among the Issuers, Ventas, the Guarantors (defined below) and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). The Issuers' obligations under the Original Notes and each Indenture will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally (the "Guarantees"), by Ventas and its direct or indirect subsidiaries identified as guarantors on Schedule B hereto (Ventas, together with such direct and indirect subsidiaries, the "Guarantors"). Assuming the Acquisition (as defined below) occurs, the Original Notes will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, in accordance with each Indenture by VTRP Merger Sub, LLC ("VTRP Merger Sub") and the direct or indirect subsidiaries of Provident (as defined below) identified as guarantors on Schedule C hereto (such direct and indirect subsidiaries, the
 
"Provident Guarantors"). All references herein to the Original Notes, the Exchange Notes (as defined below) or the Notes (as defined below) include the related guarantees, unless the context otherwise requires. Notes issued in book-entry form will be issued in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") pursuant to a DTC Agreement, to be dated at or prior to the Closing Time (as defined in Section 2 hereof) (the "DTC Agreement"), between the Issuers and DTC.
 
Ventas has entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated April 12, 2005 (the "Merger Agreement") with VTRP Merger Sub and Provident Senior Living Trust ("Provident"), which provides for the acquisition (the "Acquisition") of Provident by Ventas. If the Acquisition is consummated, the net proceeds of the issuance of the Original Notes will be used to finance a portion of the Acquisition and following the consummation of the Acquisition and in accordance with the terms of the Indentures, each of VTRP Merger Sub and the Provident Guarantors will execute a supplemental indenture to each Indenture whereby it will fully and unconditionally guarantee the Issuers' obligations under the Notes (as defined below) and the Indentures. If the Acquisition is not consummated, the net proceeds will be used to repay a portion of the Operating Partnership's outstanding indebtedness under its revolving credit facility and certain of Ventas' subsidiaries' commercial mortgage-backed securities arrangement. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that, as of the date hereof (i) no Ventas Entity controls (as such term is defined in Rule 405 of the 1933 Act) Provident or any of its Affiliates (as defined below) and (ii) neither Provident nor any of its Affiliates has any written contractual obligation to any Ventas Entity other than in connection with the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and (iii) neither the Ventas entities nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized Provident or any of its Affiliates to act on their respective behalf in connection with the offering contemplated by this Purchase Agreement (this "Agreement").
 
The Original Notes will be offered and sold to the Initial Purchasers pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"). The Ventas Entities have prepared (i) a preliminary offering memorandum, dated May 23, 2005 (the "Preliminary Offering Memorandum"), relating to the Ventas Entities, Provident, the Acquisition and the 2015 Original Notes and (ii) a final offering memorandum, dated the date hereof (the "Offering Memorandum"), relating to the Ventas Entities, Provident, the Acquisition and the Original Notes.
 
The Initial Purchasers have advised the Issuers that the Initial Purchasers intend, as soon as they deem practicable after this Agreement has been executed and delivered, to resell (the "Exempt Resales") the Original Notes purchased by the Initial Purchasers under this Agreement in private sales exempt from registration under the 1933 Act on the terms set forth in the Offering Memorandum, as amended or supplemented, solely to (i) persons whom the Initial Purchasers reasonably believe to be "qualified institutional buyers," as defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act ("QIBs"), pursuant to Rule 144A under the 1933 Act and (ii) other eligible purchasers pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States within the meaning of Regulation S promulgated under the 1933 Act ("Regulation S") pursuant to Regulation S. The persons specified in clauses (i) and (ii) are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the "Eligible Purchasers."
 
Upon the issuance of the Original Notes and until such time as the same is no longer required under the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, the Original Notes shall bear the legend relating thereto set forth under "Notice to investors" in the Offering Memorandum.
 
Holders (including subsequent transferees) of the Original Notes will have the registration rights set forth in the registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") to be dated the Closing Time (as defined in Section 2(b) hereof) substantially in the form as described in the Offering Memorandum. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Ventas Entities and the Guarantors will agree to (i) file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the circumstances set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement, (a) a registration statement under the 1933 Act (the "Exchange Offer Registration Statement") relating to two new issues of debt securities (collectively with the Private Exchange Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), the "Exchange Notes" and, together with the Original Notes, the "Notes") to be offered in exchange for the Original Notes (the "Exchange Offer") and issued under the applicable Indenture or an indenture substantially identical to such Indenture and/or (b) a shelf registration statement pursuant to Rule 415 under the 1933 Act (the "Shelf Registration Statement" and, together with the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, the "Registration Statements") relating to the resale by certain holders of the Original Notes, and (ii) to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statements to be declared effective. This Agreement, the Original Notes, the Exchange Notes, the Guarantees, the Exchange Note Guarantees (as defined in Section 1(a)(ix) hereof), the Indentures and the Registration Rights Agreement are hereinafter sometimes referred to collectively as the "Note Documents."

(e) The provisions of this Section shall not affect any agreement between the Ventas Entities with respect to indemnification.
Other Agreements With Respect to Indemnification.
 
SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Ventas Entities on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand from the offering of the Original Notes pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Ventas Entities on the one hand and of the Initial Purchasers on the other
Contribution
 
hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
 
The relative benefits received by the Ventas Entities on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Original Notes pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Original Notes pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Issuers and the total discount received by the Initial Purchasers, in each case as set forth in this Agreement, bear to the aggregate initial offering price of the Original Notes as set forth on such cover.
 
The relative fault of the Ventas Entities, on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Ventas Entities or by the Initial Purchasers and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Ventas Entities and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Original Notes purchased by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. The Initial Purchasers' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 shall be several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls any of the Initial Purchasers within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Initial Purchasers, and each officer and director of any Ventas Entity, and each person, if any, who controls any Ventas Entity within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Ventas Entity.
 
The provisions of this Section shall not affect any agreement among the Ventas Entities with respect to contribution.
 
SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Ventas Entities or any of Ventas' Subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers or controlling person, or by or on behalf of Ventas, and shall survive delivery of the Original Notes to the Initial Purchasers, provided, however that representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Ventas Entities or any of Ventas' Subsidiaries relating to Provident or the Provident Guarantors submitted pursuant hereto shall not survive a Termination Announcement.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery
 
SECTION 9. .
Termination of Agreement
 
(a) The Initial Purchasers may terminate this Agreement, by notice to Ventas, at any time at or prior to Closing Time (i) if there has been, since the time of execution of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Offering Memorandum (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto), any material adverse change in the business, condition, financial or otherwise, results of operations, performance, properties or business prospects of Ventas and the Subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, excluding any adverse change from the failure to or the announcement of an intention to not consummate the Acquisition or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement including any expenses incurred in connection therewith, or (ii) if there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or in the international financial markets, any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis or any change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Initial Purchasers, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Original Notes or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Original Notes, or (iii) if trading in any securities of the Ventas Entities has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or if trading generally on the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange or in the Nasdaq National Market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by any of said exchanges or by such system or by order of the Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or any other governmental authority, or a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States, or (iv) if a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities.
Termination; General.

Liabilities.
 
SECTION 10. .

No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve the Issuers from liability, if any, in respect of such default.
Default by the Issuers
 
SECTION 11. . If any one or more of the several Initial Purchasers shall fail or refuse to purchase Original Notes that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder at the Closing Time, and the aggregate principal amount of Original Notes which such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed or refused to purchase does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Original Notes to be purchased on such date, the other Initial Purchasers shall be obligated, severally, in the proportions that the principal amount of Original Notes set forth opposite their respective names on Schedule A bears to the aggregate principal amount of Original Notes set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Initial Purchasers, or in such other proportions as may be specified by the Initial Purchasers with the consent of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers, to purchase the Original Notes which such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If any one or more of the Initial Purchasers shall fail or refuse to purchase Original Notes and the aggregate principal amount of Original Notes with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Original Notes to be purchased at the Closing Time, and arrangements satisfactory to the Initial Purchasers and the Issuers for the purchase of such Original Notes are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party (other than defaulting Initial Purchasers) except that the provisions of Section 3, Section 4, Section 6 and Section 7 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case, either the Initial Purchasers or the Issuers shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time, as the case may be, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Offering Memorandum or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
Default of One or More of the Several Initial Purchasers
 
As used in this Agreement, the term "Initial Purchaser" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Initial Purchaser under this Section 11. Any action taken under this Section 11 shall not relieve any defaulting Initial Purchaser from liability in respect of any default of such Initial Purchaser under this Agreement.

Actual future results and trends for the Company may differ materially depending on a variety of factors discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"). Factors that may affect the plans or results of the Company include, without limitation, (a) the ability and willingness of Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "Kindred") and certain of its affiliates to continue to meet and/or perform their obligations under their contractual arrangements with the Company and the Company's subsidiaries, including without limitation the lease agreements and various agreements entered into by the Company and Kindred at the time of our spin off of Kindred on May 1, 1998 (the "1998 Spin Off"), as such agreements may have been amended and restated in connection with Kindred's emergence from bankruptcy on April 20, 2001, (b) the ability and willingness of Kindred to continue to meet and/or perform its obligation to indemnify and defend the Company for all litigation and other claims relating to the healthcare operations and other assets and liabilities transferred to Kindred in the 1998 Spin Off, (c) the ability of Kindred and the Company's other operators, tenants and borrowers to maintain the financial strength and liquidity necessary to satisfy their respective obligations and duties under the leases and other agreements with the Company, and their existing credit agreements, (d) the Company's success in implementing its business strategy and the Company's ability to identify, underwrite, finance, consummate and integrate diversifying acquisitions or investments, (e) the nature and extent of future competition, (f) the extent of future healthcare reform and regulation, including cost containment measures and changes in reimbursement policies, procedures and rates, (g) increases in the cost of borrowing for the Company, (h) the ability of the Company's operators to deliver high quality care and to attract patients, (i) the results of litigation affecting the Company, (j) changes in general economic conditions and/or economic conditions in the markets in which the Company may, from time to time, compete, (k) the ability of the Company to pay down, refinance, restructure, and/or extend its indebtedness as it becomes due, (l) the movement of interest rates and the resulting impact on the value of and the accounting for the Company's interest rate swap agreement, (m) the ability and willingness of the Company to maintain its qualification as a REIT due to economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations, (n) final determination of the Company's taxable net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 and for the year ending December 31, 2005, (o) the ability and willingness of the Company's tenants to renew their leases with the Company upon expiration of the leases and the Company's ability to relet its properties on the same or better terms in the event such leases expire and are not renewed by the existing tenants, (p) risks associated with the Company's proposed acquisition of Provident Senior Living Trust ("Provident"), including its ability to successfully complete the merger on the contemplated terms and to timely and fully realize expected revenues and cost savings therefrom; (q) the impact on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of Kindred and the Company's other operators resulting from increased operating costs and uninsured liabilities for professional liability claims, and the ability of Kindred and the Company's other operators to accurately estimate the magnitude of such liabilities; and (r) the value of the Company's rental reset right with Kindred, which is dependent on a variety of factors and is highly speculative. Many of such factors are beyond the control of the Company and its management.
