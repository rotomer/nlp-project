On July 27, 2005, Ventas, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2005.
 
A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated in this Item 2.02 by reference.
 
The press release states that the Company's normalized funds from operations ("FFO") for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 were $45.8 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, as compared to $37.7 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. The Company's net income for the second quarter of 2005 was $27.1 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, as compared to $25.7 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, after discontinued operations of $0.2 million, for the comparable period in 2004.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2005, the Company's normalized FFO was $86.6 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, as compared to $71.7 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2004. For the first six months of 2005, the Company's net income was $54.6 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, as compared to $48.9 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, after discontinued operations of $0.4 million, for the comparable period in 2004.
 
The press release also states that, with the completion of the Company's acquisition of Provident Senior Living Trust ("Provident") and assuming that the Company closes $142 million of acquisitions it currently has under contract in the third quarter of 2005, the Company expects its normalized FFO for the year ending December 31, 2005 to be between $2.06 and $2.08 per diluted share, updated from its previous guidance of $1.94 to $1.96 per diluted share, and its normalized FFO for the year ending December 31, 2006 to be between $2.20 and $2.23 per diluted share. The Company expects its net income for 2005 to be between $1.19 and $1.21 per diluted share and its net income for 2006 to be between $1.11 and $1.14 per diluted share.

 Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") said today that second quarter 2005 normalized Funds from Operations ("FFO") rose 22 percent to $45.8 million, compared with $37.7 million in the second quarter of 2004. Normalized FFO per diluted share in the second quarter of 2005 increased 13 percent to $0.51 from $0.45 per diluted share for the comparable 2004 period. In the quarter ended June 30, 2005, the Company had 89.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, compared to 84.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding a year earlier.
LOUISVILLE, KY (July 27, 2005)
 
Normalized FFO for the six months ended June 30, 2005 was $86.6 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, a 21 percent increase from $71.7 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, for the comparable 2004 period.
 
Normalized FFO for all periods excludes a $0.4 million expense relating to fees in connection with a bridge loan commitment obtained by the Company prior to the closing of the acquisition of Provident Senior Living Trust ("Provident"), which was not used by the Company. Results for the second quarter and first six months of 2005 benefited from increased rent resulting from the Company's accelerated investment activity and increased rent from the escalator clauses contained in its existing leases.
 
"Our efforts over the past years have been focused on building a more reliable enterprise, assembling a diverse, high-quality seniors housing and healthcare portfolio, and creating a platform for sustained excellence. The successful completion of the Provident acquisition and the addition of other private-pay assets to our portfolio has helped us to accomplish these goals," Ventas Chairman, President and CEO Debra A. Cafaro said. "With an enterprise value of $5 billion and a compound annual total return of 72.5 percent for the five-year period ended June 30, 2005, we continue to deliver growth and superior performance to our shareholders," she added.
 
GAAP NET INCOME
 
Net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 was $27.1 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, compared with net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 of $25.7 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, after discontinued operations of $0.2 million.

VENTAS RAISES 2005 GUIDANCE AND ISSUES 2006 GUIDANCE
 
With the completion of the Provident acquisition, and assuming that the Company closes $142 million of acquisitions it currently has under contract in the third quarter, Ventas expects 2005 normalized FFO to be between $2.06 and $2.08 per diluted share, increased from the previous guidance of $1.94 to $1.96 per diluted share.
 
The Company also said that, if these acquisitions close as expected, it should achieve 2006 normalized FFO of between $2.20 and $2.23 per diluted share.
 
The Company expects non-cash straight-line rent attributable to the leases acquired in the Provident acquisition to approximate $11.0 million in 2005 and $17.1 million in 2006.
 
The Company's normalized FFO guidance for all periods assumes that all of the Company's tenants and borrowers continue to meet all of their obligations to the Company. In addition, the Company's normalized FFO guidance (and related GAAP earnings projections) excludes gains and losses on the sales of assets and the impact of future, unannounced acquisitions, divestitures (including pursuant to tenant options to purchase) and capital transactions. Its guidance also excludes the future impact of (a) any rent or other amounts derived from the Reset Right, whether through a negotiated resolution with Kindred or the appraisal process set forth in the Kindred Master Leases, (b) any expense the Company records for non-cash "swap ineffectiveness," and (c) any expenses related to asset impairment, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses or premiums incurred as a result of early debt retirement.
 
The Company's guidance is based on a number of other assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.
 
Reconciliation of the Company's guidance to the Company's projected GAAP earnings is provided on a schedule attached to this press release. The Company may from time to time update its publicly announced guidance, but it is not obligated to do so.

Funds from Operations
 
FFO and normalized FFO for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 (in thousands, except per share amounts):
 
 
Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT. The Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.
 
FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) or as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.

Net Debt to Pro Forma EBITDA
 
The following pro forma information considers the effect on net income, interest and depreciation of the Company's investments and other capital transactions that were completed during the three months ended June 30, 2005, as if the transactions had been consummated as of the beginning of the period. The following table illustrates net debt to pro forma earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") for the three months ended June 30, 2005 (dollars in thousands):
 
 
The Company considers EBITDA a profitability measure which indicates the Company's ability to service debt. The Company considers the net debt to EBITDA ratio a useful measure to evaluate the Company's ability to pay its indebtedness. EBITDA presented herein is not necessarily comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) or as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is EBITDA necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
