On October 27, 2005, Ventas, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2005.
 
A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated in this Item 2.02 by reference.
 
The press release states that the Company's normalized funds from operations ("FFO") for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 were $56.3 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, as compared to $39.8 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2004. The Company's net income for the third quarter of 2005 was $28.7 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, as compared to $25.3 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, after discontinued operations of $0.2 million, for the comparable period in 2004.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, the Company's normalized FFO was $142.9 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, as compared to $111.6 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2004. For the first nine months of 2005, the Company's net income was $83.4 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, as compared to $74.2 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, after discontinued operations of $0.6 million, for the comparable period in 2004.
 
The press release also states that the Company still expects its normalized FFO for the year ending December 31, 2005 to be between $2.06 and $2.08 per diluted share and its normalized FFO for the year ending December 31, 2006 to be between $2.20 and $2.23 per diluted share. The Company expects its net income for 2005 to be between $1.19 and $1.21 per diluted share and its net income for 2006 to be between $1.11 and $1.14 per diluted share.
 
 
This Current Report on Form 8-K includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The Company's actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange

(together with its subsidiaries, "Kindred"), Brookdale Living Communities, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "Brookdale") and Alterra Healthcare Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, "Alterra") to meet and/or perform their obligations to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities under the Company's respective contractual arrangements with Kindred, Brookdale and Alterra; (c) the ability of the Company's operators, tenants and borrowers to maintain the financial strength and liquidity necessary to satisfy their respective obligations and liabilities, including without limitation their existing credit facilities; (d) the Company's success in implementing its business strategy and the Company's ability to identify, underwrite, finance, consummate and integrate diversifying acquisitions or investments; (e) the nature and extent of future competition; (f) the extent of future healthcare reform and regulation, including cost containment measures and changes in reimbursement policies, procedures and rates; (g) increases in the cost of borrowing for the Company; (h) the ability of the Company's operators to deliver high quality care and to attract patients; (i) the results of litigation affecting the Company; (j) changes in general economic conditions and/or economic conditions in the markets in which the Company may, from time to time, compete; (k) the ability of the Company to pay down, refinance, restructure, and/or extend its indebtedness as it becomes due; (l) the movement of interest rates and the resulting impact on the value of and the accounting for the Company's interest rate swap agreement; (m) the ability and willingness of the Company to maintain its qualification as a REIT due to economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations; (n) final determination of the Company's taxable net income for the year ending December 31, 2005; (o) the ability and willingness of the Company's tenants to renew their leases with the Company upon expiration of the leases and the Company's ability to relet its properties on the same or better terms in the event such leases expire and are not renewed by the existing tenants; (p) risks associated with the Company's acquisition of Provident Senior Living Trust, including its ability to timely and fully realize expected revenues and cost savings from the merger; (q) the impact on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of the Company's operators resulting from increased operating costs and uninsured liabilities for professional liability claims, and the ability of the Company's operators to accurately estimate the magnitude of such liabilities; and (r) the value of the Company's rental reset right with Kindred, which is dependent on a variety of factors and is highly speculative. Many of such factors are beyond the control of the Company and its management.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
 
On October 24, 2005, the Company and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP ("S&C") reached a settlement (the "S&C Settlement") of the previously disclosed legal malpractice litigation brought by the Company against S&C in 2002.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") said today that third quarter 2005 normalized Funds from Operations ("FFO") rose 41.5 percent to $56.3 million, compared with $39.8 million in the third quarter of 2004. Normalized FFO per diluted share in the third quarter of 2005 increased 14.9 percent to $0.54 from $0.47 per diluted share for the comparable 2004 period. In the quarter ended September 30, 2005, the Company had 103.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, compared to 84.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding a year earlier.
LOUISVILLE, KY (October 27, 2005)
 
Normalized FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was $142.9 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, a 28.1 percent increase from $111.6 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, for the comparable 2004 period.
 
Normalized FFO for the nine-month period excludes a $0.4 million expense relating to fees in connection with a bridge loan commitment obtained by the Company prior to the closing of the acquisition of Provident Senior Living Trust ("Provident"), which was not used by the Company. Results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2005 benefited from increased rent resulting from the Company's accelerated investment activity and increased rent from the escalator clauses contained in its existing leases.
 
"In the third quarter we continued to successfully execute on our business strategy to deliver reliable growing cash flows and exceptional performance to our shareholders," Ventas President, Chairman and CEO Debra A. Cafaro said. "With more than $1.5 billion in acquisitions completed in 2005, we have a high quality portfolio of seniors housing and healthcare assets and a platform for sustained excellence," she added.
 
GAAP NET INCOME
 
Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 was $28.7 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared with net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 of $25.3 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, after discontinued operations of $0.2 million.
 
Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was $83.4 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, compared with net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 of $74.2 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, after discontinued operations of $0.6 million.

SETTLEMENT OF LITIGATION AGAINST SULLIVAN & CROMWELL; VENTAS TO ESTABLISH CHARITABLE FOUNDATION
 
Ventas and Sullivan & Cromwell ("S&C") have reached a settlement (the "S&C Settlement") of the previously disclosed legal malpractice litigation brought by Ventas against S&C in 2002. Under the terms of the S&C Settlement, a $25.5 million payment will be made to Ventas on behalf of S&C in the fourth quarter of 2005. After expenses to be paid by Ventas in connection with the litigation, including to the Company's outside legal counsel, Myron Cherry & Associates, Chicago, Illinois, Ventas should receive approximately $16 million in net proceeds from the S&C Settlement.
 
With $2 million of these net proceeds of settlement, Ventas intends to establish and fund the Ventas Charitable Foundation. The Ventas Charitable Foundation will be used to support charitable and philanthropic causes important to the communities in which the Company operates and to the Company's employees. The balance of the net proceeds will be used to repay debt and for other corporate purposes.
 
As a result of these developments, the Company expects its 2005 net income and FFO to increase by approximately $14 million. The amount to be paid on behalf of S&C to Ventas in the S&C Settlement, expenses related thereto, and the contribution to the Ventas Charitable Foundation will be excluded in the Company's normalized FFO results for all periods.

Its guidance also excludes the future impact of (a) any rent or other amounts derived from the Reset Right, whether through a negotiated resolution with Kindred or the appraisal process set forth in the Kindred Master Leases, (b) any expense the Company records for non-cash "swap ineffectiveness," (c) the S&C Settlement and related expenses that were unaccrued on or before September 30, 2005, as well as the expense of establishing and funding the Ventas Charitable Foundation and (d) any expenses related to asset impairment, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses or premiums incurred as a result of early debt retirement.

If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.
 
Reconciliation of the Company's guidance to the Company's projected GAAP earnings is provided on a schedule attached to this press release. The Company may from time to time update its publicly announced guidance, but it is not obligated to do so.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT. The Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.
 
FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) or as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.

Net Debt to Pro Forma EBITDA
 
The following pro forma information considers the effect on net income, interest and depreciation of the Company's investments and other capital transactions that were completed during the three months ended September 30, 2005, as if the transactions had been consummated as of the beginning of the period. The following table illustrates net debt to pro forma earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") for the three months ended September 30, 2005 (dollars in thousands):
 
 
The Company considers EBITDA a profitability measure which indicates the Company's ability to service debt. The Company considers the net debt to EBITDA ratio a useful measure to evaluate the Company's ability to pay its indebtedness. EBITDA presented herein is not necessarily comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) or as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is EBITDA necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.

Kindred Coverage Ratios
 
The following is based on data provided by Kindred to the Company or obtained from Kindred's public filings. This information reflects Kindred's EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverage by Master Lease:
 
 
1
Trailing Twelve Months EBITDARM and EBITDAR for the period ended June 30, 2005 (the latest available data provided by Kindred) to the Company's Trailing Twelve Months cash rental revenue.
 
2
Coverage reflects the ratio of Kindred's EBITDARM to rent. EBITDARM is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees. In the calculation of Trailing Twelve Months EBITDARM, intercompany profit pertaining to services provided by Kindred's PeopleFirst Rehabilitation and Pharmacy Divisions for the twelve months ended June 30, 2005 has been eliminated from purchased ancillary expenses within the Ventas portfolio.
 
3
Coverage reflects the ratio of Kindred's EBITDAR to rent. EBITDAR is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent but after deducting a five percent management fee. In the calculation of Trailing Twelve Months EBITDAR, intercompany profit pertaining to Kindred's PeopleFirst Rehabilitation and Pharmacy Divisions for the twelve months ended June 30, 2005 has been eliminated from purchased ancillary expenses within the Ventas portfolio.
