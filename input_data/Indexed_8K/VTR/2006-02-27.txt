On February 27, 2006, Ventas, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005.
A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated in this Item 2.02 by reference.
The press release states that the Company's normalized funds from operations ("FFO") for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005 were $57.2 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, as compared to $40.1 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2004. The Company's net income for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $47.2 million, or $0.45 per diluted share (after discontinued operations of $5.4 million), as compared to $46.7 million, or $0.55 per diluted share (after discontinued operations of $20.2 million), for the comparable period in 2004.
For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company's normalized FFO was $200.1 million, or $2.09 per diluted share, as compared to $151.7 million, or $1.80 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2004. For 2005, the Company's net income was $130.6 million, or $1.36 per diluted share (after discontinued operations of $5.3 million), as compared to $120.9 million, or $1.43 per diluted share (after discontinued operations of $20.7 million), for 2004.
The press release also states that the Company expects its normalized FFO for the year ending December 31, 2006 to be between $2.20 and $2.23 per diluted share. The Company expects its net income for 2006 to be between $1.11 and $1.14 per diluted share.
This Current Report on Form 8-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Such forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and security holders must recognize that actual results may differ from the Company's expectations. The Company does not undertake a duty to update such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made.
The Company's actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

parties to meet and/or perform the obligations under their various contractual arrangements with the Company; (b) the ability and willingness of Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "Kindred"), Brookdale Living Communities, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "Brookdale") and Alterra Healthcare Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, "Alterra") to meet and/or perform their obligations to indemnify, defend and hold the Company harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities under the Company's respective contractual arrangements with Kindred, Brookdale and Alterra; (c) the ability of the Company's operators, tenants and borrowers to maintain the financial strength and liquidity necessary to satisfy their respective obligations and liabilities to third parties, including without limitation obligations under their existing credit facilities; (d) the Company's success in implementing its business strategy and its ability to identify, underwrite, consummate, finance and integrate diversifying acquisitions or investments, including those in different asset types and outside the United States; (e) the nature and extent of future competition; (f) the extent of future or pending healthcare reform and regulation, including cost containment measures and changes in reimbursement policies, procedures and rates; (g) increases in the Company's cost of borrowing; (h) the ability of the Company's operators to deliver high quality care and to attract patients; (i) the results of litigation affecting the Company; (j) changes in general economic conditions and/or economic conditions in the markets in which the Company may, from time to time, compete; (k) the Company's ability to pay down, refinance, restructure and/or extend its indebtedness as it becomes due; (l) the movement of interest rates and the resulting impact on the value of and the accounting for the Company's interest rate swap agreement; (m) the Company's ability and willingness to maintain its qualification as a REIT due to economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations; (n) final determination of the Company's taxable net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 and for the year ending December 31, 2006; (o) the ability and willingness of the Company's tenants to renew their leases with the Company upon expiration of the leases and the Company's ability to relet its properties on the same or better terms in the event such leases expire and are not renewed by the existing tenants; (p) the impact on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of the Company's operators, tenants and borrowers resulting from increased operating costs and uninsured liabilities for professional liability claims, and the ability of the Company's operators, tenants and borrowers to accurately estimate the magnitude of such liabilities; and (q) the value of the Company's reset right with Kindred, which is dependent on a variety of factors and is highly speculative. Many of these factors are beyond the Company's control and the control of its management.

LOUISVILLE, KY (February 27, 2006)  Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") said today that fourth quarter 2005 normalized Funds from Operations ("FFO") rose 42 percent to $57.2 million, compared with $40.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Normalized FFO per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2005 increased 17 percent to $0.55 from $0.47 per diluted share for the comparable 2004 period. In the quarter ended December 31, 2005, the Company had 104.2 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, compared to 85.2 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding a year earlier.
Normalized FFO for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $200.1 million, a 32 percent increase from $151.7 million for the comparable 2004 period. Normalized FFO per diluted share grew 16 percent year-over-year to $2.09 in 2005 from $1.80 in 2004.
Normalized FFO for 2005 excludes net proceeds received by Ventas from a previously announced litigation settlement with Sullivan & Cromwell of $15.9 million, a contribution to the Ventas Charitable Foundation of $2.0 million, a net gain on swap breakage of $1.0 million, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees of $1.4 million in connection with the payoff of the CMBS loan and $0.4 million in fees for a bridge loan commitment obtained by the Company for the acquisition of Provident Senior Living Trust ("Provident"). Normalized FFO for 2004 excludes the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees of $1.4 million in connection with the refinancing of the Company's revolving credit facility.
Results for the fourth quarter and full year benefited from increased rent resulting from the Company's accelerated investment activity and increased rent from the escalator clauses contained in its existing leases.
Ventas also said that its Board of Directors voted to increase the Company's first quarter 2006 dividend to $0.395 per share, an increase of 10 percent from the quarterly 2005 dividend of $0.36. The Ventas first quarter dividend is payable March 30, 2006 to stockholders of record on March 7, 2006.

"Ventas had another exceptional year in 2005, delivering Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of 23 percent and completing the transformational acquisition of Provident Senior Living Trust," Ventas President, Chairman and CEO Debra A. Cafaro said. "Over the last few years, we have doubled the size of our Company and diversified our portfolio to include a significant number of high-quality, private-pay independent and assisted living facilities, which now account for about 44 percent of our aggregate annual rental income. Our focused acquisition strategy, balance sheet management and investment in processes and people have created a strong, high performing enterprise that is well positioned to capitalize on opportunities as we move into 2006," she added.
"For the last four years, we have delivered double digit normalized FFO per share growth, and we are once again pleased to share our success with our shareholders by increasing our quarterly dividend by 10 percent. This action by our Board of Directors shows Ventas's ability to increase its dividend by above average rates due to its stable, growing cash flows and excellent portfolio of assets." Cafaro said.
UPDATE ON RESET RIGHT TO INCREASE BASE RENTS UNDER MASTER LEASES WITH KINDRED
Ventas recently announced that it was reviewing the release by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS") on January 19, 2006 regarding CMS's proposed 2007 fiscal year payment rule for long-term acute care hospitals ("LTACs"). Among other things, the proposed rule freezes Medicare payment rates for LTACs for fiscal year 2007 and contains a number of proposed changes to current LTAC payment policy that could result in an 11 percent Medicare rate cut to LTACs.
Ventas has an eighteen-month time period, until July 19, 2007, to deliver its notices (the "Reset Notices") to Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: KND) ("Kindred") that would initiate Ventas's option (the "Reset Right") contained in its Master Leases with Kindred (the "Master Leases") to potentially increase annual base rents under the Master Leases to "Fair Market Rental" levels. Ventas has not yet given the Reset Notices because it is analyzing the potential impact, if any, of the proposed rule on Kindred and on Ventas's portfolio of 39 Kindred-operated LTACs. Ventas is also assessing the likelihood that CMS's proposed rule for LTAC reimbursement will be adopted in its current form or will be modified as a result of industry comment and review. The final version of the rule is likely to be made public by CMS in the second quarter of 2006.
"We believe that the Reset Right should deliver significant value for Ventas shareholders, based upon our preliminary review and analysis of the CMS rule and the performance of our Kindred portfolio of skilled nursing facilities and LTACs," Cafaro said. "We will continue our review of the facts and the CMS proposal, and look forward to providing updated guidance to our shareholders that will reflect that review."
The Reset Right is contained in each of the original four Master Leases Ventas entered into with Kindred in April 2001 when Kindred successfully emerged from its Chapter 11 reorganization. Under the Reset Right, Ventas has a one-time right under each Master Lease to increase the base annual rent to a then fair market rental rate. If the Reset Notices are given by Ventas at any time before July 19, 2006, the rental increase, if any, would be effective on July 19, 2006 even if the appraisal process continued beyond that date. If Ventas gives the Reset Notices after July 19, 2006, the rental increase, if any, would be effective on the date the Reset Notices are given. If Ventas exercises the Reset Right under all of the Master Leases, Ventas will pay a one-time reset fee of up to $4.6 million. If Ventas exercises the Reset Right under fewer than all of the Master Leases, the reset fee will be prorated. If the Reset Right is exercised, the annual rent escalations under the applicable Master Leases may be altered, depending on market conditions at the time. The value of the Reset Right is dependent on a variety of factors and market conditions and is highly speculative, and there can be no assurance regarding the value of the Reset Right.

"Our aggregate annual base rent can only increase and never decrease under the Reset Right process, giving us maximum flexibility," Cafaro said. "As in prior situations where unexpected events have altered the landscape, we intend to work creatively and tenaciously to seek a positive outcome for our shareholders."
GAAP NET INCOME
Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 was $47.2 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared with net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 of $46.7 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, after income from discontinued operations of $5.4 million and $20.2 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $130.6 million, or $1.36 per diluted share, compared with net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 of $120.9 million, or $1.43 per diluted share, after income from discontinued operations of $5.3 million and $20.7 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively.

FOURTH QUARTER 2005 RESULTS
Rental revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 was $96.3 million, of which $50.3 million resulted from leases with Kindred. Fourth quarter 2005 expenses totaled $56.5 million and included $28.7 million of depreciation expense and $33.6 million of interest expense, offset by Ventas's receipt of net proceeds from litigation settlement of $15.9 million. General, administrative and professional fees totaled $8.4 million, including a $2.0 million contribution to the Ventas Charitable Foundation. Property-level operating expenses relating to the Company's medical office building portfolio for the period were $0.7 million.
FULL YEAR 2005 RESULTS
Rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $324.7 million, of which $199.1 million resulted from leases with Kindred. Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $207.6 million and included $87.8 million of depreciation expense and $105.6 million of interest expense, offset by Ventas's receipt of net proceeds from litigation settlement of $15.9 million. General, administrative and professional fees totaled $25.1 million, including a $2.0 million contribution to the Ventas Charitable Foundation. Property-level operating expenses relating to the Company's medical office building portfolio for the period were $2.6 million.
VENTAS AFFIRMS NORMALIZED FFO GUIDANCE FOR 2006
Ventas affirmed its 2006 normalized FFO guidance of between $2.20 and $2.23 per diluted share. If achieved, this "steady state" projection represents 6 to 7 percent core growth in normalized FFO per share.
The Company expects non-cash straight-line rent attributable to its 2005 acquisition of Provident to approximate $17.1 million in 2006.
The Company's normalized FFO guidance for all periods assumes that all of the Company's tenants and borrowers continue to meet all of their obligations to the Company. In addition, the Company's normalized FFO guidance (and related GAAP earnings projections) excludes gains and losses on the sales of assets and the impact of future, unannounced acquisitions, divestitures (including pursuant to tenant options to purchase) and capital transactions. Its guidance also excludes the future impact of (a) any rent or other amounts derived from the Reset Right, whether through a negotiated resolution with Kindred or the appraisal process set forth in the Master Leases, (b)

any expense the Company records for non-cash "swap ineffectiveness" and (c) any expenses related to asset impairment, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses or premiums incurred as a result of early debt retirement.
The Company's guidance is based on a number of other assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.
Reconciliation of the Company's guidance to the Company's projected GAAP earnings is provided on a schedule attached to this press release. The Company may from time to time update its publicly announced guidance, but it is not obligated to do so.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT. The Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.
FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) or as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.

Net Debt to Pro Forma EBITDA
The following pro forma information considers the effect on net income, interest and depreciation of the Company's investments and other capital transactions that were completed during the three months ended December 31, 2005, as if the transactions had been consummated as of the beginning of the period. The following table illustrates net debt to pro forma earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") (dollars in thousands):
 
The Company considers EBITDA a profitability measure which indicates the Company's ability to service debt. The Company considers the net debt to EBITDA ratio a useful measure to evaluate the Company's ability to pay its indebtedness. EBITDA presented herein is not necessarily comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) or as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is EBITDA necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
