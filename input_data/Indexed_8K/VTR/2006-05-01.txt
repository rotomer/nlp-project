Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On April 26, 2006, Ventas, Inc. (the "Company"), together with certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, and Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Ventas Realty"), as borrower, entered into a Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender, and the lenders referred to therein. The Credit Agreement provides for a $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaces the $300 million senior secured revolving credit facility provided under the Third Amended and Restated Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement dated as of September 8, 2004 (the "Prior Credit Agreement") among Ventas Realty, as borrower, the Company, as guarantor, and the lenders identified therein, including Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank. Ventas Realty may increase its borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth therein, up to $600 million.
Borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to an applicable percentage over (i) in the case of Eurodollar rate loans, a one-, two-, three- or six-month Eurodollar rate, at Ventas Realty's option, or (ii) in the case of base rate loans, the higher of (x) the federal funds rate in effect for the relevant period plus 0.50% and (y) the annual rate of interest announced by Bank of America, N.A. as its "prime rate." The applicable percentage is determined by reference to the Company's consolidated total leverage ratio and ranges from 0.50% to 1.25% for Eurodollar rate loans and equals 0.00% for base rate loans. If Ventas Realty achieves an investment grade debt rating by either Standard & Poor's Ratings Services or Moody's Investors Service, then Ventas Realty may elect to convert to a ratings-based pricing grid.
As of April 26, 2006, Ventas Realty had $132 million of outstanding borrowings and $225,000 of outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Agreement.
Ventas Realty's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its other subsidiaries identified therein.
The Credit Agreement matures on April 26, 2009 but may be extended, at Ventas Realty's option, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, for an additional period of one year. Loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement may be repaid from time to time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs, if any, with respect to Eurodollar rate loans.
The Credit Agreement imposes various restrictions on Ventas Realty, the Company and the other guarantors, including restrictions pertaining to: (i) liens; (ii) investments; (iii) the incurrence of additional indebtedness; (iv) mergers, sales of assets and dissolutions; (v) certain dividend, distribution and other payments; (vi) permitted businesses; (vii) transactions with affiliates; (viii) agreements limiting certain guarantees or liens; and (ix) the maintenance of certain consolidated total leverage, secured debt leverage and unsecured leverage ratios, consolidated fixed charge and unencumbered interest coverage ratios and minimum consolidated adjusted net worth.
The Credit Agreement contains usual and customary events of default. If a default occurs and is continuing, Ventas Realty may be required to repay all amounts outstanding thereunder.
The foregoing description is qualified by reference in its entirety to the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated in this Item 1.01 by reference.
Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On May 1, 2006, the Company issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2006.
A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated in this Item 2.02 by reference.
The press release states that the Company's normalized funds from operations ("FFO") for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 were $57.5 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, as compared to $40.7 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2005. The Company's net income for the first quarter of 2006 was $29.1 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, as compared to $27.6 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the comparable period in 2005.
The press release also states that the Company expects its normalized FFO for the year ending December 31, 2006 to be between $2.23 and $2.25 per diluted share, updated from its previous guidance of $2.20 to $2.23 per diluted share. The Company expects its net income for 2006 to be between $1.14 and $1.16 per diluted share.
This Current Report on Form 8-K includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements regarding the Company's and its subsidiaries' expected future financial position, results of operations, cash flows, funds from operations, dividends and dividend plans, financing plans, business strategy, budgets, projected costs, capital expenditures, competitive positions, growth opportunities, expected lease income, continued qualification as a real estate investment trust ("REIT"), plans and objectives of management for future operations and statements that include words such as "anticipate," "if," "believe," "plan," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "could," "should," "will" and other similar expressions are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and security holders must recognize that actual results may differ from the Company's expectations. The Company does not undertake a duty to update such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they were made.
The Company's actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Factors that may affect the Company's plans or results include without limitation: (a) the ability and willingness of the Company's operators, tenants, borrowers and other third parties to meet
and/or perform the obligations under their various contractual arrangements with the Company; (b) the ability and willingness of Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "Kindred"), Brookdale Living Communities, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "Brookdale") and Alterra Healthcare Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, "Alterra") to meet and/or perform their obligations to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities under the Company's respective contractual arrangements with Kindred, Brookdale and Alterra; (c) the ability of the Company's operators, tenants and borrowers to maintain the financial strength and liquidity necessary to satisfy their respective obligations and liabilities, including without limitation their existing credit facilities; (d) the Company's success in implementing its business strategy and the Company's ability to identify, underwrite, finance, consummate and integrate diversifying acquisitions or investments, including those in different asset types and outside the United States; (e) the nature and extent of future competition; (f) the extent of future or pending healthcare reform and regulation, including cost containment measures and changes in reimbursement policies, procedures and rates; (g) increases in the Company's cost of borrowing; (h) the ability of the Company's operators to deliver high quality care and to attract patients; (i) the results of litigation affecting the Company; (j) changes in general economic conditions and/or economic conditions in the markets in which the Company may, from time to time, compete; (k) the Company's ability to pay down, refinance, restructure, and/or extend its indebtedness as it becomes due; (l) the movement of interest rates and the resulting impact on the value of and the accounting for the Company's interest rate swap agreement; (m) the Company's ability and willingness to maintain its qualification as a REIT due to economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations; (n) final determination of the Company's taxable net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 and for the year ending December 31, 2006; (o) the ability and willingness of the Company's tenants to renew their leases with the Company upon expiration of the leases and the Company's ability to relet its properties on the same or better terms in the event such leases expire and are not renewed by the existing tenants; (p) the impact on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of the Company's operators, tenants and borrowers resulting from increased operating costs and uninsured liabilities for professional liability claims, and the ability of the Company's operators, tenants and borrowers to accurately estimate the magnitude of such liabilities; and (q) the value of the Company's rental reset right with Kindred, which is dependent on a variety of factors and is highly speculative. Many of such factors are beyond the control of the Company and its management.

Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans.

Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") said today that first quarter 2006 normalized Funds from Operations ("FFO") rose 41 percent to $57.5 million, compared with $40.7 million in the first quarter of 2005. Normalized FFO per diluted share in the first quarter of 2006 increased 15 percent to $0.55 from $0.48 per diluted share for the comparable 2005 period. In the quarter ended March 31, 2006, the Company had 104.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, compared to 85.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding a year earlier.
LOUISVILLE, KY (May 1, 2006)
Results for the first quarter benefited from increased rent resulting from the Company's accelerated investment activity in 2005 and increased rent from the escalator clauses contained in its existing leases.
"With a 15 percent increase in normalized FFO for the first quarter and continued execution of our strategic growth and development plan, we feel 2006 is off to an excellent start," Ventas President, Chairman and CEO Debra A. Cafaro said. "We remain focused on our goal of delivering reliable cash flow and superior risk-adjusted returns. As we look ahead to the remainder of the year, we are pleased to increase our guidance for 2006 normalized FFO per share to the higher end of the range of $2.23 to $2.25 per share."
GAAP NET INCOME
Net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 was $29.1 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared with net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 of $27.6 million, or $0.32 per diluted share.

FIRST QUARTER 2006 RESULTS
Rental revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 was $96.5 million, of which $50.3 million resulted from leases with Kindred. First quarter 2006 expenses totaled $68.7 million and included $28.5 million of depreciation expense and $33.0 million of interest expense. General, administrative and professional fees totaled $6.7 million and included $0.8 million for non-cash stock-based compensation. Property-level operating expenses relating to the Company's medical office building portfolio for the period were $0.6 million.
VENTAS RAISES NORMALIZED FFO GUIDANCE FOR 2006
Ventas also stated that it expects its 2006 normalized FFO to be between $2.23 and $2.25 per diluted share, increased from its previous guidance of $2.20 to $2.23 per diluted share. If achieved, this projection represents approximately 7 percent growth in normalized FFO per share.
The Company's normalized FFO guidance for all periods assumes that all of the Company's tenants and borrowers continue to meet all of their obligations to the Company. In addition, the Company's normalized FFO

guidance (and related GAAP earnings projections) excludes gains and losses on the sales of assets and the impact of future, unannounced acquisitions, divestitures (including pursuant to tenant options to purchase) and capital transactions. Its guidance also excludes the future impact of (a) any rent or other amounts derived from the Reset Right, whether through a negotiated resolution with Kindred or the appraisal process set forth in the Master Leases, (b) any expense the Company records for non-cash "swap ineffectiveness" and (c) any expenses related to asset impairment, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, including in connection with the replacement of the Company's previous secured revolving credit facility with the new $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility, or additional costs, expenses or premiums incurred as a result of early debt retirement.
The Company's guidance is based on a number of other assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.
Reconciliation of the Company's guidance to the Company's projected GAAP earnings is provided on a schedule attached to this press release. The Company may from time to time update its publicly announced guidance, but it is not obligated to do so.

Many of such factors are beyond the control of the Company and its management.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT. The Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.
FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs.

The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.

The Company considers EBITDA a profitability measure which indicates the Company's ability to service debt. The Company considers the net debt to EBITDA ratio a useful measure to evaluate the Company's ability to pay its indebtedness. EBITDA presented herein is not necessarily comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is EBITDA necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
