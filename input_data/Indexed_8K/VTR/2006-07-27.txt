Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") said today that second quarter 2006 normalized Funds from Operations ("FFO") rose 30 percent to $59.5 million, compared with $45.8 million in the second quarter of 2005. Normalized FFO per diluted share in the second quarter of 2006 increased 12 percent to $0.57 from $0.51 per diluted share for the comparable 2005 period. In the quarter ended June 30, 2006, the Company had 104.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, compared to 89.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding a year earlier.
LOUISVILLE, KY (July 27, 2006)
Normalized FFO for the six months ended June 30, 2006 was $117.0 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, a 35 percent increase from $86.6 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, for the comparable 2005 period.
Normalized FFO for all periods excludes a $1.3 million expense relating to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees in connection with the Company's successful refinancing of its previous secured revolving credit facility with a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility during the second quarter of 2006. Results for the second quarter and first six months of 2006 benefited from increased rent resulting from the Company's successful implementation of its acquisition program and leading internal growth rate from its existing leases.
"Several important recent developments underscore our dedication to disciplined financial management, our focus on delivering reliable cash flows and superior risk-adjusted returns, and our commitment to operate with transparency and integrity," Ventas Chairman, President and CEO Debra A. Cafaro said. "We were gratified to recently receive our first investment grade rating from Fitch Ratings. Additionally, we kept the Reset Right process with Kindred moving forward. And finally, we remain one of the top performing REITs with our eleven consecutive quarters of double digit normalized FFO per share growth and continued execution of our strategic diversification plan. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we are pleased to increase our guidance for 2006 normalized FFO per share to $2.25 to $2.27 per share."

VENTAS RAISES NORMALIZED FFO GUIDANCE FOR 2006
Ventas also stated that it expects its 2006 normalized FFO to be between $2.25 and $2.27 per diluted share, increased from its previous guidance of $2.23 to $2.25 per diluted share. If achieved, this projection represents 8 to 9 percent growth in normalized FFO per share over 2005.
The Company's normalized FFO guidance for all periods assumes that all of the Company's tenants and borrowers continue to meet all of their obligations to the Company. In addition, the Company's normalized FFO guidance (and related GAAP earnings projections) excludes gains and losses on the sales of assets and the impact of future, unannounced acquisitions, divestitures (including pursuant to tenant options to purchase) and capital transactions. Its guidance also excludes the future impact of (a) any rent or other amounts derived from (and any expenses related to) the Reset Right, whether through a negotiated resolution with Kindred or the appraisal process set forth in the Master Leases and (b) any expenses related to asset impairment, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, including in connection with the replacement of the Company's previous secured revolving credit facility with the new $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility, or additional costs, expenses or premiums incurred as a result of early debt retirement.
The Company's guidance is based on a number of other assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT. The Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.
FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs.

The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.

The Company considers EBITDA a profitability measure which indicates the Company's ability to service debt. The Company considers the net debt to proforma EBITDA ratio a useful measure to evaluate the Company's ability to pay its indebtedness. EBITDA presented herein is not necessarily comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is EBITDA necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
Scheduled Maturities of Borrowing Arrangements
The Company's indebtedness has the following maturities as of June 30, 2006 (in thousands):
