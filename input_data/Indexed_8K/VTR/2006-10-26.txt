Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") said today that third quarter 2006 normalized Funds from Operations ("FFO") rose 19.0 percent to $67.0 million, compared with $56.3 million in the third quarter of 2005. Normalized FFO per diluted share in the third quarter of 2006 increased 18.5 percent to $0.64 from $0.54 per diluted share for the comparable 2005 period. In the quarter ended September 30, 2006, the Company had 104.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, compared to 103.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding a year earlier.
LOUISVILLE, KY (October 26, 2006)
Normalized FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 was $184.0 million, or $1.76 per diluted share, a 28.8 percent increase from $142.9 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, for the comparable 2005 period.
Normalized FFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 excludes (a) one-time expenses totaling $7.4 million in connection with the Rent Reset process, (b) the benefit of a $1.8 million reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability relating to an IRS audit of the Company's 2001 tax year ("2001 Tax Audit"), which was recorded to income due to the favorable outcome of this matter in the third quarter of 2006 and (c) a $1.3 million expense relating to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees in connection with the Company's successful refinancing of its previous secured revolving credit facility with a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility during the second quarter of 2006. Results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2006 benefited from increased rent resulting from the Rent Reset on the 225 healthcare facilities the Company leases to Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: KND) ("Kindred"), the Company's successful implementation of its acquisition program and leading internal growth rate from its existing leases. Normalized FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 excludes a $0.4 million expense related to fees in connection with a bridge loan commitment obtained by the Company prior to the closing of the Provident Senior Living Trust acquisition, which was not used by the Company.
"With the successful completion of the Rent Reset, we are focused on delivering reliable, growing cash flows and superior risk adjusted returns to our shareholders as we execute on our strategic growth and diversification program. We expect to use our free cash flow to reinvest in acquisitions and increase our dividend in the first quarter of 2007," Ventas Chairman, President and CEO Debra A. Cafaro said.

VENTAS RAISES GUIDANCE FOR 2006 AND ISSUES 2007 GUIDANCE
With the completion of the Kindred Rent Reset, and assuming the Company closes the Senior Care transaction in the fourth quarter, Ventas expects its 2006 normalized FFO to be between $2.41 and $2.43 per diluted share, increased from its previous guidance of $2.25 to $2.27 per diluted share. If achieved, this projection represents 15 to 16 percent growth in normalized FFO per share over 2005.
The Company also said that, if the Senior Care transaction closes as expected, it should achieve 2007 normalized FFO of between $2.70 and $2.75 per diluted share and FAD of between $2.55 and $2.60 per diluted share.
The Company's normalized FFO and FAD guidance for all periods assumes that all of the Company's tenants and borrowers continue to meet all of their obligations to the Company and that the May 1, 2007 rent escalation in Master Lease 2 with Kindred (which is based on CPI) is 2.7 percent. In addition, the Company's normalized FFO guidance (and related GAAP earnings projections) excludes (a) gains and losses on the sales of assets, (b) the impact of future, unannounced acquisitions, divestitures (including pursuant to tenant options to purchase) and capital transactions, (c) one-time expenses of $7.4 million relating to the Rent Reset, (d) the benefit of a $1.8 million reversal of a contingent liability in connection with the favorable outcome of the 2001 Tax Audit, and (e) the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses or premiums incurred as a result of early debt retirement. FAD for all periods excludes straight-line rental adjustments.
The Company's guidance is based on a number of other assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.
A reconciliation of the Company's guidance to the Company's projected GAAP earnings is provided on a schedule attached to this press release. The Company may from time to time update its publicly announced guidance, but it is not obligated to do so.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO and FAD appropriate measures of performance of an equity REIT. The Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will
 
Ventas Reports Third Quarter Results
Page 12
October 26, 2006
be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FAD represents normalized FFO excluding straight-line rental adjustments. Currently, the Company's capital expenditures for its real estate portfolio are immaterial.
FFO and FAD presented herein are not necessarily comparable to FFO and FAD presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. FFO and FAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO or FAD necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs.
The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO and FAD should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
Guidance for the Years Ending December 31, 2007 and 2006
The following table illustrates the Company's guidance per diluted share for the years ending December 31, 2007 and 2006:

Net Debt to Pro Forma EBITDA
The following pro forma information considers the effect on net income, interest and depreciation of the Company's investments and other capital transactions, including the Senior Care Bridge Loan, that were completed during the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2006, and the Kindred Rent Reset, as if the transactions had been consummated as of the beginning of the period. The following table illustrates net debt to pro forma earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") (dollars in thousands):
 
The Company considers EBITDA a profitability measure which indicates the Company's ability to service debt. The Company considers the net debt to proforma EBITDA ratio a useful measure to evaluate the Company's ability to pay its indebtedness. EBITDA presented herein is not necessarily comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is EBITDA necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
