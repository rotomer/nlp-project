On February 20, 2007, Ventas, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2006.
A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated in this Item 2.02 by reference.
The press release states that the Company's normalized funds from operations ("FFO") for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006 were $71.2 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, as compared to $57.2 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005. The Company's funds available for distribution ("FAD") for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006 were $66.0 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, as compared to $51.3 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005. The Company's net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $40.8 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, as compared to $47.2 million, or $0.45 per diluted share (including income from discontinued operations of $5.4 million), for the comparable period in 2005.
For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company's normalized FFO was $255.2 million, or $2.44 per diluted share, as compared to $200.1 million, or $2.09 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company's FAD was $235.2 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, as compared to $185.8 million, or $1.94 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2005. For 2006, the Company's net income was $131.4 million, or $1.25 per diluted share, as compared to $130.6 million, or $1.36 per diluted share (including income from discontinued operations of $5.3 million), for 2005.
The press release also states that the Company expects its normalized FFO for the year ending December 31, 2007 to be between $2.70 and $2.75 per diluted share, and its FAD for the year ending to be between $2.55 and $2.60 per diluted share. The Company expects its net income for 2007 to be between $1.42 and $1.47 per diluted share. Assuming the Company closes its proposed acquisition of Sunrise Senior Living REIT early in the second quarter, however, it expects the acquisition to dilute normalized FFO by $0.05 to $0.07 per share, to dilute FAD by $0.09 to $0.11 per share, and to reduce net income by $0.30 to $0.32 per share for the year ending December 31, 2007.
This Current Report on Form 8-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

(together with its subsidiaries, "Kindred"), Brookdale Living Communities, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "Brookdale") and Alterra Healthcare Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, "Alterra") to meet and/or perform their obligations to indemnify, defend and hold the Company harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities under the Company's respective contractual arrangements with Kindred, Brookdale and Alterra; (c) the ability of the Company's operators, tenants, borrowers and managers, as applicable, to maintain the financial strength and liquidity necessary to satisfy their respective obligations and liabilities to third parties, including without limitation obligations under their existing credit facilities; (d) the Company's success in implementing its business strategy and its ability to identify, underwrite, finance, consummate and integrate diversifying acquisitions or investments, including those in different asset types and outside the United States; (e) the nature and extent of future competition; (f) the extent of future or pending healthcare reform and regulation, including cost containment measures and changes in reimbursement policies, procedures and rates; (g) increases in the Company's cost of borrowing; (h) the ability of the Company's operators and managers, as applicable, to deliver high quality services and to attract residents and patients; (i) the results of litigation affecting the Company; (j) changes in general economic conditions and/or economic conditions in the markets in which the Company may, from time to time, compete; (k) the Company's ability to pay down, refinance, restructure and/or extend its indebtedness as it becomes due; (l) the movement of interest rates and the resulting impact on the value of and the accounting for the Company's interest rate swap agreement; (m) the Company's ability and willingness to maintain its qualification as a REIT due to economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations; (n) final determination of the Company's taxable net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 and for the year ending December 31, 2007; (o) the ability and willingness of the Company's tenants to renew their leases with the Company upon expiration of the leases, including without limitation Kindred's willingness to renew any or all of its bundles of leased properties expiring in 2008, and the Company's ability to relet its properties on the same or better terms in the event such leases expire and are not renewed by the existing tenants; (p) risks associated with the proposed acquisition of Sunrise Senior Living REIT, including the Company's ability to successfully complete the transaction on the contemplated terms and to timely and fully realize the expected revenues and cost savings therefrom; (q) the movement of U.S. and Canadian exchange rates; (r) year-over-year changes in the Consumer Price Index and the effect of those changes on the rent escalators, including the rent escalator for Master Lease 2 with Kindred, and the Company's earnings; and (s) the impact on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of the Company's operators, tenants, borrowers and managers, as
applicable, resulting from increased operating costs and uninsured liabilities for professional liability claims, and the ability of the Company's operators, tenants, borrowers and managers to accurately estimate the magnitude of such liabilities. Many of these factors are beyond the control of the Company and its management.
On February 20, 2007, the Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.475 per share, payable in cash on March 30, 2007 to stockholders of record on March 20, 2007.

BOARD INCREASES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND BY 20 PERCENT
Ventas said that its Board of Directors voted to increase the Company's first quarter 2007 dividend to $0.475 per share, an increase of 20 percent from the quarterly 2006 dividend of $0.395 per share. The first quarter dividend is payable March 30, 2007 to stockholders of record on March 20, 2007.
"With our superior cash flow growth in 2006 and confidence in our growing, diversified pool of high-quality healthcare and seniors housing assets, we are pleased to increase our dividend by 20 percent to an annualized rate of $1.90 per share," Cafaro added.
Results for the fourth quarter and the year ended December 31, 2006 benefited from increased rent resulting from the Rent Reset on the 225 healthcare facilities the Company leases to Kindred Healthcare, Inc.

Normalized FFO for the year ended December 31, 2006 excludes (a) a fourth quarter gain from the sale of securities totaling $1.4 million, (b) one-time expenses recorded in the third quarter totaling $7.4 million in connection with the Rent Reset process, (c) the benefit of a $1.8 million reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability relating to an IRS audit of the Company's 2001 tax year ("2001 Tax Audit"), which was recorded to income in the third quarter due to the favorable outcome of this matter, and (d) a $1.3 million expense relating to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees in connection with the Company's successful refinancing in April 2006 of its previous $300 million secured revolving credit facility with a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility").
Normalized FFO for the year ended December 31, 2005 excludes (a) a $0.4 million expense related to fees in connection with a bridge loan commitment obtained by the Company prior to the closing of the Provident acquisition, which was not used by the Company, (b) net proceeds received by Ventas from a litigation settlement with Sullivan & Cromwell of $15.9 million, (c) a contribution to the Ventas Charitable Foundation of $2.0 million, (d) a net gain on swap breakage of $1.0 million and (e) the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees of $1.4 million in connection with the payoff of the Company's commercial mortgage backed securities loan.
GAAP NET INCOME

FULL YEAR 2006 RESULTS
Rental income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $418.4 million, of which $220.9 million resulted from leases with Kindred. Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $296.9 million.

During 2006, the Company incurred one-time expenses totaling $7.4 million in connection with the Rent Reset process, which included appraisal expenses, investment banking fees, litigation costs and legal fees.
NORMALIZED FFO GUIDANCE FOR 2007
Prior to the announcement of the Sunrise REIT acquisition, Ventas announced that it expects its 2007 normalized FFO to be between $2.70 and $2.75 per diluted share. As part of the Sunrise REIT acquisition announcement, Ventas stated that, assuming the transaction closes early in the second quarter of 2007, it expects the Sunrise REIT acquisition to dilute normalized FFO in 2007 by about $0.05 to $0.07 per share and to break even in 2008, excluding development assets.
The Company's normalized FFO guidance for all periods assumes that all of the Company's tenants and borrowers continue to meet all of their obligations to the Company and that the May 1, 2007 rent escalation in Master Lease 2 with Kindred (which is based on CPI) is 2.7 percent. In addition, the Company's normalized FFO guidance (and related U.S. generally accepted accounting principals ("GAAP") earnings projections) excludes (a) gains and losses on the sales of assets, (b) the impact of future, unannounced acquisitions, divestitures (including pursuant to tenant options to purchase) and capital transactions, (c) one-time merger expenses that are not capitalized under GAAP, such as costs for foreign exchange hedge agreements, (d) the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses or premiums incurred as a result of early debt retirement and (e) any dilution resulting from the Company's convertible notes.
The Company's guidance is based on a number of other assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.
A reconciliation of the Company's guidance to the Company's projected GAAP earnings is provided on a schedule attached to this press release. The Company may from time to time update its publicly announced guidance, but it is not obligated to do so.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO and FAD appropriate measures of performance of an equity REIT. The Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FAD represents normalized FFO excluding straight-line rental adjustments. Currently, the Company's capital expenditures for its real estate portfolio are immaterial.

FFO and FAD presented herein are not necessarily comparable to FFO and FAD presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Neither FFO nor FAD should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO or FAD necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs.
The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO and FAD should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
Guidance for the Year Ending December 31, 2007
The following table illustrates the Company's guidance per diluted share for the year ending December 31, 2007. As part of the Sunrise REIT acquisition announcement, Ventas stated that, assuming the transaction closes early in the second quarter of 2007, it expects the Sunrise REIT acquisition to dilute normalized FFO in 2007 by about $0.05 to $0.07 per share and to break even in 2008, excluding development assets.

Net Debt to Pro Forma EBITDA
The following pro forma information considers the effect on net income, interest and depreciation of the Company's investments and other capital transactions that were completed during the three months ended December 31, 2006, as if the transactions had been consummated as of the beginning of the period. The following table illustrates net debt to pro forma annualized

earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") (dollars in thousands):
 
The Company considers EBITDA a profitability measure which indicates the Company's ability to service debt. The Company considers the net debt to pro forma EBITDA ratio a useful measure to evaluate the Company's ability to pay its indebtedness. EBITDA presented herein is not necessarily comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is EBITDA necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
