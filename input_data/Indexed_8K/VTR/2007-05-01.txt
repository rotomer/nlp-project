On April 26, 2007, Ventas, Inc. (the "Company") completed the acquisition of all of the assets of Sunrise REIT (the "Sunrise Acquisition") pursuant to the terms of a purchase agreement dated as of January 14, 2007, as amended, among the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries, Ventas SSL Ontario I, Inc. (formerly 2124678 Ontario Inc., the "Securities Purchaser") and Ventas SSL Ontario II, Inc. (formerly 2124680 Ontario Inc., the "Asset Purchaser" and, together with the Securities Purchaser, the "Purchasers"), Sunrise REIT, Sunrise REIT Trust ("Sub Trust") and Sunrise REIT GP Inc. ("Sunrise GP"), in its capacity as general partner of Sunrise Canadian UPREIT, LP ("UPREIT"). The aggregate consideration for the Sunrise Acquisition, including the assumption of debt, was approximately Cdn $2.26 billion (or approximately USD $1.96 billion, using the Company's effective exchange rate, taking into account its existing foreign exchange contracts).
At the effective time of the Sunrise Acquisition, the Securities Purchaser purchased all of the interests and assumed all of the liabilities of Sunrise REIT Canadian Holdings Inc. ("Canco") and certain of Sunrise REIT's intercompany notes held by Sub Trust, and the Asset Purchaser acquired all of Sunrise REIT's remaining assets and liabilities from Sunrise REIT, Sub Trust and UPREIT. Immediately following the Sunrise Acquisition, each unit of beneficial interest of Sunrise REIT outstanding immediately prior to the effective time was redeemed at a redemption price of Cdn $16.50 in cash without any action on the part of the unitholders.
As a result of the Sunrise Acquisition, the Company acquired a 100% interest in 18 senior living communities and a 75-85% interest in 59 additional senior living communities, with the minority interest in those 59 communities being owned by affiliates of Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. ("Sunrise"). Of the 77 communities, 66 are located in metropolitan areas of 19 U.S. states and 11 are located in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and British Columbia. In addition, the Company expects to acquire for a fixed price two newly constructed communities in the U.S. and Canada in 2007 or 2008.
The letter agreement dated January 14, 2007 (the "Letter Agreement") between the Company and Sunrise as to modifications to various management and other agreements and contractual relationships between Sunrise and its affiliates, on the one hand, and Sunrise REIT and its affiliates, on the other hand (the "Existing Agreements"), remains in effect. Although not required, the Company and Sunrise may enter into various amendments to the Existing Agreements to further address the matters set out in the Letter Agreement, the terms of which were described in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 19, 2007.
Upon consummation of the Sunrise Acquisition, the Company and Sunrise REIT entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to settle all outstanding litigation against Sunrise REIT, as disclosed in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 12, 2007.
The Company funded the Sunrise Acquisition through borrowings under the Credit Agreement (defined below), the issuance of 700,000 shares of its Series A Senior Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Shares"), and the assumption of $880 million of existing mortgage debt.
A copy of the press release issued by the Company and Sunrise REIT on April 26, 2007 announcing the completion of the Sunrise Acquisition is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated in this Item 2.01 by reference.
 
On April 26, 2007, the Company, together with certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, and Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Ventas Realty"), as borrower, entered into an Interim Loan and Guaranty Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation, as Administrative Agent, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as Syndication Agent, Merrill Lynch & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Book Runners, and the lenders referred to therein. Ventas Realty borrowed $530 million under the Credit Agreement to fund a portion of the purchase price of the Sunrise Acquisition.
Borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to an applicable percentage over (i) in the case of Eurodollar rate loans, a one-, two- or three-month Eurodollar rate, at Ventas Realty's option, or (ii) in the case of base rate loans, the higher of (x) the federal funds rate in effect for the relevant period plus 0.50% and (y) the annual rate of interest quoted in "The Wall Street Journal," Money Rates Section as the "prime rate." The applicable percentage is 1.25% for Eurodollar rate loans and zero for base rate loans. However, if the loans are not repaid in full on or prior to October 26, 2007, the applicable percentage will increase to 2.00% for Eurodollar rate loans and 1.00% for base rate loans.
Ventas Realty's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its other subsidiaries identified therein.
The Credit Agreement matures on October 26, 2007, but may be extended, at Ventas Realty's option, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, for an additional period of six months. Loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement may be repaid from time to time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs, if any, with respect to Eurodollar rate loans. Loans outstanding must be repaid in the event Ventas Realty, the Company or any of the other guarantors issues unsecured notes or otherwise incurs indebtedness in excess of $10 million (other than certain specified indebtedness as set forth in the Credit Agreement).
The Credit Agreement imposes various restrictions on Ventas Realty, the Company and the other guarantors, including restrictions pertaining to: (i) liens; (ii) investments; (iii) the incurrence of additional indebtedness; (iv) mergers, sales of assets and dissolutions; (v) certain dividend, distribution and other payments; (vi) permitted businesses; (vii) transactions with affiliates; (viii) agreements limiting certain guarantees or liens; and (ix) the maintenance of certain consolidated total leverage, secured debt leverage and unsecured leverage ratios, consolidated fixed charge and unencumbered interest coverage ratios and minimum consolidated adjusted net worth.
The Credit Agreement contains usual and customary events of default. If a default occurs and is continuing, Ventas Realty may be required to repay all amounts outstanding thereunder.
The foregoing description is qualified by reference in its entirety to the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated in this Item 2.03 by reference.
 
On April 26, 2007, the Company issued and sold the Shares through a private placement pursuant to a Purchase Agreement dated April 26, 2007 (the "Purchase Agreement") among the Company, Ventas Realty and the Purchasers named therein (the "Purchasers") for an aggregate purchase price of $698,250,000 (after giving effect to a $1,750,000 deduction representing a commitment fee) in reliance on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). The Purchase Agreement contemplates the resale of the Shares by the Purchasers to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated under the Act. The exemptions under Section 4 (2) and Rule 144A of the Act are, in part, based upon the representations of the Purchasers in the Purchase Agreement that, among other things, each of the Purchasers is a "qualified institutional buyer" as defined by Rule 144A under the Act and that the Purchasers will offer and sell the Shares only to persons whom they, or their agents, reasonably believe are qualified institutional buyers. The Shares are governed by the terms of the Certificate of Designation of Relative Rights, Preferences, Limitations and Other Rights of Series A Senior Preferred Stock (the "Certificate of Designation").
The Company used the proceeds from the sale of the Shares to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Sunrise Acquisition.
Pursuant to the Certificate of Designation, the holders of the Shares are entitled to receive in cash, as and when declared by the Company's Board of Directors, dividends in an amount equal to LIBOR plus 1.25% per annum, subject to specified increases on the date that is three months after the date of issuance and every month thereafter. Dividends are payable monthly in arrears on the 15th day of each month, beginning June 15, 2007. The Shares may be redeemed at the Company's option, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference (described below), plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the date of redemption. In addition, under certain circumstances relating to the receipt of net proceeds from capital contributions or the issuance of stock, the Company will be required to apply such proceeds to redeem the Shares. If the Company undergoes certain change in control transactions, the Company is required to make an offer to repurchase all of the Shares at a purchase price equal to the 100% of the liquidation preference, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the repurchase date.
 
The Shares generally have no voting rights, except as expressly set forth in the Certificate of Designation. If the Company fails to pay dividends on the Shares for six months, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors constituting the Company's Board of Directors will be increased by two, and the holders of the outstanding Shares will be entitled to elect those two additional directors, voting together as a single class.
The Shares have a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, either voluntarily or involuntarily, the holders of the Shares will be entitled to receive out of the Company's assets, prior to the holders of the Company's common stock and any other class or series of capital stock with rights junior to the Shares, for each Share held by such holders, the liquidation preference.
In connection with the sale of the Shares, the Company and the Purchasers entered into a Registration Rights Agreement dated as of April 26, 2007 (the "Registration Rights Agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, the Company agreed to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), in certain circumstances, and to use its commercially reasonable best efforts to have declared effective by the Commission, up to two registration statements covering resales of the Shares.
On April 26, 2007, the Company entered into letter agreements with Purchasers of the Shares (each, a "Board Waiver") waiving certain stock ownership limitations contained in Article XII of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, with respect to the Shares under the terms and conditions set forth therein.
The foregoing description is qualified by reference in its entirety to the Certificate of Designation, the form of Board Waiver, the Purchase Agreement, and the Registration Rights Agreement, copies of which are filed herewith as Exhibits 4.1, 4.2, 10.2 and 10.3, respectively, and incorporated in this Item 3.02 by reference.
 
The Certificate of Designation provides, among other things, for preferential rights of the Series A Senior Preferred Stock as to dividends and liquidation over those of the Company's common stock, par value $0.25 per share ("Common Stock"), and a prohibition on the payment of dividends on the Common Stock (other than dividends in shares of Common Stock) or the redemption or purchase of the Common Stock by the Company unless full cumulative dividends on the outstanding Shares have been declared and paid.
 
On April 25, 2007, the Company filed with the Delaware Secretary of State the Certificate of Designation authorizing and fixing the terms of the Series A Senior Preferred Stock.
 
Financial statements of the business acquired will be filed by amendment to this Current Report on Form 8-K no later than 71 days following the date that this Report is required to be filed.
 
Pro forma financial information will be filed by amendment to this Current Report on Form 8-K no later than 71 days following the date that this Report is required to be filed.

Dear Authorized Officer:
This letter is in response to the request by [PURCHASER] (""), in connection with the Series A Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, dated April 26, 2007 among the Company, Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership and the purchasers listed on thereto, for a waiver of the provisions of Article XII of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company with respect to Purchaser as described in the letter from Purchaser to the Company dated April 26, 2007, which is attached hereto (the ""). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Request Letter.
Purchaser
Schedule I
Request Letter
The Board hereby waives, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this letter and the Request Letter, the application of Article XII to Purchaser insofar as Article XII would otherwise prohibit Purchaser from Beneficially Owning more than 9.9% of the Senior Preferred Stock. Pursuant to this Waiver, Purchaser shall be permitted to Beneficially Own at any time, and from time to time, during the Waiver Period up to 60% of the then outstanding shares of Senior Preferred Stock.
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that this Waiver relates only to the limitation that no person Beneficially Own more than 9.9% of the outstanding Senior Preferred Stock and does not constitute a waiver of any other limitations of Article XII. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time during the Waiver Period (a) Purchaser Beneficially Owns more than 9.9% of the total outstanding equity of the Company (measured by value) or (b) partly or wholly as a result of Purchaser's Beneficial Ownership of equity in the Company, any "individual" (within the meaning of Section 542(a)(2) of the Code, as modified by Section 856(h) of the Code) Beneficially Owns more than 9.9% of the total outstanding equity of the Company (measured by value), a portion of the stock in question, to the extent such stock causes the 9.9% threshold to be exceeded, shall be treated as Excess Shares (effective as of the close of business on the day prior to the date on which such 9.9% threshold was first exceeded), and the Company shall also be entitled to pursue any other remedy available at law or equity. Moreover, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that if at any time Purchaser Beneficially Owns more than 60% of the Senior Preferred Stock outstanding at such time, such Senior Preferred Stock, to the extent it exceeds the 60% threshold, shall be treated as Excess Shares (effective as of the close of

business on the day prior to the date on which such 60% threshold was first exceeded), and the Company shall also be entitled to pursue any other remedy available at law or equity.
The Board hereby agrees that if Purchaser seeks to sell, assign, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any Senior Preferred Stock at any time or from time to time, the Board will grant each transferee of Purchaser (or any subsequent transferee of Senior Preferred Stock, whether or not such subsequent transferee's transferor has sought a waiver) a waiver on the same terms and conditions as this Waiver (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this paragraph), but only if such transferee executes a letter that in form and in substance contains substantially the same covenants and agreements as the Request Letter.
If this letter accurately sets forth our understanding, please sign the letter where indicated below and return a signed copy to me.

minimum amount of $1,000,000 or in such greater amount which is an integral multiple of $100,000;
(d) if fewer than all Loans of a particular type at the time outstanding shall be continued or converted, such continuation or conversion shall be made pro rata among the applicable Lenders in accordance with the respective principal amount of such Loans held by the applicable Lenders immediately prior to such continuation or conversion;
(e) no Base Rate Loan (or portion thereof) may be converted to a Eurodollar Rate Loan and no Eurodollar Rate Loan may be continued as a Eurodollar Rate Loan if, after such conversion or continuation, and after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of Loans, an aggregate of more than five (5) separate Eurodollar Rate Loans would be outstanding hereunder with respect to a Lender (for purposes of determining the number of such Loans outstanding, Loans with different Interest Periods shall be counted as different Eurodollar Rate Loans even if made on the same date);
(f) the Interest Period with respect to a new Eurodollar Rate Loan effected by a continuation or conversion shall commence on the date of such continuation or conversion;

(or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 3:00 p.m. (New York City time) shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
(b) (i) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by ) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, then:

Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights that the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender with respect to any amount owing under this shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

(c) .If at any time an Indemnified Party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the Indemnified Party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such Indemnified Party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement; , that an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any such settlement effected without its consent if such indemnifying party (1) reimburses such Indemnified Party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable and (2) provides written notice to the Indemnified Party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement.

Demand Registration
(a) If at any time during the Demand Period the Issuer shall receive a written Purchaser Request that the Issuer file a registration statement under the Securities Act, then the Issuer shall, within ten (10) days of the receipt thereof, give written notice of such request to all Holders and, subject to the limitations of Section 3(b) below, shall file (as expeditiously as practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such request) and use its commercially reasonable best efforts to have declared effective, a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to all Registrable Securities which the Holders request to be registered within eighteen (18) days of the mailing of such notice by the Issuer in accordance with Section 9(g) below.
(b) If the Holders intend to distribute the Registrable Securities covered by their request by means of an underwriting, they shall so advise the Issuer as a part of their request made pursuant to this Section 3 and the Issuer shall, to the extent practicable, include such information in the written notice referred to in Section 3(a). In such event, the obligation of any Holder to
 
include such Holder's Registrable Securities in such registration shall be conditioned upon such Holder's participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holder's Registrable Securities in the underwriting (unless otherwise mutually agreed by a majority in interest of the Holders participating in the underwriting and such Holder) to the extent provided herein. A majority in interest of the Holders of Registrable Securities participating in the underwriting, in consultation with the Issuer and subject to the approval of the Issuer (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), shall select the managing underwriter or underwriters in such underwriting. All Holders proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting shall (together with the Issuer as provided in Section 5(m)) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters so selected for such underwriting by a majority in interest of such Holders; provided, however, that no Holder (or any of their assignees) shall be required to make any representations, warranties or indemnities except as they relate to such Holder's ownership of shares and authority to enter into the underwriting agreement and to such Holder's intended method of distribution, and the liability of such Holder shall be limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds from the offering received by such Holder. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3, if the managing underwriter advises a Holder that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten, then the Holder shall so advise the Issuer and the Issuer shall so advise all Holders of Registrable Securities which would otherwise be underwritten pursuant hereto, and the number of shares of Registrable Securities that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated as follows: (i) first, among Holders of Registrable Securities that have elected to participate in such underwritten offering, in proportion (as nearly as practicable) to the aggregate amount of Registrable Securities held by all such Holders, until such Holders have included in the underwriting all shares requested by such holders to be included, and (ii) thereafter, among all other holders of the Securities, if any, that have the right and have elected to participate in such underwritten offering, in proportion (as nearly as practicable) to the amount of shares of the Securities owned by such holders. Without the consent of a majority in interest of the Holders of Registrable Securities participating in a registration referred to in Section 3(a), no securities other than Registrable Securities shall be covered by such registration if the inclusion of such other securities would result in a reduction of the number of Registrable Securities covered by such registration or included in any underwriting or if, in the opinion of the managing underwriter, the inclusion of such other securities would adversely impact the marketing of such offering.
(c) The Issuer shall be obligated to effect two (2) Demand Registration Statements pursuant to Purchaser Requests under this Section 3.
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders requesting a Registration Statement pursuant to this Section 3, a certificate signed by the chief executive officer of the Issuer stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Issuer, it would be detrimental to the Issuer and its stockholders for such Registration Statement to be filed or maintained by reason of (i) a material pending financing, acquisition, disposition, corporate reorganization, merger, public offering of securities, or other transaction involving or being contemplated by the Issuer or (ii) the Issuer being in possession of material non-public information not otherwise then required by law to be publicly disclosed that it deems advisable not to disclose in the Registration Statement, and it is therefore essential to defer the filing of or suspend such Registration Statement, the Issuer shall have the right to defer such filing for a period of not more than sixty (60) days after receipt of the Purchaser Request; provided, however, that
 
the Issuer may not utilize this right more than once in any six (6) month period; , , that the Issuer shall at all times in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to cause any Registration Statement required by this Agreement to be filed or restored as soon as possible thereafter.

If any proceeding shall be brought or asserted against any person entitled to indemnity hereunder (an ""), such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the person from whom indemnity is sought (the "") in writing, and the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with defense thereof; provided, that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations or liabilities pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent that it is materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement.
Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings
Indemnified Party
Indemnifying Party
An Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party or Parties unless: (i) the Indemnifying Party has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses; or (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed to assume the defense of such proceeding (with sufficient promptness to ensure that the Indemnified Parties are not prejudiced by delay), or shall employ incompetent counsel in any such proceeding; or (iii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and such Indemnified Party shall have reasonably determined that a conflict of interest is likely to exist if the same counsel were to represent such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party (in which case, if such Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense thereof and such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party). The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any pending proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is a party, unless such settlement includes (i) an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party.
All reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party (including reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses to the extent incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such proceeding in a manner not inconsistent with this Section) shall be paid to the Indemnified Party, as incurred, within ten Business Days of written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party (regardless of whether it may be ultimately determined that an Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder; , that the Indemnifying Party may require such Indemnified Party to undertake to reimburse all such fees and expenses
provided
 
to the extent it is finally judicially determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder). Any other provision in this Agreement notwithstanding, the Indemnifying Party shall only be liable for the reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses of one separate counsel representing the Indemnified Parties (and one local counsel per jurisdiction as appropriate).
(d) . If a claim for indemnification under Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an Indemnified Party (by reason of public policy or otherwise), then each Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action, statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any losses shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c), any reasonable attorneys' or other reasonable fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any proceeding to the extent such party would have been indemnified for such fees or expenses if the indemnification provided for in this Section was available to such party in accordance with its terms.
Contribution
The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Holder shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the proceeds actually received by such Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities subject to the proceeding exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section are in addition to any liability that the Indemnifying Parties may have to the Indemnified Parties.
