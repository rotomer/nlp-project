With reference to and hereof, Lessor agrees that Tenant's rights to convert licensed beds on the terms set forth in hereof and/or voluntary remove from service or delicense beds on the terms set forth in hereof do not replace Tenant's rights to delicense beds as and to the extent permitted by hereof. For example, assume that a particular SN Facility had 100 licensed beds as of the Commencement Date, that, for purposes of this example, at all times the Permissible Reduction Percentage applicable to such Facility is 10% (so that, pursuant to hereof, a reduction in the number of licensed beds to 90 beds would not cause a default under ), that such SN Facility is not listed on hereof and that the minimum number of non-banked skilled nursing care beds that is required at such SN Facility as set forth on is 95 beds. If, in accordance with the terms of hereof, the number of licensed beds at such SN Facility is reduced to 95 beds, neither nor hereof would prohibit Tenant, pursuant to hereof, from thereafter allowing an additional 5 beds to be delicensed. On the other hand, if Tenant first allowed 5 beds to be delicensed pursuant to hereof, Tenant could not thereafter proceed under hereof if such proceeding would result in the loss of licensure of any bed, as 95 beds is the minimum as described above (but Tenant could still allow the number of beds to be further reduced from 95 beds to 90 beds pursuant to , without causing a default under such ).

. During the Term, Tenant shall at all times keep each Leased Property, and all property located in or on any Leased Property, including Leasehold Improvements, Fixtures and Tenant's Personal Property, insured with the kinds and amounts of insurance described below. This insurance shall be written by companies authorized to do insurance business in the State in which the applicable Leased Property is located, provided, however, that the insurers or reinsurers issuing policies covering general liability and/or professional liability claims (or providing reinsurance coverage with respect to such claims) need only to have such authorizations to do insurance business as are required by applicable law. All companies providing insurance required by the terms of this (including, without limitation, any Captive Insurance Company) must have a rating at least as high as the rating required by any applicable Facility Mortgagee. The policies must name as loss payee (i) the holder of any mortgage, deed of trust or other security agreement ("") securing any Encumbrance placed on the applicable Leased Property in accordance with the provisions of ("") by way of a standard form of mortgagee's loss payable endorsement or (ii) if no such Facility Mortgage encumbers the applicable Leased Property, Lessor and, in the case of any commercial general liability and/or umbrella liability insurance coverages, must name Lessor and any Superior Mortgagee(s) as additional insureds. Losses shall be payable to Lessor and/or Superior Mortgagee as provided in . Any loss adjustment shall require the written consent of Lessor, Tenant, Leasehold Mortgagee and Facility Mortgagee whenever the loss exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the Facility's Fair Market Value. Evidence of insurance shall be deposited with Lessor and, if requested, with any Superior Lessor, Leasehold Mortgagee and Facility Mortgagee(s). If any provision of any Facility Mortgage requires deposits of insurance premiums to be made with such Facility Mortgagee, Tenant shall either pay to Lessor monthly the amounts required and Lessor shall transfer such amounts to each Facility Mortgagee, or, pursuant to written direction by Lessor, Tenant shall make such deposits directly with such Facility Mortgagee. The policies on each Leased Property, including the Leasehold Improvements, and Fixtures and Tenant's Personal Property, shall insure against the following risks:

Relative to the insurance referenced in this , Tenant shall be permitted to use a claims made policy form rather than an occurrence based policy form for its primary, and/or its excess liability, CGL insurance, only if:
Section 13.1.4
CGL
Section 13.1.4
(a) an occurrence based form of primary or excess liability, as applicable, CGL insurance policy cannot be obtained solely because occurrence based forms of primary or excess liability, as applicable, CGL insurance are not offered in the insurance market place for for-profit hospital and/or nursing center companies or
(b) a majority of the five (5) largest (determined by revenue) companies (exclusive of Tenant) in the for-profit hospital and/or nursing center industry maintain claims made forms of primary or excess liability, as applicable, CGL insurance for their primary or excess liability, as applicable, CGL insurance policies.
(For example, relative to the foregoing conditions, if occurrence based forms of primary CGL insurance are offered in the insurance market place for for-profit hospital and/or nursing center companies, but Tenant is unable to obtain an occurrence based form of excess liability CGL insurance solely because occurrence based forms of excess liability CGL insurance are not offered in the insurance market place for for-profit hospital and/or nursing center companies, and a majority of the aforesaid five largest companies maintain occurrence based forms of primary CGL insurance and claims made forms of excess liability CGL insurance, a claims made form of excess liability CGL insurance would be permitted subject to compliance with the other requirements of this , but a claims made form of primary CGL insurance would not be permitted). Prior to making any such switch to or renewing any claims made policy, Tenant shall be obligated to provide to Lessor supporting evidence demonstrating the existence of condition (a) or (b), and the sufficiency of such evidence shall be subject to the advance written approval of Lessor, in its reasonable discretion. If Tenant so switches to a claims made form of policy, in addition to complying with the requirements referenced below in this
Section 13.1.4
 
, Tenant shall be obligated to switch back to occurrence based coverage at the end of the then current claims made policy term unless condition (a) or (b) exists as demonstrated by supporting evidence reasonably approved in advance and in writing by Lessor. If Tenant satisfies the above referenced tests for switching to, or continuing to maintain, a claims made form of policy, any claims made policy that it purchases must include therein the right to purchase a "tail" that insures against so called "incurred but not reported claims" for a period of at least three (3) years following the expiration of such claims made policy. In addition, from and after any such switch to a claims made form of policy, Tenant must, after the expiration of each claims made policy that Tenant obtains, as to each such expiring claims made policy, either:
Section 13.1.4
(i) continue to insure Lessor and all Facility Mortgagees and Superior Lessors with the required amount of primary and/or excess liability, as applicable depending upon the nature of such expiring claims made policy, CGL insurance coverage, on a claims made policy form that includes coverage against all so-called "incurred but not reported claims" relating to any period on or prior to the expiration of the expiring policy (""), an additional ten (10) years following the expiration of such expiring claims made policy (which coverage may be obtained, for example, (A) through the renewal or rolling-over of a claims made based CGL policy providing the required amounts of coverage and including coverage against Previous Period Unreported Claims for consecutive 1-year periods for such ten (10) year period, or (B) through the purchase of a three (3) year claims made based CGL "tail" policy providing the required amounts of coverage and including coverage against Previous Period Unreported Claims followed by purchases of claims made based CGL policies providing the required amounts of coverage and including coverage against all Previous Period Unreported Claims for consecutive 1-year periods for the remaining seven (7) years of such ten (10) year period) (in connection with the purchase of claims made CGL insurance coverage pursuant to this subsection (i), any claims made CGL insurance coverage that is obtained by Tenant may exclude therefrom any claims incurred during any period that an occurrence based form of primary or excess liability, as applicable depending on the nature of the expiring claims made policy, CGL insurance policy providing the required amounts of coverage and insuring Lessor and all Facility Mortgagees and Superior Lessors was in effect), or

The term "full replacement cost," as used herein, shall mean the actual replacement cost of the property requiring replacement from time to time including an increased cost of construction endorsement, without reduction or deduction for depreciation. Tenant shall have the full replacement cost redetermined by an accredited appraiser approved by Lessor (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), hereinafter referred to as "impartial appraiser", every five years during the Term, and at such other times that either party believes that full replacement cost has increased or decreased. Tenant shall forthwith, on receipt of such determination by such impartial appraiser, give written notice thereof to Lessor. The determination of such impartial appraiser shall be final and binding on the parties hereto, and Tenant shall forthwith increase, or may decrease, the amount of the insurance carried pursuant to this Section, as the case may be, to the amount so determined by the impartial appraiser. Each party shall pay one-half (

. In addition to the insurance described above, Tenant shall maintain such additional insurance as may reasonably be required from time to time by any Facility Mortgagee and, further, shall at all times maintain adequate worker's compensation insurance coverage for all persons employed by Tenant on each Leased Property. Such worker's compensation insurance shall be in accordance with the requirements of applicable local, state and federal law.

Lessor and Tenant agree that (insofar as and to the extent that such agreement may be effective without invalidating or making it impossible to secure insurance coverage from responsible insurance companies doing business in the State) with respect to any property loss that is covered by insurance then being carried by Lessor or Tenant, respectively, the party carrying such insurance and suffering said loss releases the other of and from any and all claims with respect to such loss where such insurance is valid and collectible respecting any such loss; and they further agree that their respective insurance companies shall have no right of subrogation against the other on account thereof, even though extra premium may result therefrom. Nothing contained herein is intended, nor shall it be construed, to require that Lessor maintain any insurance coverage.
Section 13.4
Waiver of Subrogation
 
All of the policies of insurance referred to in this Section shall be written in form satisfactory to Lessor and any Superior Lessor and Facility Mortgagee and by insurance companies satisfactory to Lessor and any Superior Lessor and Facility Mortgagee. Lessor agrees that it will not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its approval as to the form of the policies of insurance or as to the insurance companies selected by Tenant. Tenant shall pay all of the premiums therefor not later than the earlier of the date which is thirty (30) days after Tenant's receipt of an invoice therefor or the due date of the applicable premium, and shall deliver such policies or certificates thereof to Lessor prior to their effective date (and, with respect to any renewal policy, prior to the expiration of the existing policy), and in the event of the failure of Tenant either to effect such insurance in the names herein called for or to pay the premiums therefor, or to deliver such policies or certificates thereof to Lessor and each Superior Lessor and Facility Mortgagee at the times required, Lessor shall be entitled, but shall have no obligation, to effect such insurance and pay the premiums therefor, which premiums shall be repayable to Lessor upon written demand therefor, and failure to repay the same shall constitute an Event of Default within the meaning of . Each insurer mentioned in this Section shall agree, by endorsement on the policy or policies issued by it, or by independent instrument furnished to Lessor and any Superior Lessor and Facility Mortgagee, that it will give to Lessor thirty (30) days' written notice before the policy or policies in question shall be materially altered, allowed to expire or canceled.

If the parties shall be unable to agree thereon, the proper and reasonable limits or deductible amount, as applicable, for such insurance to be carried shall be determined by an impartial third party selected by the parties.

If Tenant exercises a purchase option relative to a particular Leased Property(ies), the closing with respect thereto will occur within forty-five (45) days of Tenant's receipt of the applicable . At such closing, Lessor will, by special warranty deed (or, if a particular Leased Property is subject to an Existing Ground Lease, by a special warranty assignment, rather than a special warranty deed), convey to Tenant or its designee all of Lessor's right, title and interest in the subject Leased Property(ies) (or, if a particular Leased Property is subject to an Existing Ground Lease, in the subject Existing Ground Lease), subject to the Permitted Encumbrances, and will cause to be released any Facility Mortgage(s) or other liens created by Lessor or its agents or employees relative to the subject Leased Property(ies) (and, if Lessor is unable to cause such release(s) as of the initially scheduled closing date, the closing date shall be extended as necessary to allow Lessor additional time to cause such release(s)), and Tenant will pay in cash, to or as directed by Lessor, the purchase price therefor, as described in below, subject, if applicable as described below, to a credit against the purchase price in favor of Tenant and in the amount, if any, described below. Such conveyance will be on an "AS IS", "WITH ALL FAULTS" basis and without any representation or warranty (except as set forth in the aforesaid special warranty deed (or, if applicable as described above, the aforesaid special warranty assignment)). If consummation of any such conveyance would result in a violation or breach of any Existing Ground Lease or other Permitted Encumbrance, or of the terms or conditions of any applicable Authorization or reimbursement or provider agreement, Tenant shall be obligated, at its expense and as a condition to Lessor's obligation to close, to obtain, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lessor, any consents or approvals as may be necessary to avoid any such violation or breach. At such closing, Tenant shall execute and deliver to Lessor an instrument pursuant to which Tenant shall represent and warrant to, and covenant with, Lessor that (a) Tenant is purchasing the subject Leased Property(ies) with the intention of selling the same and (b) Tenant's acquisition from Lessor will qualify as an acquisition of assets "solely for rental or investment purposes" that is exempt from the notification and waiting period requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 18a et. seq.) under (16 C.F.R. 802.5). Upon the occurrence of such closing, this Lease will terminate, in accordance with , insofar as it applies to the purchased Leased Property(ies), but all accrued obligations, or obligations that survive termination, with respect to the purchased Leased Property(ies) shall survive such termination.

If, as a result of such cure, the number of the Leased Properties as to which an Event of Default under and/or of this Lease is reduced to a number fewer than the that is applicable to this Lease, Lessor will, for so long as such condition continues to exist, be precluded from exercising termination and/or dispossession rights and remedies against all Leased Properties covered by this Lease on account of the then remaining Event(s) of Default under and/or of this Lease, but not on account of any other Event of Default under this Lease.

The Purchase Option EBITDAR for a particular Leased Property will equal the highest twelve (12) consecutive month EBITDAR for such Leased Property occurring during the period commencing three (3) years prior to (i) the first day of the month during which a Event of Default first occurred with respect to such Leased Property or (ii) the first day of the month during which a revocation of certification for reimbursement under Medicare or Medicaid first occurred with respect to such Leased Property, whichever is earlier, and ending on the last day of the month preceding the month during which the closing occurs with respect to such Leased Property. For example, if Tenant exercises a purchase option relative to a particular Leased Property, the closing with respect thereto occurs on April 15, 2008, a Event of Default arose on January 14, 2008, such Leased Property was decertified for Medicare on July 15, 2007 and a Event of Default arose on account thereof on November 12, 2007, the period referenced above would commence on July 1, 2004 and end on March 31, 2008.

Assume further that Tenant exercises its purchase option relative to Property A and closes its purchase of Property A in strict accordance with the terms and conditions provided in this . On account of such exercise, Tenant would have exhausted its purchase option rights under such lease, and, on account of such purchase, (a) the and/or Event of Default relative to Property A would have been cured, leaving Property B as the only leased property as to which a continuing and/or Event of Default continues, and (b) because the applicable to such lease would equal 2, the continuation of a and/or Event of Default with respect to Property B and no other leased properties would not, pursuant to the terms of , be sufficient to permit Lessor to exercise termination and/or dispossession rights and remedies against any leased property other than Property B.

(cc) within sixty (60) days after the end of each calendar year, Tenant shall deliver to Lessor a Senior Officer's Certificate certifying the amount of Lessor's share of Sublease Rent Payments for the preceding calendar year and setting forth how such amount was calculated and containing a detailed breakdown of the revenues and expenses used in making such calculation, and, within thirty (30) days after Lessor's receipt of such certificate, if the aggregate amount paid by Tenant to Lessor during such preceding calendar year on account of Lessor's share of Sublease Rent Payments for such year exceeds the amount of Lessor's share as shown in such certificate, then, subject to subsection (dd) below, Lessor shall pay the overage to Tenant, and, if the aggregate amount paid by Tenant to Lessor during such preceding calendar year on account of Lessor's share of Sublease Rent Payments for such year is less than the amount of Lessor's share as shown in such certificate, Tenant shall pay such
 
deficiency to Lessor. Lessor shall be entitled, upon three (3) Business Days prior written notice and within normal business hours, to review, and make abstracts from and copies of, Tenant's books, accounts and records relative to Tenant's subleases of any Leased Property and the calculation of Lessor's share of Sublease Rent Payments for any period; and

(For example, if Tenant subleases a portion of a Leased Property, subsection (ii) above is applicable thereto, during a particular calendar year Sublease Rent Payments are received by Tenant in the aggregate amount of $100.00, and during such calendar year Tenant paid to Lessor the following monthly amounts on account of Lessor's share of Sublease Rent Payments: for each of the months January through July, $20.00 (i.e.: $140.00 in aggregate) and for each of the months August through December, $0.00, then, within thirty (30) days after Lessor's receipt of Tenant's aforesaid Senior Officer's Certificate for such calendar year, Lessor would be obligated to pay to Tenant $60.00, representing the overage of the aggregate amount received by Lessor during such calendar year ($140.00) over Lessor's share of the Sublease Rent Payments for such calendar year ($80.00 or 80% of $100.00). Alternatively, if the preceding facts are assumed except that, during the subject calendar year, the amount referenced in subsection (ii)(x) above is less than the amount referenced in subsection (ii)(y) above by $50.00, then, pursuant to subsection (dd) above, the Sublease Rent Payments for such calendar year shall be deemed to equal $0.00, and, consequently, within thirty (30) days following receipt of Tenant's aforesaid Senior Officer's Certificate for such calendar year, Lessor would be obligated to pay to Tenant $140.00, representing the overage of the aggregate amount received by Lessor during such calendar year ($140.00) over Lessor's share of the deemed Sublease Rent Payments for such calendar year ($0.00 or 80% of $0.00)).

(c) any default by such assignee or subtenant in the payment of Rent or in complying with all other covenants and obligations of the Tenant with respect to such Leased Property shall continue to constitute a default under this Lease, entitling Lessor to all its rights and remedies hereunder.

Premises
WHEREAS, Guarantor desires, and Lessor requires, that this agreement be furnished so that Guarantor, being obligated to do so, can fulfill the terms and conditions of the Lease with respect to the Premises with the same effect as if the Lease had been entered into with Guarantor as the tenant with respect to the Premises thereunder.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration and recognition of the execution of the Lease, and other good and valuable consideration and intending to be legally bound hereby, Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees, and unconditionally becomes surety to Lessor, its successors and assigns for, the payment of all rent, additional charges and other sums owing under the Lease with respect to, or allocable to, the Premises (and Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that, in the event any delinquency exists under the Lease in the payment of Base Rent, Lessor shall, for purposes of the foregoing clause, allocate such delinquency pro rata among the Leased Properties based upon the respective Transferred Property Percentages applicable to the Leased Properties) and the full, faithful and punctual performance of each and all of the covenants, agreements and conditions of the Lease to be kept and performed by Tenant with respect to the Premises, in accordance with and within the times prescribed by the Lease, as well as all other liabilities now or hereafter contracted by Tenant with Lessor pursuant to the Lease with respect to the Premises and together, to the extent the same are chargeable to Tenant under the Lease, with all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Lessor with respect to the Premises in connection with any of the foregoing and/or in connection with the enforcement of Lessor's rights against Tenant or Guarantor with respect to the Premises (all of the foregoing being hereinafter collectively referred to as the ""). In the event Tenant fails to pay, perform or observe, as applicable, any of the Liabilities, and such failure is not cured within the cure period, if any, provided to Tenant by the terms of the Lease, an Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred under this Guaranty. Guarantor agrees that it shall be obligated to keep itself informed as to the status of Tenant's payment, performance and observance of the Liabilities and that Lessor shall not be obligated to give Guarantor, and Guarantor shall not be entitled to, notice of any failure by Tenant to pay, perform or observe, as applicable, any of the Liabilities, provided, however, that Lessor agrees to accept the cure of any such failure, on or prior to the expiration of the cure period, if any, provided to Tenant by the terms of the Lease, by either Tenant or Guarantor.
Liabilities
 
Guarantor further agrees as follows:
1. Lessor shall have the right from time to time, and at any time in its sole discretion, without notice to or consent from Guarantor, and without affecting, impairing, or discharging in whole or in part, the Liabilities of Guarantor hereunder: to modify, change, extend, alter, amend or supplement in any respect whatever, any agreement or transaction between Lessor and Tenant or between Lessor and any other party liable for the Liabilities, or any portion or provision thereof; to grant extensions of time and other indulgences of any kind to Tenant; to compromise, release, substitute, exercise, enforce or fail or refuse to exercise or enforce any claims, rights or remedies of any kind which Lessor may have at any time against Tenant or any other party liable for the Liabilities, or any thereof, or with respect to any security of any kind held by Lessor at any time under any agreement or otherwise. The Liabilities of Guarantor shall not be affected, impaired or discharged, in whole or in part, by reason of payments by Tenant of all or a portion of the Liabilities, to the extent such payments shall be turned over as "voidable preferences" or otherwise required to be refunded or disgorged, or by reason of any action whatsoever taken by Lessor with respect to any security in which Lessor may at any time have any interest or against any other party liable for all or any part of the Liabilities.
2. Guarantor waives: (a) all notices, including but not limited to (i) notice of acceptance of this Guaranty, (ii) notice of presentment, demand for payment, or protest of any of the Liabilities, or the obligation of any person, firm or corporation held by Lessor as collateral security, and (iii) notice of any failure by Tenant to pay, perform or observe, as applicable, any of the Liabilities or of any Event of Default (as defined in the Lease); (b) all defenses, offsets and counterclaims which Guarantor may at any time have to any of the Liabilities, except to the extent the same is a valid defense, offset or counterclaim on the part of Tenant; and (c) all notices of the financial condition or of any adverse or other change in the financial condition of Tenant.
3. Lessor may, without notice, assign this Guaranty in whole or in part, and no assignment or transfer of the Lease or subletting of the Premises shall operate to extinguish or diminish the liability of Guarantor hereunder.
4. The liability of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be primary with respect to any right of action which shall accrue to Lessor under the Lease, and Lessor may, at its option, proceed against Guarantor without having to commence any action, or having obtained any judgment, against Tenant.
5. The Liabilities of Guarantor shall not be affected, impaired or discharged, in whole or in part, by reason of: (a) the entry of an order for relief pursuant to the United States Bankruptcy Code by or against Tenant; (b) the proposal of or the consummation of a plan of reorganization concerning Tenant; (c) the assignment of Tenant's obligations under the Lease or any other or further sublease of any portion of the Premises, whether or not any such assignment or sublease is permitted under the Lease; or (d) except by reason of actual payment and performance of Tenant's obligations under the Lease, the discharge of the obligations of Tenant to Lessor, provided, however, if Tenant, in accordance with the requirements of the Lease, assigns the Lease (including, without limitation, if and to the
 
extent permitted under Section 25.1.11 or Section 25.4 of the Lease, by virtue of a partial assignment of the Lease with respect to the Premises) to a Person (as defined in the Lease) that is not an Affiliate (as defined in the Lease) of Tenant, Tenant shall not be released from any of its duties, liabilities or obligations under the Lease on account of any such assignment, but Guarantor shall be released from this Guaranty insofar as it relates to any Liabilities of Tenant assumed by the assignee and arising on account of any breach or default of the Lease occurring after the date of such assignment.
6. The waiver of any right by Lessor or its failure to exercise promptly any right shall not be construed as the waiver of any other right including the right to exercise the same at any time thereafter. No waiver or modification of any of the terms or conditions of this Guaranty shall be binding against Lessor unless such waiver or modification is in a writing signed by Lessor.
7. The liability of Guarantor shall bind the respective representatives, successors and assigns of Guarantor and shall inure to the benefit of Lessor, its successors and assigns.
8. This Guaranty shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without reference to the choice of law principles thereof. Guarantor hereby agrees to submit to the jurisdiction of any court of general jurisdiction sitting in the State of New York and designates any officer or supervisory employee of Lessor located at the Premises as its agent and attorney in fact for the purpose of accepting service and making an appearance on its behalf in such proceeding and taking all such acts as may be necessary or appropriate in order to confer jurisdiction on it upon such court, provided such agent and attorney in fact shall promptly send a true copy of all materials so served to Guarantor at the address and in the manner specified in Section 9 below, and Guarantor stipulates that such consent and appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest.
9. All notices, demands, requests, consents, approvals and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and delivered or mailed (by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or reputable nationally recognized overnight courier service and postage prepaid), addressed to the respective parties, as follows:

Section 7.2.8
With reference to and hereof, Lessor agrees that Tenant's rights to convert licensed beds on the terms set forth in hereof and/or voluntary remove from service or delicense beds on the terms set forth in hereof do not replace Tenant's rights to delicense beds as and to the extent permitted by hereof. For example, assume that a particular SN Facility had 100 licensed beds as of the Commencement Date, that, for purposes of this example, at all times the Permissible Reduction Percentage applicable to such Facility is 10% (so that, pursuant to hereof, a reduction in the number of licensed beds to 90 beds would not cause a default under ), that such SN Facility is not listed on hereof and that the minimum number of non-banked skilled nursing care beds that is required at such SN Facility as set forth on is 95 beds. If, in accordance with the terms of hereof, the number of licensed beds at such SN Facility is reduced to 95 beds, neither nor hereof would prohibit Tenant, pursuant to hereof, from thereafter allowing an additional 5 beds to be delicensed. On the other hand, if Tenant first allowed 5 beds to be delicensed pursuant to hereof, Tenant could not thereafter proceed under hereof if such proceeding would result in the loss of licensure of any bed, as 95 beds is the minimum as described above (but Tenant could still allow the number of beds to be further reduced from 95 beds to 90 beds pursuant to , without causing a default under such ).

subtracting from the number of licensed beds at such Facility as of such date the number of licensed beds set forth in the "95% of Minimum" column of as it applies to such Facility and then dividing the result of such subtraction by the number of licensed beds at such Facility as of such date. (For example, if Tenant voluntarily removes from service, in accordance with the requirements of subsection (m)(i)(3) above, fifteen percent (15%) or less of the aforesaid licensed beds at a particular Facility as to which neither subsection (m)(ii)(x) nor (m)(ii)(y) nor (m)(ii)(z) above applies, the "Permissible Reduction Percentage" would equal ten percent (10%) for such Facility, but if, for example, Tenant voluntarily removes from service, in accordance with the requirements of subsection (m)(i)(3) above, twenty percent (20%) of the aforesaid licensed beds at such Facility, the "Permissible Reduction Percentage" applicable to such Facility would equal five percent (5%) (i.e., under subsection (m)(ii)(2) above, 25%-20%=5%). Also, for example, if a particular Facility listed on had, as of the Commencement Date, 120 licensed beds, such Facility had not lost any licensed beds other than 38 licensed beds lost through an involuntary reduction that complies with subsection (m)(iii) below (so that, as of a particular date, such Facility has 82 licensed beds), and sets forth 80 licensed beds in the "Minimum Number of Licensed Beds" column as it applies to such Facility and 76 licensed beds in the "95% of Minimum" column as it applies to such Facility, the percentage referenced in the foregoing subsection (m)(ii)(z) would equal 7.317% (82 licensed beds minus 76 licensed beds equals 6 licensed beds and 6 licensed beds divided by 82 licensed beds equals 7.317%, which is greater than the 5.0% referenced in subsection (m)(ii)(z)(A) above); and

. It is the intention of this to set forth specific provisions that, in limited circumstances, for a limited number of times and only in connection with the occurrence of Events of Default under and/or of this Lease, allow Tenant a non-renewing right to purchase a Leased Property(ies) and thereby to reduce the number of Leased Properties as to which and/or Events of Default continue to exist to below the applicable , and, by doing so strictly on the terms and conditions provided in this , thereby to avoid the exercise by Lessor of termination and/or dispossession rights and remedies against all Leased Properties covered hereby on account of such and/or Event(s) of Default. Tenant's purchase rights as set forth in this are not applicable to any other Events of Default or in any other circumstances and are strictly limited in number and non-renewing.

At such closing, Lessor will, by special warranty deed (or, if a particular Leased Property is subject to an Existing Ground Lease, by a special warranty assignment, rather than a special warranty deed), convey to Tenant or its designee all of Lessor's right, title and interest in the subject Leased Property(ies) (or, if a particular Leased Property is subject to an Existing Ground Lease, in the subject Existing Ground Lease), subject to the Permitted Encumbrances, and will cause to be released any Facility Mortgage(s) or other liens created by Lessor or its agents or employees relative to the subject Leased Property(ies) (and, if Lessor is unable to cause such release(s) as of the initially scheduled closing date, the closing date shall be extended as necessary to allow Lessor additional time to cause such release(s)), and Tenant will pay in cash, to or as directed by Lessor, the purchase price therefor, as described in below, subject, if applicable as described below, to a credit against the purchase price in favor of Tenant and in the amount, if any, described below.

At such closing, Tenant shall execute and deliver to Lessor an instrument pursuant to which Tenant shall represent and warrant to, and covenant with, Lessor that (a) Tenant is purchasing the subject Leased Property(ies) with the intention of selling the same and

Assume further that Tenant exercises its purchase option relative to Property A and closes its purchase of Property A in strict accordance with the terms and conditions provided in this . On account of such exercise, Tenant would have exhausted its purchase option rights under such lease, and, on account of such purchase, (a) the and/or Event of Default relative to Property A would have been cured, leaving Property B as the only leased property as to which a continuing and/or Event of Default continues, and (b) because the applicable to such lease would equal 2, the continuation of a and/or Event of Default with respect to Property B and no other leased properties would not, pursuant to the terms of , be sufficient to permit Lessor to exercise termination and/or dispossession rights and remedies against any leased property other than Property B.

payment or portion thereof provided such Leasehold Mortgagee shall have made demand therefor not later than one year after the date of its payment.
. Lessor acknowledges that each of the Leased Properties is covered, and may in the future be covered, by a separate Leasehold Mortgage and that, due to the fact that the applicable law of each jurisdiction differs as to the procedures (including, without limitation, the periods for notices of sale to be published) for the exercise by a Leasehold Mortgagee of remedies under a Leasehold Mortgage and that certain of the Leasehold Mortgages may be of Leased Properties located in jurisdictions that are subject to anti-deficiency judgment, election of remedies and/or one-form-of-action statutes making it advisable for a Leasehold Mortgagee to exercise remedies with respect to such Leased Properties in a certain order, the Leasehold Mortgagee may be required under applicable law to, or due to applicable remedial limitations including those described above, may reasonably elect to exercise remedies against less than all of the Leased Properties at a particular time and/or may elect, or may be required by applicable law, to exercise remedies against the Leased Properties in a particular order. Therefore, Lessor agrees that its obligations under this are applicable to each Leased Property. For example, Lessor may be asked to enter into a Separate Lease with respect to less than all of the Leased Properties pursuant to and/or Lessor may be asked to approve a proposed transferee of a particular Leased Property pursuant to .

Any amounts which become payable by Tenant under this Section shall be paid within ten (10) days after liability therefor on the part of Tenant is determined by litigation or otherwise, and if not timely paid, shall bear interest (to the extent permitted by law) at the Overdue Rate from the date of such determination to the date of payment. Tenant, at its expense, shall contest, resist and defend any such claim, action or proceeding asserted or instituted against Lessor or may compromise or otherwise dispose of the same as Tenant sees fit. Nothing herein shall be construed as indemnifying Lessor against its own negligent acts or omissions or willful misconduct. If at any time Lessor shall have notice of a claim, Lessor shall give reasonably prompt written notice of such claim to Tenant; (i) Lessor shall have no liability for a failure to give notice of any claim of which Tenant has otherwise been notified or has knowledge and (ii) the failure of Lessor to give such a notice to Tenant shall not limit the rights of Lessor or the obligations of Tenant with respect to such claim except to the extent that Tenant incurs actual expenses or suffers actual monetary loss as a result of such failure. Tenant shall have the right to control the defense or settlement of any claim, provided that (A) Tenant shall first confirm in writing to Lessor that such claim is within the scope of this indemnity and that Tenant shall pay any and all amounts required to be paid in respect of such claim and (B) if the compromise or settlement of any such claim shall not result in the complete release of Lessor from the claim so compromised or settled, the compromise or settlement shall require the prior written approval of Lessor. Lessor shall have the right to approve counsel engaged to defend such claim and, at its election and sole cost and expense, shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in the defense of any claim.

Lessor shall indemnify, save harmless and defend Tenant from and against all liabilities, obligations, claims, damages, penalties, causes of action, costs and expenses imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against Tenant as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lessor under and in connection with this Lease.
Tenant's and Lessor's respective duties, liabilities and obligations under this Article shall survive the expiration or termination of this Lease as to any or all of the Leased Properties. For example, if (x) John Doe is injured in a slip-and-fall accident that occurs at Leased Property A on January 1, 2008 and of which Lessor has no notice or knowledge, (y) this Lease terminates for any reason on March 1, 2008 with respect to Leased Property A, and (z) on July 1, 2008, John Doe begins a lawsuit against Lessor on account of the aforesaid accident, then, notwithstanding such termination, Tenant's indemnification and other obligations with respect to such accident and lawsuit under subsection (a) above and the other provisions of this Article shall survive such termination with respect to Leased Property A.
. To the extent, if at all, that N.M. Stat. Ann.  56-7-1 is applicable to any agreement to indemnify in this Lease, or any related documents, such an agreement to indemnify will not extend to liability, claims, damages, losses or expenses,

preceding calendar year on account of Lessor's share of Sublease Rent Payments for such year exceeds the amount of Lessor's share as shown in such certificate, then, subject to subsection (dd) below, Lessor shall pay the overage to Tenant, and, if the aggregate amount paid by Tenant to Lessor during such preceding calendar year on account of Lessor's share of Sublease Rent Payments for such year is less than the amount of Lessor's share as shown in such certificate, Tenant shall pay such deficiency to Lessor. Lessor shall be entitled, upon three (3) Business Days prior written notice and within normal business hours, to review, and make abstracts from and copies of, Tenant's books, accounts and records relative to Tenant's subleases of any Leased Property and the calculation of Lessor's share of Sublease Rent Payments for any period; and

(For example, if Tenant subleases a portion of a Leased Property, subsection (ii) above is applicable thereto, during a particular calendar year Sublease Rent Payments are received by Tenant in the aggregate amount of $100.00, and during such calendar year Tenant paid to Lessor the following monthly amounts on account of Lessor's share of Sublease Rent Payments: for each of the months January through July, $20.00 (i.e.: $140.00 in aggregate) and for each of the months August through December, $0.00, then, within thirty (30) days after Lessor's receipt of Tenant's aforesaid Senior Officer's Certificate for such calendar year, Lessor would be obligated to pay to Tenant $60.00, representing the overage of the aggregate amount received by Lessor during such calendar year ($140.00) over Lessor's share of the Sublease Rent Payments for such calendar year ($80.00 or 80% of $100.00). Alternatively, if the preceding facts are assumed except that, during the subject calendar year, the amount referenced in subsection (ii)(x) above is less than the amount referenced in subsection (ii)(y) above by $50.00, then, pursuant to subsection (dd) above, the Sublease Rent Payments for such calendar year shall be deemed to equal $0.00, and, consequently, within thirty (30) days following receipt of Tenant's aforesaid Senior Officer's Certificate for such calendar year, Lessor would be obligated to pay to Tenant $140.00, representing the overage of the aggregate amount received by Lessor during such calendar year ($140.00) over Lessor's share of the deemed Sublease Rent Payments for such calendar year ($0.00 or 80% of $0.00)).

(c) any default by such assignee or subtenant in the payment of Rent or in complying with all other covenants and obligations of the Tenant with respect to such Leased Property shall continue to constitute a default under this Lease, entitling Lessor to all its rights and remedies hereunder.

With reference to and hereof, Lessor agrees that Tenant's rights to convert licensed beds on the terms set forth in hereof and/or voluntary remove from service or delicense beds on the terms set forth in hereof do not replace Tenant's rights to delicense beds as and to the extent permitted by hereof. For example, assume that a particular SN Facility had 100 licensed beds as of the Commencement Date, that, for purposes of this example, at all times the Permissible Reduction Percentage applicable to such Facility is 10% (so that, pursuant to hereof, a reduction in the number of licensed beds to 90 beds would not cause a default under ), that such SN Facility is not listed on hereof and that the minimum number of non-banked skilled nursing care beds that is required at such SN Facility as set forth on is 95 beds. If, in accordance with the terms of hereof, the number of licensed beds at such SN Facility is reduced to 95 beds, neither nor hereof would prohibit Tenant, pursuant to hereof, from thereafter allowing an additional 5 beds to be delicensed. On the other hand, if Tenant first allowed 5 beds to be delicensed pursuant to hereof, Tenant could not thereafter proceed under hereof if such proceeding would result in

Assume further that, pursuant to of such lease, a Separate Lease under is entered into with a leasehold mortgagee or its designee relative to Property A. Assume further that several months later a Event of Default arises relative to Property A. As a result of , the Event of Default relative to Property A will also be considered an Event of Default under of the aforesaid remaining lease of 14 Master Lease Leased Properties and Property A will, for all purposes of and of such remaining lease, be counted as a leased property as to which a Event of Default had occurred and was continuing the same as if a Event of Default had occurred and was continuing under such remaining lease relative to a Master Lease Leased Property included in such remaining lease.

As a result of , the Event of Default relative to Property A will also be considered an Event of Default under of both the remaining lease of 14 Master Lease Leased Properties and the aforesaid 45 Master Lease Leased Properties lease and Property A will, for all purposes of and of such remaining lease and such 45 Master Lease Leased Properties lease, be counted as a leased property as to which a Event of Default had occurred and was continuing the same as if a Event of Default had occurred and was continuing under such remaining lease relative to a Master Lease Leased Property included therein and under such 45 Master Lease Leased Properties lease relative to a Master Lease Leased Property included therein. This is because, several months prior to the creation of the Separate Lease, Property A was included in the aforesaid 60 Master Lease Leased Properties lease and both the 14 Master Lease Leased Properties lease and the 45 Master Lease Leased Properties lease derive from such 60 Master Lease Leased Properties lease.

On account of such exercise, Tenant would have exhausted its purchase option rights under such lease, and, on account of such purchase, (a) the and/or Event of Default relative to Property A would have been cured, leaving Property B as the only leased property as to which a continuing and/or Event of Default continues, and (b) because the applicable to such lease would equal 2, the continuation of a and/or Event of Default with respect to Property B and no other leased properties would not, pursuant to the terms of , be sufficient to permit Lessor to exercise termination and/or dispossession rights and remedies against any leased property other than Property B.

Erroneous Payments
. Lessor acknowledges that each of the Leased Properties is covered, and may in the future be covered, by a separate Leasehold Mortgage and that, due to the fact that the applicable law of each jurisdiction differs as to the procedures (including, without limitation, the periods for notices of sale to be published) for the exercise by a Leasehold Mortgagee of remedies under a Leasehold Mortgage and that certain of the Leasehold Mortgages may be of Leased Properties located in jurisdictions that are subject to anti-deficiency judgment, election of remedies and/or one-form-of-action statutes making it advisable for a Leasehold Mortgagee to exercise remedies with respect to such Leased Properties in a certain order, the Leasehold Mortgagee may be required under applicable law to, or due to applicable remedial limitations including those described above, may reasonably elect to exercise remedies against less than all of the Leased Properties at a particular time and/or may elect, or may be required by applicable law, to exercise remedies against the Leased Properties in a particular order.

Nothing herein shall be construed as indemnifying Lessor against its own negligent acts or omissions or willful misconduct. If at any time Lessor shall have notice of a claim, Lessor shall give reasonably prompt written notice of such claim to Tenant; (i) Lessor shall have no liability for a failure to give notice of any claim of which Tenant has otherwise been notified or has knowledge and (ii) the failure of Lessor to give such a notice to Tenant shall not limit the rights of Lessor or the obligations of Tenant with respect to such claim except to the extent that Tenant incurs actual expenses or suffers actual monetary loss as a result of such failure.

(For example, if Tenant subleases a portion of a Leased Property, subsection (ii) above is applicable thereto, during a particular calendar year Sublease Rent Payments are received by Tenant in the aggregate amount of $100.00, and during such calendar year Tenant paid to Lessor the following monthly amounts on account of Lessor's share of Sublease Rent Payments: for each of the months January through July, $20.00 (i.e.: $140.00 in aggregate) and for each of the months August through December, $0.00, then, within thirty (30) days after Lessor's receipt of Tenant's aforesaid Senior Officer's Certificate for such calendar year, Lessor would be obligated to pay to Tenant $60.00, representing the overage of the aggregate amount received by Lessor during such calendar year ($140.00) over Lessor's share of the Sublease Rent Payments for such calendar year ($80.00 or 80% of $100.00). Alternatively, if the preceding facts are assumed except that, during the subject calendar year, the amount referenced in subsection (ii)(x) above is less than the amount
Section 25.1.7
Section 25.1.7
 
referenced in subsection (ii)(y) above by $50.00, then, pursuant to subsection (dd) above, the Sublease Rent Payments for such calendar year shall be deemed to equal $0.00, and, consequently, within thirty (30) days following receipt of Tenant's aforesaid Senior Officer's Certificate for such calendar year, Lessor would be obligated to pay to Tenant $140.00, representing the overage of the aggregate amount received by Lessor during such calendar year ($140.00) over Lessor's share of the deemed Sublease Rent Payments for such calendar year ($0.00 or 80% of $0.00)).
In the event of a foreclosure by a Leasehold Mortgagee as to a particular Leased Property(ies), Lessor's right to 80% (50%, in the circumstances described above relative to the existing subleases scheduled on hereof) of such Sublease Rent Payments relating to such Leased Property(ies) shall be subordinate to such Leasehold Mortgagee's right of payment. In the event of an assignment or sublet pursuant to hereof, the provisions of this shall apply to any further assignment or sublet to a person or entity that is not an Affiliate of Tenant.

Any assignment of this Lease or sublease of the applicable Leased Property in contravention of the express terms of this shall be voidable at Lessor's option and the acceptance of rent by Lessor from any such unauthorized assignee or subtenant shall not constitute a recognition or acceptance of the tenancy of such unauthorized assignee or subtenant.

long as such assignee or subtenant pays Rent allocable to such Leased Property and otherwise complies with all covenants and obligations of the Tenant under this Lease with respect to such Leased Property, no other default under this Lease shall affect or give rise to any right to terminate its leasehold of such Leased Property; and
(c) any default by such assignee or subtenant in the payment of Rent or in complying with all other covenants and obligations of the Tenant with respect to such Leased Property shall continue to constitute a default under this Lease, entitling Lessor to all its rights and remedies hereunder.

Premises
WHEREAS, Guarantor desires, and Lessor requires, that this agreement be furnished so that Guarantor, being obligated to do so, can fulfill the terms and conditions of the Lease with respect to the Premises with the same effect as if the Lease had been entered into with Guarantor as the tenant with respect to the Premises thereunder.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration and recognition of the execution of the Lease, and other good and valuable consideration and intending to be legally bound hereby, Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees, and unconditionally becomes surety to Lessor, its successors and assigns for, the payment of all rent, additional charges and other sums owing under the Lease with respect to, or allocable to, the Premises (and Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that, in the event any delinquency exists under the Lease in the payment of Base Rent, Lessor shall, for purposes of the foregoing clause, allocate such delinquency pro rata among the Leased Properties based upon the respective Transferred Property Percentages applicable to the Leased Properties) and the full, faithful and punctual performance of each and all of the covenants, agreements and conditions of the Lease to be kept and performed by Tenant with respect to the Premises, in accordance with and within the times prescribed by the Lease, as well as all other liabilities now or hereafter contracted by Tenant with Lessor pursuant to the Lease with respect to the Premises and together, to the extent the same are chargeable to Tenant under the Lease, with all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Lessor with respect to the Premises in connection with any of the foregoing and/or in connection with the enforcement of Lessor's rights against Tenant or Guarantor with respect to the Premises (all of the foregoing being hereinafter collectively referred to as the ""). In the event Tenant fails to pay, perform or observe, as applicable, any of the Liabilities, and such failure is not cured within the cure period, if any, provided to Tenant by the terms of the Lease, an Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred under this Guaranty. Guarantor agrees that it shall be obligated to keep itself informed as to the status of Tenant's payment, performance and observance of the Liabilities and that Lessor shall not be obligated to give Guarantor, and Guarantor shall not be entitled to, notice of any failure by Tenant to pay, perform or observe, as applicable, any of the Liabilities, provided, however, that Lessor agrees to accept the cure of any such failure, on or prior to the expiration of the cure period, if any, provided to Tenant by the terms of the Lease, by either Tenant or Guarantor.
Liabilities
 
Guarantor further agrees as follows:
1. Lessor shall have the right from time to time, and at any time in its sole discretion, without notice to or consent from Guarantor, and without affecting, impairing, or discharging in whole or in part, the Liabilities of Guarantor hereunder: to modify, change, extend, alter, amend or supplement in any respect whatever, any agreement or transaction between Lessor and Tenant or between Lessor and any other party liable for the Liabilities, or any portion or provision thereof; to grant extensions of time and other indulgences of any kind to Tenant; to compromise, release, substitute, exercise, enforce or fail or refuse to exercise or enforce any claims, rights or remedies of any kind which Lessor may have at any time against Tenant or any other party liable for the Liabilities, or any thereof, or with respect to any security of any kind held by Lessor at any time under any agreement or otherwise. The Liabilities of Guarantor shall not be affected, impaired or discharged, in whole or in part, by reason of payments by Tenant of all or a portion of the Liabilities, to the extent such payments shall be turned over as "voidable preferences" or otherwise required to be refunded or disgorged, or by reason of any action whatsoever taken by Lessor with respect to any security in which Lessor may at any time have any interest or against any other party liable for all or any part of the Liabilities.
2. Guarantor waives: (a) all notices, including but not limited to (i) notice of acceptance of this Guaranty, (ii) notice of presentment, demand for payment, or protest of any of the Liabilities, or the obligation of any person, firm or corporation held by Lessor as collateral security, and (iii) notice of any failure by Tenant to pay, perform or observe, as applicable, any of the Liabilities or of any Event of Default (as defined in the Lease); (b) all defenses, offsets and counterclaims which Guarantor may at any time have to any of the Liabilities, except to the extent the same is a valid defense, offset or counterclaim on the part of Tenant; and (c) all notices of the financial condition or of any adverse or other change in the financial condition of Tenant.
3. Lessor may, without notice, assign this Guaranty in whole or in part, and no assignment or transfer of the Lease or subletting of the Premises shall operate to extinguish or diminish the liability of Guarantor hereunder.
4. The liability of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be primary with respect to any right of action which shall accrue to Lessor under the Lease, and Lessor may, at its option, proceed against Guarantor without having to commence any action, or having obtained any judgment, against Tenant.

6. The waiver of any right by Lessor or its failure to exercise promptly any right shall not be construed as the waiver of any other right including the right to exercise the same at any time thereafter. No waiver or modification of any of the terms or conditions of this Guaranty shall be binding against Lessor unless such waiver or modification is in a writing signed by Lessor.
7. The liability of Guarantor shall bind the respective representatives, successors and assigns of Guarantor and shall inure to the benefit of Lessor, its successors and assigns.
8. This Guaranty shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without reference to the choice of law principles thereof. Guarantor hereby agrees to submit to the jurisdiction of any court of general jurisdiction sitting in the State of New York and designates any officer or supervisory employee of Lessor located at the Premises as its agent and attorney in fact for the purpose of accepting service and making an appearance on its behalf in such proceeding and taking all such acts as may be necessary or appropriate in order to confer jurisdiction on it upon such court, provided such agent and attorney in fact shall promptly send a true copy of all materials so served to Guarantor at the address and in the manner specified in Section 9 below, and Guarantor stipulates that such consent and appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest.

With reference to and hereof, Lessor agrees that Tenant's rights to convert licensed beds on the terms set forth in hereof and/or voluntary remove from service or delicense beds on the terms set forth in hereof do not replace Tenant's rights to delicense beds as and to the extent permitted by hereof. For example, assume that a particular SN Facility had 100 licensed beds as of the Commencement Date, that, for purposes of this example, at all times the Permissible Reduction Percentage applicable to such Facility is 10% (so that, pursuant to hereof, a reduction in the number of licensed beds to 90 beds would not cause a default under ), that such SN Facility is not listed on hereof and that the minimum number of non-banked skilled nursing care beds that is required at such SN Facility as set forth on is 95 beds. If, in accordance with the terms of hereof, the number of licensed beds at such SN Facility is reduced to 95 beds, neither nor hereof would prohibit Tenant, pursuant to hereof, from thereafter allowing an additional 5 beds to be delicensed.

subtracting from the number of licensed beds at such Facility as of such date the number of licensed beds set forth in the "95% of Minimum" column of as it applies to such Facility and then dividing the result of such subtraction by the number of licensed beds at such Facility as of such date. (For example, if Tenant voluntarily removes from service, in accordance with the requirements of subsection (m)(i)(3) above, fifteen percent (15%) or less of the aforesaid licensed beds at a particular Facility as to which neither subsection (m)(ii)(x) nor (m)(ii)(y) nor (m)(ii)(z) above applies, the "Permissible Reduction Percentage" would equal ten percent (10%) for such Facility, but if, for example, Tenant voluntarily removes from service, in accordance with the requirements of subsection (m)(i)(3) above, twenty percent (20%) of the aforesaid licensed beds at such Facility, the "Permissible Reduction Percentage" applicable to such Facility would equal five percent (5%) (i.e., under subsection (m)(ii)(2) above, 25%-20%=5%). Also, for example, if a particular Facility listed on had, as of the Commencement Date, 120 licensed beds, such Facility had not lost any licensed beds other than 38 licensed beds lost through an involuntary reduction that complies with subsection (m)(iii) below (so that, as of a particular date, such Facility has 82 licensed beds), and sets forth 80 licensed beds in the "Minimum Number of Licensed Beds" column as it applies to such Facility and 76 licensed beds in the "95% of Minimum" column as it applies to such Facility, the percentage referenced in the foregoing subsection (m)(ii)(z) would equal 7.317% (82 licensed beds minus 76 licensed beds equals 6 licensed beds and 6 licensed beds divided by 82 licensed beds equals 7.317%, which is greater than the 5.0% referenced in subsection (m)(ii)(z)(A) above); and

Assume further that Tenant exercises its purchase option relative to Property A and closes its purchase of Property A in strict accordance with the terms and conditions provided in this . On account of such exercise, Tenant would have exhausted its purchase option rights under such lease, and, on account of such purchase, (a) the and/or Event of Default relative to Property A would have been cured, leaving Property B as the only leased property as to which a continuing and/or Event of Default continues, and (b) because the applicable to such lease would equal 2, the continuation of a and/or Event of Default with respect to Property B and no other leased properties would not, pursuant to the terms of , be sufficient to permit Lessor to exercise termination and/or dispossession rights and remedies against any leased property other than Property B.

Erroneous Payments
 
. Lessor acknowledges that each of the Leased Properties is covered, and may in the future be covered, by a separate Leasehold Mortgage and that, due to the fact that the applicable law of each jurisdiction differs as to the procedures (including, without limitation, the periods for notices of sale to be published) for the exercise by a Leasehold Mortgagee of remedies under a Leasehold Mortgage and that certain of the Leasehold Mortgages may be of Leased Properties located in jurisdictions that are subject to anti-deficiency judgment, election of remedies and/or one-form-of-action statutes making it advisable for a Leasehold Mortgagee to exercise remedies with respect to such Leased Properties in a certain order, the Leasehold Mortgagee may be required under applicable law to, or due to applicable remedial limitations including those described above, may reasonably elect to exercise remedies against less than all of the Leased Properties at a particular time and/or may elect, or may be required by applicable law, to exercise remedies against the Leased Properties in a particular order. Therefore, Lessor agrees that its obligations under this are applicable to each Leased Property. For example, Lessor may be asked to enter into a Separate Lease with respect to less than all of the Leased Properties pursuant to and/or Lessor may be asked to approve a proposed transferee of a particular Leased Property pursuant to .

Any amounts which become payable by Tenant under this Section shall be paid within ten (10) days after liability therefor on the part of Tenant is determined by litigation or otherwise, and if not timely paid, shall bear interest (to the extent permitted by law) at the Overdue Rate from the date of such determination to the date of payment. Tenant, at its expense, shall contest, resist and defend any such claim, action or proceeding asserted or instituted against Lessor or may compromise or otherwise dispose of the same as Tenant sees fit. Nothing herein shall be construed as indemnifying Lessor against its own negligent acts or omissions or willful misconduct. If at any time Lessor shall have notice of a claim, Lessor shall give reasonably prompt written notice of such claim to Tenant; (i) Lessor shall have no liability for a failure to give notice of any claim of which Tenant has otherwise been notified or has knowledge and (ii) the failure of Lessor to give such a notice to Tenant shall not limit the rights of Lessor or the obligations of Tenant with respect to such claim except to the extent that Tenant incurs actual expenses or suffers actual monetary loss as a result of such failure. Tenant shall have the right to control the defense or settlement of any claim, provided that (A) Tenant shall first confirm in writing to Lessor that such claim is within the scope of this indemnity and that Tenant shall pay any and all amounts required to be paid in respect of such claim and (B) if the compromise or settlement of any such claim shall not result in the complete release of Lessor from the claim so compromised or settled, the compromise or settlement shall require the prior written approval of Lessor. Lessor shall have the right to approve counsel engaged to defend such claim and, at its election and sole cost and expense, shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in the defense of any claim.

Tenant's and Lessor's respective duties, liabilities and obligations under this Article shall survive the expiration or termination of this Lease as to any or all of the Leased Properties.

(with such share to be equal to (A) if the applicable sublease relates primarily to use of areas within the Facility(ies) located on the applicable Leased Property, the product of the total of the aforesaid Base Rent, real estate taxes and assessments, insurance premiums and utility usage charges owing with respect, or allocable, to the applicable Leased Property for a particular month times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of rentable square feet under the applicable sublease and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of rentable square feet in the Facility(ies) located on the applicable Leased Property, and (B) if the applicable sublease relates primarily to use of areas outside the Facility(ies) located on the applicable Leased Property, that portion of the aforesaid real estate taxes, insurance premiums and charges for utility usage as are, in the reasonable judgment of Tenant (and with supporting documentation to be delivered to Lessor upon written request), attributable to the areas outside the Facility(ies) located on the applicable Leased Property), plus (2) the amount (amortized, if applicable, as described below) of the actual out of pocket costs, if any, incurred by Tenant (on behalf of itself and, to the extent related to "Sublease Rent Payments" (as defined below), on behalf of Lessor's 80% (or 50%, if applicable as described above) share thereof) from time to time during the applicable sublease and directly attributable to (aa) extending telephone service to the portion of the applicable Leased Property that is subleased per the applicable sublease or (bb) performing repairs to the portion of the applicable Leased Property that is subleased per the applicable sublease (and, for purposes of this subsection (2) and the calculation of "Sublease Rent Payments", as hereinafter defined, (X) in the case of any costs of the nature referenced in this subsection (2) that, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, are treated as capital costs, such costs shall be amortized on a straight line basis over the longer of the useful life of the improvements or repairs to which such costs relate or the initial term of the applicable sublease, and in each month the amortized amount of such costs shall be deemed to have been incurred by Tenant, and (Y) in the case of all other costs of the nature referenced in this subsection (2), such costs shall be treated as incurred by Tenant as and when expended),

preceding calendar year on account of Lessor's share of Sublease Rent Payments for such year exceeds the amount of Lessor's share as shown in such certificate, then, subject to subsection (dd) below, Lessor shall pay the overage to Tenant, and, if the aggregate amount paid by Tenant to Lessor during such preceding calendar year on account of Lessor's share of Sublease Rent Payments for such year is less than the amount of Lessor's share as shown in such certificate, Tenant shall pay such deficiency to Lessor. Lessor shall be entitled, upon three (3) Business Days prior written notice and within normal business hours, to review, and make abstracts from and copies of, Tenant's books, accounts and records relative to Tenant's subleases of any Leased Property and the calculation of Lessor's share of Sublease Rent Payments for any period; and

(For example, if Tenant subleases a portion of a Leased Property, subsection (ii) above is applicable thereto, during a particular calendar year Sublease Rent Payments are received by Tenant in the aggregate amount of $100.00, and during such calendar year Tenant paid to Lessor the following monthly amounts on account of Lessor's share of Sublease Rent Payments: for each of the months January through July, $20.00 (i.e.: $140.00 in aggregate) and for each of the months August through December, $0.00, then, within thirty (30) days after Lessor's receipt of Tenant's aforesaid Senior Officer's Certificate for such calendar year, Lessor would be obligated to pay to Tenant $60.00, representing the overage of the aggregate amount received by Lessor during such calendar year ($140.00) over Lessor's share of the Sublease Rent Payments for such calendar year ($80.00 or 80% of $100.00). Alternatively, if the preceding facts are assumed except that, during the subject calendar year, the amount referenced in subsection (ii)(x) above is less than the amount referenced in subsection (ii)(y) above by $50.00, then, pursuant to subsection (dd) above, the Sublease Rent Payments for such calendar year shall be deemed to equal $0.00, and, consequently, within thirty (30) days following receipt of Tenant's aforesaid Senior Officer's Certificate for such calendar year, Lessor would be obligated to pay to Tenant $140.00, representing the overage of the aggregate amount received by Lessor during such calendar year ($140.00) over Lessor's share of the deemed Sublease Rent Payments for such calendar year ($0.00 or 80% of $0.00)).

Any assignment of this Lease or sublease of the applicable Leased Property in contravention of the express terms of this shall be voidable at Lessor's option and the acceptance of rent by Lessor from any such unauthorized assignee or subtenant shall not constitute a recognition or acceptance of the tenancy of such unauthorized assignee or subtenant.

(c) any default by such assignee or subtenant in the payment of Rent or in complying with all other covenants and obligations of the Tenant with respect to such Leased Property shall continue to constitute a default under this Lease, entitling Lessor to all its rights and remedies hereunder.
To the extent that any of the Master Lease Leased Properties are the subject of a New Lease derived, directly or indirectly, from the Second Amended and Restated Lease, Tenant shall
 
continue to have the right to assign or sublet such Master Lease Leased Properties upon compliance with this or the corresponding section of such New Lease, as applicable, but such right to assign or sublet, whether under of the Second Amended and Restated Lease or the corresponding section of any and all New Leases derived, directly or indirectly, from the Second Amended and Restated Lease, shall never exceed ten percent (10%) in the aggregate of the nursing centers included within the Master Lease Leased Properties or two (2) hospitals included within the Master Lease Leased Properties.

Premises
WHEREAS, Guarantor desires, and Lessor requires, that this agreement be furnished so that Guarantor, being obligated to do so, can fulfill the terms and conditions of the Lease with respect to the Premises with the same effect as if the Lease had been entered into with Guarantor as the tenant with respect to the Premises thereunder.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration and recognition of the execution of the Lease, and other good and valuable consideration and intending to be legally bound hereby, Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees, and unconditionally becomes surety to Lessor, its successors and assigns for, the payment of all rent, additional charges and other sums owing under the Lease with respect to, or allocable to, the Premises (and Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that, in the event any delinquency exists under the Lease in the payment of Base Rent, Lessor shall, for purposes of the foregoing clause, allocate such delinquency pro rata among the Leased Properties based upon the respective Transferred Property Percentages applicable to the Leased Properties) and the full, faithful and punctual performance of each and all of the covenants, agreements and conditions of the Lease to be kept and performed by Tenant with respect to the Premises, in accordance with and within the times prescribed by the Lease, as well as all other liabilities now or hereafter contracted by Tenant with Lessor pursuant to the Lease with respect to the Premises and together, to the extent the same are chargeable to Tenant under the Lease, with all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Lessor with respect to the Premises in connection with any of the foregoing and/or in connection with the enforcement of Lessor's rights against Tenant or Guarantor with respect to the Premises (all of the foregoing being hereinafter collectively referred to as the ""). In the event Tenant fails to pay, perform or observe, as applicable, any of the Liabilities, and such failure is not cured within the cure period, if any, provided to Tenant by the terms of the Lease, an Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred under this Guaranty. Guarantor agrees that it shall be obligated to keep itself informed as to the status of Tenant's payment, performance and observance of the Liabilities and that Lessor shall not be obligated to give Guarantor, and Guarantor shall not be entitled to, notice of any failure by Tenant to pay, perform or observe, as applicable, any of the Liabilities, provided, however, that Lessor agrees to accept the cure of any such failure, on or prior to the expiration of the cure period, if any, provided to Tenant by the terms of the Lease, by either Tenant or Guarantor.
Liabilities
 
Guarantor further agrees as follows:
1. Lessor shall have the right from time to time, and at any time in its sole discretion, without notice to or consent from Guarantor, and without affecting, impairing, or discharging in whole or in part, the Liabilities of Guarantor hereunder: to modify, change, extend, alter, amend or supplement in any respect whatever, any agreement or transaction between Lessor and Tenant or between Lessor and any other party liable for the Liabilities, or any portion or provision thereof; to grant extensions of time and other indulgences of any kind to Tenant; to compromise, release, substitute, exercise, enforce or fail or refuse to exercise or enforce any claims, rights or remedies of any kind which Lessor may have at any time against Tenant or any other party liable for the Liabilities, or any thereof, or with respect to any security of any kind held by Lessor at any time under any agreement or otherwise. The Liabilities of Guarantor shall not be affected, impaired or discharged, in whole or in part, by reason of payments by Tenant of all or a portion of the Liabilities, to the extent such payments shall be turned over as "voidable preferences" or otherwise required to be refunded or disgorged, or by reason of any action whatsoever taken by Lessor with respect to any security in which Lessor may at any time have any interest or against any other party liable for all or any part of the Liabilities.
2. Guarantor waives: (a) all notices, including but not limited to (i) notice of acceptance of this Guaranty, (ii) notice of presentment, demand for payment, or protest of any of the Liabilities, or the obligation of any person, firm or corporation held by Lessor as collateral security, and (iii) notice of any failure by Tenant to pay, perform or observe, as applicable, any of the Liabilities or of any Event of Default (as defined in the Lease); (b) all defenses, offsets and counterclaims which Guarantor may at any time have to any of the Liabilities, except to the extent the same is a valid defense, offset or counterclaim on the part of Tenant; and (c) all notices of the financial condition or of any adverse or other change in the financial condition of Tenant.
3. Lessor may, without notice, assign this Guaranty in whole or in part, and no assignment or transfer of the Lease or subletting of the Premises shall operate to extinguish or diminish the liability of Guarantor hereunder.
4. The liability of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be primary with respect to any right of action which shall accrue to Lessor under the Lease, and Lessor may, at its option, proceed against Guarantor without having to commence any action, or having obtained any judgment, against Tenant.
5. The Liabilities of Guarantor shall not be affected, impaired or discharged, in whole or in part, by reason of: (a) the entry of an order for relief pursuant to the United States Bankruptcy Code by or against Tenant; (b) the proposal of or the consummation of a plan of reorganization concerning Tenant; (c) the assignment of Tenant's obligations under the Lease or any other or further sublease of any portion of the Premises, whether or not any such assignment or sublease is permitted under the Lease; or (d) except by reason of actual payment and performance of Tenant's obligations under the Lease, the discharge of the obligations of Tenant to Lessor, provided, however, if Tenant, in accordance with the requirements of the Lease, assigns the Lease (including, without limitation, if and to the
 
extent permitted under Section 25.1.11 or Section 25.4 of the Lease, by virtue of a partial assignment of the Lease with respect to the Premises) to a Person (as defined in the Lease) that is not an Affiliate (as defined in the Lease) of Tenant, Tenant shall not be released from any of its duties, liabilities or obligations under the Lease on account of any such assignment, but Guarantor shall be released from this Guaranty insofar as it relates to any Liabilities of Tenant assumed by the assignee and arising on account of any breach or default of the Lease occurring after the date of such assignment.
6. The waiver of any right by Lessor or its failure to exercise promptly any right shall not be construed as the waiver of any other right including the right to exercise the same at any time thereafter. No waiver or modification of any of the terms or conditions of this Guaranty shall be binding against Lessor unless such waiver or modification is in a writing signed by Lessor.
7. The liability of Guarantor shall bind the respective representatives, successors and assigns of Guarantor and shall inure to the benefit of Lessor, its successors and assigns.
8. This Guaranty shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without reference to the choice of law principles thereof. Guarantor hereby agrees to submit to the jurisdiction of any court of general jurisdiction sitting in the State of New York and designates any officer or supervisory employee of Lessor located at the Premises as its agent and attorney in fact for the purpose of accepting service and making an appearance on its behalf in such proceeding and taking all such acts as may be necessary or appropriate in order to confer jurisdiction on it upon such court, provided such agent and attorney in fact shall promptly send a true copy of all materials so served to Guarantor at the address and in the manner specified in Section 9 below, and Guarantor stipulates that such consent and appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest.
