 Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") said today that first quarter 2007 normalized Funds from Operations ("FFO") rose 26 percent to $72.1 million, compared with $57.5 million in the first quarter of 2006. Normalized FFO per diluted share in the first quarter of 2007 increased 24 percent to $0.68, from $0.55 per diluted share for the comparable 2006 period. In the quarter ended March 31, 2007, the Company had 106.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, compared to 104.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding a year earlier.
LOUISVILLE, KY (May 8, 2007)
The Company's first quarter 2007 Funds Available for Distribution ("FAD") rose 30 percent to $67.8 million, compared with $52.3 million in the first quarter of 2006. FAD per diluted share in the first quarter of 2007 increased 28 percent to $0.64, from $0.50 per diluted share for the comparable 2006 period.
Results for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 benefited from increased rent resulting from a full quarter of rent from the Company's 2006 acquisitions, the Rent Reset on the 225 healthcare facilities the Company leases to Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: KND) ("Kindred") and the Company's strong internal growth rate from its existing leases.
"Our excellent growth this quarter reflects the earnings power we have built into our seniors housing and healthcare portfolio," Ventas Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Debra A. Cafaro said. "With the recent addition of 77 high-quality private pay Sunrise assets, the disposition of underperforming Kindred assets and our robust Sunrise development pipeline, we are transforming and upgrading our portfolio while we continue to grow and create shareholder value," she added.
Cafaro stated that, "The truly transformational nature of the Sunrise REIT acquisition is demonstrated by the fact that approximately 40 percent of our annualized revenues at June 30, 2007 should come directly from residents in our private pay seniors housing communities. This transaction creates ideal diversification, stability and granularity in a major portion of our portfolio, similar to that seen in the apartment sector, and should reduce risk in our enterprise going forward. In addition, the fundamentals in private pay seniors housing are very strong and should drive above average internal growth."

FIRST QUARTER 2007 RESULTS
Rental income for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 was $120.8 million, of which $60.3 million resulted from leases with Kindred. First quarter 2007 expenses totaled $76.7 million, which included a gain of $5.8 million from a foreign currency hedge. Depreciation and amortization totaled $33.4 million and interest expense totaled $40.6 million. General, administrative and professional fees totaled $7.6 million and include $2.0 million for non-cash stock-based compensation. Property-level operating expenses relating to the Company's MOB portfolio and other assets for the period were $0.9 million.
UPDATED NORMALIZED FFO GUIDANCE FOR 2007
Ventas currently expects its 2007 normalized FFO per diluted share to be between $2.55-2.65 per diluted share, excluding Sunrise REIT merger costs and the impact of its lease up and development assets, assuming only the Company's announced acquisitions and divestitures, but excluding additional acquisition, divestiture and joint venture activity. The Company's FFO expectation is based on a balanced long-term capital structure. Included within the Company's 2007 normalized FFO range is approximately $7-8 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, of non-cash equity compensation.
The Company's normalized FFO guidance for all periods assumes that all of the Company's tenants and borrowers continue to meet all of their obligations to the Company. In addition, the Company's normalized FFO guidance (and related U.S. generally accepted accounting principals ("GAAP") earnings projections) excludes (a) gains and losses on the sales of assets, (b) the impact of future, unannounced acquisitions, divestitures (including

pursuant to tenant options to purchase) and capital transactions, (c) merger-related costs and expenses that are not capitalized under GAAP, including transitional and severance expenses, amortization of fees related to acquisition financing and costs, gains and losses for foreign currency hedge agreements, (d) the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses or premiums incurred as a result of early debt retirement and (e) any dilution resulting from the Company's convertible notes.
The Company's guidance is based on a number of other assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.
A reconciliation of the Company's guidance to the Company's projected GAAP earnings is provided on a schedule attached to this press release. The Company may from time to time update its publicly announced guidance, but it is not obligated to do so.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO and FAD appropriate measures of performance of an equity REIT. The Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FAD represents normalized FFO excluding straight-line rental adjustments and capital expenditures.
FFO and FAD presented herein are not necessarily comparable to FFO and FAD presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Neither FFO nor FAD should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in
 
Ventas Reports First Quarter Earnings
May 8, 2007
Page 12
 
accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO or FAD necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs.
The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO and FAD should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
Normalized FFO Guidance for the Period Ending December 31, 2007

Net Debt to Pro Forma EBITDA
The following pro forma information considers the effect on net income, interest and depreciation of the Company's investments and other capital transactions that were completed during the three months ended March 31, 2007, as if the transactions had been consummated as of the beginning of the period. The following table illustrates net debt to pro forma annualized earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") (dollars in thousands):
 
The Company considers EBITDA a profitability measure which indicates the Company's ability to service debt. The Company considers the net debt to pro forma EBITDA ratio a useful measure to evaluate the Company's ability to pay its indebtedness. EBITDA presented herein is not necessarily comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is EBITDA necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
