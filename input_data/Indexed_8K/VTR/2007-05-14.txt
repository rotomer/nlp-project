Item 8.01. Other Events.
Ventas, Inc. (the "Company") has submitted for stockholder approval at its 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders a proposal to amend its Certificate of Incorporation to include certain provisions limiting the constructive ownership of the Company's capital stock in order to provide further assurances for its continued compliance as a qualified real estate investment trust under U.S. federal income tax law. Assuming stockholders approve the proposal and in keeping with its best corporate governance practices, the Company intends to submit for future stockholder approval, at the earliest practicable time, a proposal to delete Section (4) of the proposed amendment relating to Board waivers.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
