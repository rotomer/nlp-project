Exhibit 99.2
Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust
Consolidated Financial Statements
Audited information for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005
(In thousands of Canadian dollars)
 
To the Unitholders of Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust (the "REIT") as at December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the consolidated statements of operations, changes in unitholders' equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the REIT's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards and the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the REIT's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the REIT as at December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.

(See accompanying notes)
 
 
Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust (the "REIT") is an unincorporated open-ended real estate investment trust established under the laws of the province of Ontario by a Declaration of Trust dated August 13, 2004, as amended and restated on November 11, 2004 (the "Declaration"). The REIT invests in a portfolio of premium senior living communities located throughout North America and began operations on December 23, 2004 when it completed its initial public offering ("IPO") and acquired its initial asset portfolio.
Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. ("Sunrise") was the promoter of the REIT's IPO on December 23, 2004. Virtually all of the REIT's assets at December 31, 2006 and 2005 consisted of real properties managed by, and real property secured loans made to, Sunrise. In addition, two members of Sunrise's management serve on the REIT's Board of Trustees.
 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are summarized as follows:
 
The financial statements include the accounts of the REIT, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and entities over which it exercises control. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
 
A variable interest entity ("VIE"), as defined by Accounting Guideline 15, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("AcG-15") is consolidated by the party (the "primary beneficiary"), if any, that is exposed to the majority of the VIE's expected losses and/or expected residual returns. The REIT consolidates all entities for which it has determined that it is the primary beneficiary.
 
The REIT accounts for business combinations using the purchase method. Under this method, the REIT identifies and assesses the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Buildings are valued using an "as-if vacant" methodology. Land is recorded at appraised value and furniture and fixtures are valued at depreciated replacement cost. The purchase price is then allocated to the identified assets and liabilities based upon relative asset fair value. Purchase price in excess of the identified assets' collective fair value is recorded as goodwill. Resident intangibles and debts assumed are recorded at their fair values.
 
 
The REIT's receivable from related party, mezzanine loans receivable, restricted cash, cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, distributions payable, amounts due to related party, income taxes payable and variable rate debt are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.
The REIT uses forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the effect of currency exchange fluctuations on distributable income earned from its foreign operations. These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and are reported on a mark-to-market basis in the consolidated statements of operations. In addition, the REIT uses interest rate contracts to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations. The REIT has entered into an agreement to limit the interest rate on a variable rate mortgage loan. This instrument does not qualify for hedge accounting and is reported on a mark-to-market basis in the consolidated statements of operations.
 
Income properties are recorded at cost less related impairment charges, if any. Depreciation on buildings is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 40 years. Depreciation of furniture and fixtures is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets of up to 15 years.
Acquired intangible assets are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition and primarily consist of in-place resident agreements and relationships. Intangible assets are amortized over the estimated life of the resident agreements which approximates 15 months.
 
Properties under development are stated at cost less related impairment charges, if any. Cost is comprised of acquisition costs including fixed purchase price amounts, direct development costs, property taxes, interest on both specific and general debt and property operating expenses, net of revenue received, during the initial community occupancy period. Capitalization of costs to properties continues until the property is substantially complete. A property is considered to be substantially complete at the earlier of the property reaching a satisfactory occupancy level, a cash flow break-even level or a predetermined date after the property has commenced operations.
 
The REIT reviews its long-lived assets, which include real estate properties and certain identifiable intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets.
 
Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits and short-term investments, with remaining maturities less than 90 days at date of purchase, and are stated at cost, which approximates market value.
 
 
Cash and cash equivalents are considered restricted when they are subject to contingent rights of third parties and are excluded from cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets.
 
Deferred financing costs are amortized over the terms of the related financing and are included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
 
The REIT accounts for its convertible debentures by assessing the allocation of the fair value between the liability and the equity component. Interest expense, computed at the fair market value interest rate determined at the date of issuance and assessed on the allocable liability amount, is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.
 
Agreements with residents are for a one-year term and are cancelable by residents with 30 days' notice. The REIT recognizes base revenue due under these agreements, including up-front fees, on a straight-line basis in equal periodic amounts over the term of the agreement. Revenue derived from providing additional services to residents is recognized as those services are provided. Interest income is recognized when earned.
 
The REIT received income support, which was determined based upon the performance of certain properties in comparison to minimum financial thresholds. Income support received from the property vendor as part of a property acquisition has been recognized as an adjustment to the carrying value of the property acquired. Income support received from Sunrise, pursuant to the management agreement, has been recognized as a reduction of management fees in the period to which the income support relates.
 
The REIT accounts for unit-based compensation awards using the fair value method. Under this method, compensation expense for the unit options granted is based on the fair value of the options at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model and expensed over the vesting period of the options granted with a corresponding increase in contributed surplus.
 
The REIT uses the liability method of tax allocation in accounting for future income taxes. Under this method, temporary differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of assets, liabilities and unitholders' equity result in either future income tax assets or liabilities. The REIT computes its future tax assets and liabilities using enacted or substantively enacted rates for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. In addition, future income tax assets and liabilities arising in connection with a business acquisition recognized under the purchase method of accounting are recorded as part of the allocation of the purchase price.
 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Canadian dollars at rates of exchange at the time of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into Canadian dollars at current foreign exchange rates with the resultant gains or losses included in income.
 
 
Financial statements of the REIT's self-sustaining foreign operations are translated into Canadian dollars using the current rate method. Under this method, assets and liabilities are translated into Canadian dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the period end while revenues and expenses are translated into Canadian dollars using exchange rates approximating those in effect when the transactions occur. Exchange gains or losses on translation of financial statements are deferred and disclosed in a separate component of unitholders' equity.
The appropriate amounts of exchange gains or losses accumulated in the separate component of unitholders' equity are reflected in income when there is a realized reduction as a result of capital transactions, in the REIT's investment that gave rise to such exchange gains and losses.
 
The REIT has a long-term incentive plan ("LTIP") with respect to certain eligible employees. Under the LTIP, additional compensation is allocated to the employees upon the REIT's achieving specified financial results. Amounts payable under the LTIP are expensed over the three-year vesting period.
 
Certain items in the comparative consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation adopted in the current period.
 
 
On March 30, 2006, the REIT completed the acquisition of a 100% interest in a U.S. income-producing property for approximately $43,726 (US$37,437), including transaction costs. The REIT funded the transaction by assuming and immediately refinancing the existing mortgage of $13,280 (US$11,370) with $25,579 (US$21,900) of new mortgage debt with a 10-year term, bearing interest at 6.26%, a 90 day note from the vendor of $17,614 (US$15,080), bearing interest at 6.0% for the first 30 days and 12.0% for the last 60 days, and the remainder from the REIT's line of credit. Sunrise owned a non-controlling interest in the property and received $7,448 (US$6,377) as a vendor in this transaction. The results of operations of this property have been consolidated from the date of acquisition. The 90-day note from the vendor was repaid with proceeds from the public offering of units completed in April 2006 (note 9 and 12).
On June 6, 2006, the REIT acquired 80% interests in two U.S. communities which are under development. The acquisitions were pursuant to a Fixed Price Acquisition Agreement ("FPAA") with Sunrise that also resulted in the repayment of related mezzanine loans (notes 6 and 7). These acquisitions were funded by the proceeds received from Sunrise of $9,904 (US$8,968) upon repayment of the outstanding mezzanine loans, assumption of existing construction loan debts of $17,349 (US$15,714) and the remainder from the REIT's line of credit. Sunrise owns the remaining 20% interest in these properties. Upon acquisition, the REIT consolidates these properties as they no longer qualify as VIEs.
On September 13, 2006, the REIT acquired an 80% controlling interest in 24 U.S. income-producing properties. This acquisition was funded by the assumption of existing mortgages of $275,142 (US$245,290), proceeds from a private placement of approximately 4,843,000 units ($46,000) (note 12), net of costs, the private placement of $88,000 in convertible debentures net of costs (note 10), a draw of $27,000 on the REIT's line of credit, additional net proceeds received upon refinancing the debt assumed of approximately $89,904 (US$80,149) (note 9) and the balance through existing cash on-hand.
 
 
Sunrise owns the remaining interest in this portfolio and received refinancing proceeds, net of fees, of approximately $20,142 (US$17,957). The REIT also paid Sunrise $561 (US$500) as a fee for arranging the refinancings.
In connection with the acquisition of the 24 properties, two of the properties are subject to land leases. One of the properties acquired has a land lease that expires on June 30, 2094 (note 14).
The other property has a land lease that expires on October 26, 2085. This lease was paid in full by the former lessee with a single payment of US$2,375 on October 26, 2000. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. At the date of acquisition, the prepaid lease had a net book value of $2,479 (US$2,210), which approximated its fair market value.
The acquisitions are summarized as follows:
 
The purchase price allocations are subject to change based on the final determination of the purchase price and/or the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. As a result the purchase price allocation may be adjusted in the succeeding year.
 
On June 17, 2005, the REIT acquired three U.S. income-producing properties for $93,157 (US$75,400) plus transaction costs of $878, for a total purchase price of $94,035. The acquisition was funded with $55,894 (US$45,240) of new mortgage debt, the proceeds of a $24,975 equity offering and the REIT's operating line of credit. Sunrise owned a non-controlling interest in one property and received $9,390 (US$7,600) as a vendor in this transaction.
On October 4, 2005, the REIT acquired a fourth income-producing property from the same vendors, excluding Sunrise, for $21,045 (US$18,100). This acquisition was funded with approximately $12,627 (US$10,860) of new mortgage debt with the balance being funded by the REIT's operating line of credit.
Concurrent with these acquisitions, the vendors entered into cross-collateralized income support agreements ("ISAs") with respect to all four properties. Pursuant to the ISAs, the vendors will support the communities' net operating income until December 31, 2006, a period that may be extended if the properties do not meet specified earnings targets for the quarter ending December 31, 2006 and funds
 
 
are remaining. The maximum amount recoverable under the ISAs was US$3,500, which was secured by an escrowed cash deposit. The remaining escrow balance at December 31, 2005 was approximately $2,100 (US$1,800) which amounts were received under the ISAs during 2006. All amounts were accounted for as a purchase price reduction.
On June 17, 2005, and pursuant to a FPAA, the REIT acquired an 80% interest in a VIE that owns a Canadian property under development ("Erin Mills"). Upon acquisition, the REIT consolidates this property as the entity no longer qualifies as a VIE. The acquisition was funded by the proceeds received upon repayment of an outstanding mezzanine loan ($4,827, plus accrued interest of $103), the assumption of a construction loan facility, of which $9,984 was outstanding at acquisition, and the REIT's operating line of credit. The REIT incurred transaction costs of $1,115 with respect to this acquisition.
On August 9, 2005, the REIT acquired an approximate 75% controlling interest in 13 U.S. assisted living communities for $329,429. This acquisition was funded by the assumption of existing mortgage debt of $153,614 (US$126,171), proceeds of a public offering $151,430, additional net proceeds received upon refinancing the debt assumed of $51,180 and issuance of a non-controlling interest.
Sunrise owns the non-controlling interest and received refinancing proceeds, net of fees, of approximately $18,024 (US$14,804) and was paid $2,313 (US$1,900) in fees for arranging the refinancing.
On December 9, 2005, the REIT acquired four income-producing properties in the U.S. for approximately $100,006 (US$85,000). The acquisition was funded with $63,910 (US$55,000) of new mortgage debt, a bridge term facility of $35,000 and the REIT's operating line of credit.
On December 30, 2005, the REIT completed the acquisition of one Canadian income-producing property for approximately $27,800. The acquisition was funded through the assumption of the existing mortgage debt of $17,000 and the REIT's operating line of credit.
The results of operations of these properties have been consolidated from the date of acquisition. The acquisitions are summarized as follows:
 
 
 
The REIT has paid additional acquisition costs and expenditures at its two properties under development (note 6) of $7,354 (US$6,594) during the year ended December 31, 2006.
During 2006, the REIT capitalized additional costs of property development of $538 related to the Erin Mills property (see note 6).
 
During the year ended December 31, 2006, the REIT incurred $5,627 of capital expenditures at income-producing properties. Included in the capital expenditures is approximately $1,229 (US$1,100) related to the redevelopment of the property in Yorba Linda, California. The REIT also received or accrued $2,054 (US$1,840) of purchase price adjustments related to the acquisition of four income-producing properties in June and October of 2005. The REIT also received a purchase price adjustment of $4,307 related to the refund of Canadian Goods and Services Tax from the acquisition of certain properties at the time of the REIT's IPO. Lastly, the REIT incurred additional costs of $335 (US$287) related to four income-producing properties acquired in December 2005.
During the year ended December 31, 2005, the REIT incurred $3,181 of capital expenditures at income-producing properties. The REIT also paid out during 2005, amounts totaling $4,953 that had been accrued at December 31, 2004 related to certain liabilities that were assumed and non-income taxes related to the acquisitions at the time of the IPO. The REIT also received a purchase price adjustment with respect to one of the asset pools acquired at the time of the IPO of $1,086. In addition, pursuant to ISAs regarding the four income-producing properties acquired in June and October 2005, the REIT accrued purchase accounting adjustments receivable of $1,554 (US$1,336) which were collected in 2006.
 
Income properties are recorded at cost and consist of the following:
 
 
 
Intangible assets are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition as follows:
 
 
At December 31, 2006, the REIT had two properties under development which were acquired in June 2006 (note 3). With respect to these two properties the REIT capitalized $2,022 (US$1,735) of costs, net of revenues received, including interest of $1,359 (US$1,166).
During September 2006, a property under development which was acquired in June of 2005 attained substantial completion and became income-producing. With respect to this property, the REIT capitalized $538 of costs, net of revenues received, (including $947 of interest) and $2,903 of costs, net of revenues received, (including interest of $534), during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, while it was under development.
On August 1, 2005, a property under development, acquired as part of the REIT's initial public offering, attained substantial completion and became income-producing. In the year ended December 31, 2005, costs capitalized, net of revenues received, with respect to this property while it was under development were $437 (including $526 of interest).
Additionally, properties under development include $5,905 (2005$3,479) of costs incurred with respect to properties which are the subject of FPAAs with Sunrise (note 14).
 
Mezzanine loans receivable consist of construction loans for properties under development pursuant to FPAAs. Each loan matures nine months after the expected date of receipt of the certificate of occupancy or, if earlier, upon exercise of the related option under the FPAA. The loans are generally fully collateralized by Sunrise guarantees and, when permitted by the senior development lender, the property under development.
The REIT has extended mezzanine loans totaling $40,919 (December 31, 2005$51,297). Under the agreements, the REIT and Sunrise have call and put option rights that may result in the REIT acquiring individual properties upon the occurrence of specific future events (note 14).
During the year ended December 31, 2006, the REIT exercised its option with respect to two properties under the FPAAs and acquired an 80% interest in each of the properties (note 3). Concurrent with this option exercise, Sunrise repaid the mezzanine loans that had been extended to these two properties.
At December 31, 2006, the REIT has $119 (December 31, 2005$50) of interest receivable from Sunrise related to the mezzanine receivables.
 
 
Mezzanine loans outstanding are as follows:
 
The borrowing entities are considered to be VIEs, however the REIT has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary. As a result the REIT accounts for these loans using the cost method. The REIT's maximum exposure from these VIEs was $46,824 at December 31, 2006 (December 31, 2005$54,646).
The Staten Island and Sandy properties both obtained their Certificate of Occupancy and opened during the fourth quarter of 2006. The REIT has exercised its option to acquire these properties and the closing will occur upon satisfaction of certain conditions by Sunrise, as outlined in the FPAAs (see note 19). As a result of the properties opening, the mezzanine loans are due and payable on demand. The REIT continues to recognize interest on these loans.
 
Other assets consist of the following:
 
 
 
 
Debt is collateralized by first mortgage liens on specific properties.
 
Canadian debt includes $79,885 of fixed rate debt bearing interest at 5.97%.
On July 27, 2006, the REIT repaid a variable rate mortgage of $17,000 by drawing on its line of credit.
In addition, the REIT assumed a construction loan facility on June 17, 2005 in connection with the acquisition of a property under development. The construction loan facility is collateralized by the property and has a maximum amount available of $15,000 of which $12,969 has been drawn at December 31, 2006. This facility bears interest at prime plus 115 basis points and is repayable on the earlier of 24 months after the date of completion of construction or six months after the debt service coverage ratio of 135% is achieved. The prime rate at December 31, 2006 was 6.0%. During September 2006, this property attained substantial completion and became income-producing.
Principal payments on Canadian dollar denominated debt, exclusive of the construction loan facility and the Canadian operating line discussed below, are as follows:
 
 
Total U.S. mortgage debt includes $856,067 of fixed rate debt at rates ranging between 5.60% and 6.26% per annum and $58,387 of variable rate debt. The variable rate debt bears interest at floating rates determined by reference to LIBOR. The REIT has entered into an agreement to limit the maximum interest rate to 8.0%. The weighted average effective rate on the U.S. mortgage debt at December 31, 2006 was 6.08%.
The REIT assumed two construction loan facilities on June 6, 2006, in connection with the acquisition of 80% interests in two properties under development (note 3). The construction facilities are collateralized by the properties and have a maximum availability of $16,229 (US$13,926) and $11,258 (US$9,660) for Bloomfield and Hillcrest respectively. As of December 31, 2006, $14,175 (US$12,163) and $10,903 (US$9,356) have been drawn upon the Bloomfield and Hillcrest loans, respectively. Sunrise owns the remaining 20% interests. Both the REIT and Sunrise are subject to restrictive covenants under these facilities.
At December 31, 2006, the REIT and Sunrise were in violation of restrictive covenants with respect to these construction loan facilities. The REIT's violations were related to specific operational covenants, and Sunrise's violations were due to financial reporting requirements which were not met due to their ongoing internal review. Both parties have received waivers with respect to these violations. The REIT is currently renegotiating these covenants to levels with the lender that will prevent violations in future periods.
 
 
The REIT acquired a property in the U.S. on March 30, 2006 (note 3). The REIT refinanced an existing mortgage with $25,579 (US$21,900) of new 10-year term, mortgage debt with a fixed interest rate of 6.26%. There are no principal repayments due on this mortgage for the first year. In addition, the REIT had a 90-day note from the vendor of the property for $17,614 (US$15,080), bearing interest at 6.0% for the first 30 days and 12.0% for the last 60 days. This 90-day note was repaid on April 20, 2006 with the proceeds from the public offering of 8,000,000 of the REIT's units (note 12).
The REIT acquired 24 properties on September 13, 2006 (note 3) and the existing mortgages were refinanced. The first new mortgage debt is for $139,713 (US$125,000), has a 7-year term and bears interest at 5.99%. The second new mortgage debt is for $247,571 (US$221,500), has a 10-year term and bears interest at 6.05%.
Principal payments on U.S. dollar denominated debt, exclusive of the construction facilities and the U.S. operating line discussed below, are as follows:
 
 
In addition to debts secured by specific properties, the REIT has two collateralized operating lines, one for its Canadian operations and one for its U.S. operations. These operating lines are collateralized by first mortgage liens on specific properties.
As noted above, on July 27, 2006, the REIT repaid the variable rate mortgage of $17,000 with respect to its Vancouver property by drawing upon its Canadian operating line of credit. On August 1, 2006, the REIT completed the renegotiation of its Canadian operating line of credit. The new operating line increases the REIT's borrowing capacity to $77,000 from $57,500 and provides an additional $10,000 for use as collateral for the REIT's foreign exchange hedging contracts. The new line bears interest at floating rates determined by reference to Canadian prime lending rates plus 0.5% and expires on July 1, 2008. At December 31, 2006, $35,528 (December 31, 2005$41,875) was outstanding under this facility with an effective interest rate of 6.5%.
At December 31, 2006, the REIT was in violation of certain covenants with respect to the Canadian operating line primarily due to costs related to the transaction with Ventas Inc. ("Ventas") (see Note 19). The REIT has received a waiver from the lender with respect to these violations at December 31, 2006.
The REIT also had outstanding during 2006 a Canadian non-revolving bridge facility that bore interest based upon a spread over the Canadian prime rate and this spread increased over time. This bridge facility was repaid and expired in April 2006 with proceeds from the public offering of 8,000,000 of the REIT's units (note 12).
 
 
The U.S. operating line has a maximum limit of US$15,000 that can be increased to US$25,000 and expires December 23, 2007. The U.S. operating line bears interest at floating rates determined by reference to U.S. prime lending and Federal Funds rates. This operating line was paid down with proceeds from the public offering of 8,000,000 of the REIT's units (note 12). At December 31, 2006, no amount was outstanding under this line.
Interest expense of $2,306 was capitalized with respect to properties under development for the year ended December 31, 2006 (2005  $1,060).
 
 
On September 1, 2006, the underwriters completed the exercise of their over-allotment option and the REIT issued an additional $7,500 of the 6.4% convertible debentures.
The 2006-1 debenture's equity component is $948, and as such, this amount has been allocated to the equity component and the remaining $56,552 has been allocated to the liability component.
 
The 2006-2 debenture's equity component is nominal in value, and as such, the entire fair value has been allocated to the liability component.
 
 
 
The non-controlling interest reflects Sunrise's investment in specific properties and is comprised of the following:
 
Included in the distributions above, Sunrise received $23,623 (US$21,060) of proceeds from the refinanced mortgages associated with the 24 properties acquired in September 2006 before their share of transaction costs (note 3). Included in distributions in 2005 is $18,105 (US$14,804) of proceeds from the refinanced mortgages associated with the acquisition of its properties acquired in August 2005 (note 3).
 
 
The REIT is authorized to issue an unlimited number of units. Units issued and outstanding are as follows:
 
The issuance of the 4,843,000 units was undertaken by way of subscription receipts on September 6, 2006 that were exchanged for an equivalent number of units, in accordance with their terms, on September 12, 2006.
 
 
During 2005 the REIT implemented a distribution reinvestment plan ("DRIP"), which allows unitholders to reinvest their distributions, under certain circumstances, at an effective discount of 3%.
 
The REIT's incentive unit option plan for its employees and trustees (the "Plan") provides for option grants to a maximum of 10% of the outstanding units of the REIT with a maximum term of 10 years. The maximum number of units available that could be subject to options under the Plan was 5,858,711, of which 1,730,080 were available at December 31, 2006. All options granted under the Plan, prior to 2006, vest at a rate of 25% per annum commencing on the first anniversary after the date of grant, being fully vested after four years.
During 2006, the REIT issued 2,006,131 (2005  1,545,000) options at a weighted average price of $11.22 (2005$12.47). Of the options granted in 2006, 841,131 will vest at 50% per annum, being fully vested after two years and the remainder will vest at 25% per annum, being fully vested after four years. The fair value of the options, determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model, was a weighted average value of $0.42 per option (2005$0.42).
During the year ended December 31, 2006, 7,500 (2005  20,000) options were exercised at a price of $10 per unit option and 15,000 (2005  nil) options were forfeited.
The following assumptions were used for options granted:
 
Compensation expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $426 (2005$64).
 
 
A summary of the options issued and outstanding under the Plan is summarized as follows:
 
Details of options outstanding under the Plan at December 31, 2006 are summarized as follows:
 
 
The REIT has implemented a restricted unit plan, under which eligible employees and trustees will be entitled to earn performance-based compensation. Eligible employees and trustees are awarded a notional number of units and participate in the appreciation or depreciation of the value of the units based on increases or decreases in the market price. The awards may be settled in cash and/or units at the Board's discretion. At the date of grant, 27,515 notional units were granted at a per unit price of $9.74. During 2006, the REIT recognized compensation expense of $173 relating to the restricted unit plan.
 
Basic and diluted weighted average units for the year ended December 31, 2006 were 52,649,404. The unit options and convertible debentures have not been included in the weighted average diluted number of units as their impact was anti-dilutive. The number of potentially dilutive securities, comprised of units to be issued with respect to options, was 68,594 and 119,008 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The number of potentially dilutive securities, comprised of units to be issued with respect to convertible debentures, was 4,465,843 and 1,998,755 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
 
 
Basic and diluted weighted average units for the year 2005 were 34,040,133. In 2005 prior to the conversion of the convertible debentures issued in 2004, the convertible debentures and options have not been included in the weighted average diluted number of units as their impact was anti-dilutive. Had the debentures been converted at January 1, 2005 the weighted average diluted number of units outstanding would have increased by 1,998,755 units in 2005. The number of potentially dilutive securities, comprised of units to be issued in respect of options, was 119,008 at December 31, 2005.
 
The REIT is currently taxed as a Mutual Fund Trust for Canadian income tax purposes. Pursuant to the Declaration, the Trustees intend to distribute or designate all taxable income directly earned by the REIT to the REIT's unitholders and to deduct such distributions and designations for Canadian income tax purposes. Canadian and U.S. based corporate subsidiaries are subject to tax on their taxable income at rates of approximately 36.12% and 38.2%, respectively.
On December 21, 2006 the Minister of Finance (Canada) released draft legislation (the "Proposals") relating to the federal income taxation of publicly-traded trusts (such as income trusts and real estate investment trusts) and partnerships. The Proposals are contemplated to apply to a publicly-traded trust that is a specified investment flow-through entity (a "SIFT") which existed before November 1, 2006 ("Existing Trust") commencing with taxation years ending in or after 2011 (other than those Existing Trusts which qualify for the REIT Exception as described below).
Certain distributions attributable to a SIFT will not be deductible in computing the SIFT's taxable income, and the SIFT will be subject to tax on such distributions at a rate that is substantially equivalent to the general tax rate applicable to Canadian corporations. Distributions paid by a SIFT as returns of capital will not be subject to this tax. There will be circumstances where an Existing Trust may lose its transitional relief where the Existing Trust undergoes "undue expansion".
The new taxation regime will not apply to certain Existing Trusts that qualify as real estate investment trusts (the "REIT Exception") as defined in the Proposals. Accordingly, unless the REIT Exception is applicable to the REIT, the Proposals could, commencing in 2011, impact the level of cash distributions which would otherwise be made by the REIT. The Proposals do not fully accommodate the current business structures used by many Canadian real estate investment trusts and contain a number of technical tests that many Canadian real estate investment trusts, including the REIT, will likely find difficult to satisfy. The Minister's stated intention is to exempt real estate investment trusts from taxation as SIFTs in recognition of "the unique history and role of collective real estate investment vehicles". Accordingly, it is possible that changes to these technical tests will be made prior to their enactment in order to accommodate some or all of the existing Canadian real estate investment trusts. Alternatively, if the Proposals are not changed, existing Canadian real estate investment trusts, including the REIT, may need to restructure their affairs, if possible, in order to limit the application of the Proposals.
Based on the proposed legislation, the REIT is a SIFT and does not qualify for the REIT Exception.
 
 
The provision for income taxes is summarized as follows:
 
Certain of the REIT's subsidiaries have deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards for which a full valuation allowance has been provided.
 
 
The REIT and Sunrise have entered into FPAAs with respect to specific properties under development. Under these agreements each party has option rights that could result in the REIT acquiring some or all of the ownership interests in the underlying properties. Specifically, the REIT has call options to acquire an 80% interest in these properties at a fixed price. Should the REIT not exercise its option, Sunrise has a put option under which the REIT would be required to acquire the interest at 102.5% of the call option exercise price.
The REIT and Sunrise also have separate call and put options with respect to the remaining 20% interest. If the REIT acquires the initial 80% interest pursuant to the FPAA, and upon the occurrence of certain events, it may be required to purchase the remaining interest at a future date at a price equal to 20% of the property's appraised value at acquisition.
The purchase price payable with respect to the 80% interests under these option agreements are as follows:
 
 
 
Pursuant to the FPAAs, the REIT is obligated to pay Sunrise fees on a quarterly basis over the construction period for the right to acquire the property interests at a fixed price. Total fee obligations are $799 for 2007. During 2006, the REIT paid fees of $4,010, including $654 related to the two properties acquired during June 2006 (note 3).
The REIT intends to exercise its option with respect to each of the properties under an FPAA within the timeframe of the FPAAs. All of these are expected to occur during 2007.
 
In connection with the acquisition of 24 income-producing properties (note 3), the REIT assumed a land lease for the Alexandria, Virginia property. The lease expires on June 30, 2094 with two ten-year extensions. The lease has a base rent of US$165, which escalates ten percent every five years beginning in 2010. Lease expense will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the lease. The REIT recognized lease expense of $129 from the date of acquisition to December 31, 2006.
 
The REIT has lease commitments with respect to its administrative operations. The REIT has entered into a lease agreement for new office space for its U.S. office. The lease commenced on September 1, 2006 and expires on September 30, 2013. The REIT moved into this new space on December 1, 2006. The REIT has also leased office space for its Canadian office. This lease commenced on April 1, 2006 and expires on November 29, 2009. The REIT expensed $147 with respect to these properties during 2006. Prior to December 1, 2006, the U.S. office space was leased through Sunrise. The REIT recognized $86 (US$75) of rent expense which was paid to Sunrise.
 
 
The table below outlines future payments to be made under operating leases:

The REIT owns, develops and operates properties throughout North America. When measuring the REIT's performance, management does not distinguish or group its operations on a geographical or any other basis. Accordingly, the REIT has a single reportable segment.

The REIT's activities result in various financial risks. The following describes these financial risks, how the risks are managed by the REIT and the fair values of these financial instruments.
 
Interest rate risk arises with changes in interest costs, which affect the REIT's floating rate debt on an ongoing basis and its fixed rate debt upon renewal. The REIT entered into an interest rate cap agreement in 2005 to limit the interest rate on a variable interest mortgage debt entered into in 2005. The fair value of this agreement is $14.
 
Sunrise represents a significant credit risk to the REIT as a result of its outstanding mezzanine loans receivable balances. To partially mitigate this exposure, the REIT requires the mezzanine loans to be secured by the property when permitted by the senior lender.
 
The REIT has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on distributable income. These contracts expire monthly from January 2007 through May 2009. The notional amounts of the forward contracts are US$46,425, US$46,400 and US$19,333, for each of 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively, and are exchanged into Canadian dollars at a weighted average exchange rate of $1.1116.
 
The fair value of fixed rate mortgage debt at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $927,404 and $514,481, respectively. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is based upon quoted market prices.
Such fair value estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the REIT might pay or receive in actual market transactions. Potential transaction costs have also not been considered in estimating fair value.
 
The REIT incurs costs while investigating acquisitions and other transactions. Where GAAP allows, these costs are deferred until such time as the REIT determines whether or not the transaction is likely to be completed. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the REIT incurred substantial costs with respect to the process that resulted in an agreement with Ventas (see note 19).
 
 
 
The REIT has entered into the following transactions and agreements with Sunrise not otherwise described elsewhere in these consolidated financial statements:
 
Amounts paid or accrued to Sunrise are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On January 15, 2007, the REIT announced that it had agreed to a transaction with Ventas, wherein Ventas will acquire substantially all of the assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities of the REIT. Upon completion of the transfer of assets and liabilities to Ventas, the REIT will redeem all issued and outstanding units of the REIT at $15.00 per unit. A special committee of the board of trustees ("the Special Committee") and the board of trustees ("the Board") has reviewed the offer in consultation with external financial and legal advisers. The transaction will require approval of unitholders holding more than 66 2/3% of units represented at a special meeting of the unitholders.
The REIT and Ventas have entered into a mutually beneficial Purchase Agreement which provides that, among other things, a non-solicitation covenant on the part of the REIT, a right in favour of Ventas to amend the terms of the transaction if the REIT is presented with a superior offer, and a payment to Ventas of a break fee of $39.8 million in certain circumstances.
During the month of February, Healthcare Property Investors, Inc. ("HCP"), made a series of conditional proposals to acquire the REIT at a price in excess of the Ventas offer price. Each of the REIT, Ventas and Sunrise filed various applications with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List) (the "Superior Court") seeking a legal interpretation from the Superior Court of the Purchase Agreement and the confidentiality and other agreements amongst the various parties.
On March 6, 2007, the Superior Court ruled in favour of Ventas to enforce agreements which HCP was party to. On March 7, 2007, HCP withdrew its proposal.
The REIT and HCP each appealed the Superior Court's decision. The appeals were heard together by the Court of Appeal of Ontario on March 20, 2007. On March 23, 2007, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals.
The special meeting of unitholders to consider the proposed Ventas transaction will be held on April 11, 2007. There can be no assurances that unitholders will approve the proposed Ventas transaction at the special meeting.
Upon successful completion of this transaction, the REIT's financial advisors would receive a fee of approximately $8,600.
In connection with the transaction, the DRIP of the REIT has been suspended, effective following the distribution payable on January 15, 2007 to unitholders of record as at December 31, 2006.
 
During the period between December 31, 2006 and March 28, 2007, $42,873 of the 2006-1 Convertible Debentures and $83,000 of the 2006-2 Convertible Debentures have been converted into 3,519,940 and 7,904,756 units of the REIT, respectively.
 
As of March 28, 2007, the REIT has reached agreements to acquire 80% interests in the Staten Island, Sandy, Scottsdale and Rocklin communities which are expected to close during the first half of 2007. The acquisitions will be funded by the assumption of existing construction loan facilities, proceeds received from Sunrise upon repayment of the outstanding mezzanine loans and the remainder from the REIT's line of credit.

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") with respect to the preparation of interim financial information. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are prepared using the same accounting policies and application thereof as the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006, except as described in changes in accounting policies below (note 2). They do not include all the information and disclosure required by Canadian GAAP for annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2006 consolidated financial statements.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Certain items in the comparative financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation adopted in the current period.
 
 
On January 1, 2007, the REIT adopted CICA Handbook Section 1530, "Comprehensive Income" ("HB 1530"), Section 3855, "Financial Instruments  Recognition and Measurement" ("HB 3855"), Section 3861, "Financial Instruments  Disclosure and Presentation" ("HB 3861") and Section 3865 "Hedges" ("HB 3865").
HB 3861 establishes standards for presentation of financial instruments and non-financial derivatives and identifies the information that should be disclosed about them. HB 3865 describes when and how hedge accounting can be applied as well as the disclosure requirements.
These new standards do not require retroactive application and therefore the comparative figures have not been restated.
HB 3865 specifies the criteria under which hedge accounting can be applied and how hedge accounting should be executed for each of the permitted hedging strategies: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and hedges of a foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a self-sustaining foreign operation.
Under Section 1530, comprehensive income is comprised of net earnings and Other Comprehensive Income ("OCI") items, which represents changes in unitholders' equity during a period arising from transactions and other events with non-owner sources. OCI generally would include unrealized gains and losses on financial assets classified as available-for-sale, unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments net of hedging arising from self-sustaining foreign operations, and changes in the fair value of the effective portion of cash flow hedging instruments. The REIT has included a consolidated statement of comprehensive income and has presented accumulated other comprehensive income as a new component of the statement of changes in unitholders' equity.
HB 3855 establishes standards for recognizing and measuring financial assets, financial liabilities and non-financial derivatives. All financial instruments are required to be measured at fair value on initial recognition, except for certain related party transactions. Measurement in subsequent periods depends
 
 
on whether the financial instrument has been classified as held-for-trading, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, loans and receivables, or other liabilities. Financial assets and financial liabilities classified as held-for-trading are required to be measured at fair value with gains and losses recognized in net earnings. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred for a financial instrument classified as held-for-trading.
Financial assets classified as held-to-maturity, loans and receivables and financial liabilities (other than those held-for-trading) are required to be measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method of amortization. For such financial instruments, transaction costs are capitalized on initial recognition. The principal categories of the REIT's financial assets and liabilities measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method include: (i) amounts receivable and payable; (ii) loans receivable and debt; and (iii) convertible debentures.
Available-for-sale financial assets are required to be measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in OCI. Investments in equity instruments classified as available-for-sale that do not have a quoted market price in an active market should be measured at cost.
Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value including those derivatives that are embedded in a financial instrument or other contract but are not closely related to the host financial instrument or contract, respectively. Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments are required to be recognized in net earnings, except for derivatives that are designated as a cash flow hedge, in which case the fair value change for the effective portion of such hedging relationship is required to be recognized in OCI.
The standard permits the REIT to designate any financial instrument whose fair value can be reliably measured as held-for-trading on initial recognition or adoption of the standard, even if that instrument would not otherwise satisfy the definition of held-for-trading as set out in Section 3855.
The standard specifically excludes Section 3065, Leases, from the definition of financial instruments, except for derivatives that are embedded in a lease contract. Other significant accounting implications arising on adoption of the standard include the use of the effective interest method of amortization for any transaction costs or fees, premiums or discounts earned or incurred for financial instruments measured at amortized cost, and the recognition of the inception fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing financial guarantees. No subsequent re-measurement at fair value is required unless the financial guarantee qualifies as a derivative.
Direct financing costs relating to the issue of financial liabilities are no longer presented as a separate asset on the balance sheet and are now included in the carrying value of the financial liabilities. As a result, the REIT has reclassified unamortized deferred financing costs against the long-term debt and convertible debentures as follows:
 
 
The REIT has adopted the effective interest method of amortization for transaction costs or fees, premiums or discounts earned or incurred for financial instruments. The transition adjustment attributable to the re-measurement of financial assets and liabilities at fair value under these standards was not significant. The difference between the use of a straight-line method of amortization and the effective interest rate method did not have a significant impact on the results of operations of the REIT for the three-months ended March 31, 2007.
The following is a summary of the accounting model the REIT has elected to apply to each of its significant categories of financial instruments as of January 1, 2007.
 
 
The CICA released three new accounting standards that are effective for the Trust's fiscal year commencing January 1, 2008: HB 1535, "Capital Disclosures" ("HB 1535"); Section 3862, "Financial Instruments  Disclosures" ("HB3862"); and HB 3863, "Financial Instruments  Presentation" ("HB3863").
HB 1535 specifies the disclosure of: (i) an entity's objectives, policies and processes for managing capital; (ii) quantitative data about what the entity regards as capital; and (iii) whether the entity has complied with any capital requirements, and if it has not complied, the consequences of such non-compliance.
HB 3862 and HB 3863 replace the existing HB 3861. The new sections revise and enhance disclosure requirements, and carry forward unchanged existing presentation requirements. These new sections place increased emphasis on disclosures about the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments and how the entity manages those risks.
 
 
 
On March 30, 2007, the REIT acquired 80% interests in three U.S. communities under development. The acquisitions were pursuant to Fixed Price Acquisition Agreements ("FPAA") with Sunrise that also resulted in the repayment of related mezzanine loans (note 4 and 5). These acquisitions were funded by proceeds received from Sunrise of $16,409 (US$14,212) upon repayment of the outstanding mezzanine loans, assumption of existing construction loan debts of $34,989 (US$30,304) and the remainder from the REIT's line of credit.
 
 
 
The REIT capitalized additional costs and expenditures at its five properties under development (note 4) of $885 during the three months ended March 31, 2007.
 
At March 31, 2007, the REIT had five properties under development, three of which were acquired on March 30, 2007 (note 3). With respect to the other two properties under development, the REIT incurred $548 (US$474) of net costs (including $655 (US$567) of interest) during the three-month period ended March 31, 2007.
At March 31, 2006, the REIT had one property under development which was acquired in June 2005. The REIT incurred $305 of net costs (including $327 of interest), during the three-months ended March 31, 2006 with respect to this property.
Additionally, properties under development include $3,557 (2006$1,317) of costs incurred with respect to properties, which are the subject of Fixed Price Purchase Acquisition Agreements ("FPAAs") with Sunrise (note 11).
 
Mezzanine loans receivable consist of construction loans for properties under development pursuant to FPAAs. Each loan matures nine months after the expected date of receipt of the certificate of occupancy or, if earlier, upon exercise of the related option under the FPAA. The loans are generally fully collateralized by: i) Sunrise guarantees and; ii) the property under development (when permitted by the senior development lender).
 
 
The REIT has extended mezzanine loans totaling $24,277 (December 31, 2006$40,919). Under the agreements, the REIT and Sunrise have call and put option rights that may result in the REIT acquiring individual properties upon the occurrence of specific future events (note 11).
At March 31, 2007, the REIT had $390 (December 31, 2006$119) of interest on these mezzanine receivables from Sunrise.
Mezzanine loans outstanding are as follows:
 
The borrowing entities are considered to be Variable Interest Entities ("VIEs"), however the REIT has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary. As a result the REIT accounts for these loans using the cost method. The REIT's maximum exposure from these VIEs was $27,834 at March 31, 2007.
 
Debt is secured by first mortgage liens on specific properties.
 
Canadian debt includes $78,451 of fixed rate debt bearing interest at 5.97%.
In addition, the REIT assumed a construction loan facility on June 17, 2005 in connection with the acquisition of a property under development. The construction loan facility is secured by the property and has a maximum amount available of $15,000 of which $12,969 has been drawn at March 31, 2007 (December 31, 2006$12,969). This facility bears interest at prime plus 115 basis points and is repayable on the earlier of 24 months after the date of completion of construction or six months after the debt service coverage ratio of 135% is achieved.
 
Total U.S. mortgage debt includes $834,655 of fixed rate debt at rates ranging between 5.60% and 6.26% per annum and $57,534 of variable rate debt. The variable rate debt bears interest at floating rates determined by reference to LIBOR. The REIT has entered into an agreement to limit the maximum interest rate to 8.0%. The weighted average effective rate on the U.S. mortgage debt at March 31, 2007 was 6.07%.
 
 
On March 30, 2007, the REIT assumed three construction loan facilities in connection with the acquisition of 80% interests in three properties under development (note 3). The construction facilities are collateralized by the properties and have a maximum availability of $15,703 (US$13,600), $17,476 (US$15,136) and $15,772 (US$13,661) for Sandy, Scottsdale and Rocklin, respectively. As of March 31, 2007, $12,746 (US$11,039), $12,754 (US$11,046) and $9,590 (US$8,306) had been drawn upon each of the Sandy, Scottsdale and Rocklin loans, respectively. Sunrise owns the remaining 20% interests. Both the REIT and Sunrise are subject to restrictive covenants under these facilities.
The REIT assumed two construction loan facilities on June 6, 2006, in connection with the acquisition of 80% interests in two properties under development. The construction facilities are collateralized by the properties and have a maximum availability of $18,553 (US$16,069) and $12,869 (US$11,146) for Bloomfield and Hillcrest respectively. As of March 31, 2007, $14,315 (US$12,399) and $10,965 (US$9,497) have been drawn upon the Bloomfield and Hillcrest loans, respectively. Sunrise owns the remaining 20% interests. Both the REIT and Sunrise are subject to restrictive covenants under these facilities.
 
In addition to debts secured by specific properties, the REIT has two collateralized operating lines, one for its Canadian operations and one for its U.S. operations. These operating lines are collateralized by first mortgage liens on specific properties.
On August 1, 2006, the REIT completed the renegotiation of its Canadian operating line of credit. The new operating line increases the REIT's borrowing capacity to $77,000 from $57,500 and provides an additional $10,000 for use as collateral for the REIT's foreign exchange hedging contracts. The new line bears interest at floating rates determined by reference to Canadian prime lending rates plus 0.5% and expires on July 1, 2008. At March 31, 2007, $51,110 (December 31, 2006$35,528) was outstanding under this facility with an effective interest rate of 6.50%.
At March 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, the REIT was in violation of certain covenants with respect to the Canadian operating line primarily due to costs related to the transaction with Ventas Inc. ("Ventas") (note 14). The REIT has received a waiver from the lender with respect to these violations at March 31, 2007 and at December 31, 2006.
The U.S. operating line has a maximum limit of US$15,000 that can be increased to US$25,000 and expires December 23, 2007. The U.S. operating line bears interest at floating rates determined by reference to U.S. prime lending and Federal Funds rates. This operating line was paid down with proceeds from the public offering of 8,000,000 of the REIT's units. At December 31, 2006, no amount was outstanding under this line.
Interest expense of $570 was capitalized with respect to properties under development for the three months ended March 31, 2007 (2006  $327).
 
 
As discussed in Note 2 to these financial statements, the liability component of the 2006-1 convertible debentures has been reduced by the net book value of the deferred financing costs in accordance with HB3855.
 
 
As of March 31, 2007, $47,136 of the 2006-1 convertible debentures had been converted into 3,869,939 units of the REIT.
 
As discussed in Note 2 to these financial statements, the liability component of the 2006-2 convertible debentures has been reduced by the net book value of the deferred financing costs in accordance with HB3855.
The 2006-2 convertible debentures were registered on the Toronto Stock Exchange on January 7, 2007. As of March 31, 2007, $83,000 of the 2006-2 convertible debentures had been converted into 7,904,756 units of the REIT.
 
The non-controlling interest reflects Sunrise's investment in specific properties and is comprised of the following:
 
 
 
The REIT is authorized to issue an unlimited number of units. Units issued and outstanding are as follows:
 
 
 
During 2005 the REIT implemented a distribution reinvestment plan ("DRIP"), which allows unitholders to reinvest their distributions at an effective discount of 3%. In connection with the transaction with Ventas, the DRIP was suspended in January 2007 (note 14).
 
The REIT's incentive unit option plan for its employees and trustees (the "Plan") provides for option grants to a maximum of 10% of the outstanding units of the REIT with a maximum term of 10 years. The maximum number of units available that could be subject to options under the Plan was 7,039,204 of which 2,910,573 were available at March 31, 2007. All options granted under the Plan, prior to 2006, vest at a rate of 25% per annum commencing on the first anniversary after the date of grant, being fully vested after four years.
During the three-months ended March 31, 2007, no options were issued.
During the three-months ended March 31, 2006, the REIT issued 841,131 options which will vest at 50% per annum, being fully vested after two years. The fair value of the options, determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model, was a weighted average value of $0.52 per option.
During the three-month period ended March 31, 2006, 7,500 unit options were exercised at a price of $10 per option.
Compensation expense recorded for the three-months ended March 31, 2007 was $128 (2006  $78).
 
During the third quarter of 2006, the REIT implemented a restricted unit plan, under which eligible employees and trustees will be entitled to earn performance-based compensation. Eligible employees and trustees are awarded a notional number of units and participate in the appreciation or depreciation of the value of the units based on increases or decreases in the market price. The awards may be settled in cash and/or units at the Board's discretion. At the date of grant, 27,515 notional units were granted at a per unit price of $9.74.
During the three-month period ended March 31, 2007, an additional 38,277 notional units were granted to eligible employees at a price of $10.62 per unit. During the first quarter of 2007, the REIT recognized compensation expense of $74 related to the restricted unit plan.
During January 2007, the REIT settled 14,227 restricted units for $151 in cash at a price of $10.62 per unit.
 
Basic and diluted weighted average units at March 31, 2007 and 2006 were 65,018,997 and 45,510,378 respectively. The number of potentially dilutive securities, comprised of units to be issued with respect to unit options, was 1,047,525 and 185,687 for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The number of potentially dilutive securities, comprised of units to be issued with respect to convertible debentures, was 6,653,610 and nil for the three-month period ended March 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
 
 
The REIT is taxed as a "Mutual Fund Trust" for Canadian income tax purposes. Pursuant to the Declaration of Trust, the Trustees intend to distribute or designate all taxable income directly earned by the REIT to its unitholders and to deduct such distributions and designations for Canadian income tax purposes. Canadian based corporate subsidiaries are subject to tax on their taxable income under the Income Tax Act (Canada) at a rate of approximately 36.12%. The REIT has certain subsidiaries in the United States which are subject to tax on their taxable income at a rate of approximately 38.19%. During the three months period ended March 31, 2007 and 2006, the REIT recorded income tax expense of $nil and $112, respectively.
 
The REIT and Sunrise have entered into FPAAs with respect to specific properties under development. Under these agreements each party has option rights that could result in the REIT acquiring some or all of the ownership interests in the underlying properties. Specifically, the REIT has call options to acquire an 80% interest in these properties at a fixed price. Should the REIT not exercise its option, Sunrise has a put option under which the REIT would be required to acquire the interest at 102.5% of the call option exercise price.
The REIT and Sunrise also have separate call and put options with respect to the remaining 20% interest. If the REIT acquires the initial 80% interest pursuant to the FPAA, and upon the occurrence of certain events, it may be required to purchase the remaining interest at a future date at a price equal to 20% of the property's appraised value at acquisition.
At March 31, 2007, and pursuant to the terms of FPAAs, the REIT had options to acquire 80% interests in VIEs owning one Canadian and one U.S. property.
The purchase price payable with respect to the 80% interests under these option agreements are as follows:
 
The REIT expects to complete the acquisitions of North York and Staten Island in 2007.
Pursuant to the FPAAs, the REIT is obligated to pay Sunrise fees on a quarterly basis over the construction period for the right to acquire the property interests at a fixed price. Total fee obligations are $799 for 2007. During the three-months ended March 31, 2007, the REIT paid fees of $342 (2006$1,303).
 
 
The REIT owns, develops and operates properties throughout North America. When measuring the REIT's performance, management does not distinguish or group its operations on a geographical or any other basis. Accordingly, the REIT has a single reportable segment.
Geographical information
 
 
The REIT has entered into transactions with Sunrise not otherwise described elsewhere in these consolidated financial statements. These amounts relate to the operations of the properties and include employee salaries and operational overhead provided by Sunrise as well as management fees. Amounts paid or accrued to Sunrise for these items for the three month periods ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows:
 
At March 31, 2007, the REIT had a receivable from Sunrise of $3,989 (US$3,455) related to capital items in addition to mezzanine loan interest.
In 2006, the REIT received income support, determined based upon the performance of certain properties in comparison to minimum financial thresholds. Income support received from the property vendor as part of a property acquisition is recognized as an adjustment to the carrying value of the property acquired. Income support received from Sunrise is recognized as a reduction of management fees in the period to which the income support relates.
 
 
The REIT incurs costs while investigating acquisitions and other transactions. Where GAAP allows, these costs are deferred until such time as the REIT determines whether or not the transaction is likely to be completed. During the first quarter of 2007, the REIT incurred substantial costs with respect to the process that resulted in an agreement with Ventas (see note 15). In addition, at March 31, 2007, the REIT had accrued $10,559 of fees payable to its advisors upon the successful completion of the transaction with Ventas.
 
On January 15, 2007, the REIT announced that it had agreed to a transaction with Ventas, wherein Ventas would acquire substantially all of the assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities of the REIT. Upon completion of the transfer of assets and liabilities to Ventas, the REIT would redeem all issued and outstanding units of the REIT at $15.00 per unit. A special committee of the board of trustees ("the Special Committee") and the board of trustees ("the Board") reviewed the offer in consultation with external financial and legal advisers. The transaction required approval of unitholders holding more than 66 2/3% of units represented at a special meeting of the unitholders.
The REIT and Ventas entered into a mutually beneficial Purchase Agreement which provided that, among other things, a non-solicitation covenant on the part of the REIT, a right in favour of Ventas to amend the terms of the transaction if the REIT is presented with a superior offer, and a payment to Ventas of a break fee of $39.8 million in certain circumstances.
On April 11, 2007, the Purchase Agreement was amended to increase the purchase price so that upon completion of the transfer of assets and liabilities to Ventas, the REIT would redeem all issued and outstanding units of the REIT at $16.50 per unit.
The REIT held a special meeting of unitholders where the transaction was approved. Upon closing of the transaction on April 26, 2007, the REIT redeemed all issued and outstanding units and paid the REIT's financial advisors a fee of $10,559. During the month of April, the REIT incurred a charge of approximately $1,096 with respect to the accelerated vesting of stock options.

AUDITORS' REPORT ON RECONCILIATION TO UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
To 675975 Canada Inc. as Power of Attorney for Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust
On March 29, 2007, we reported on the consolidated balance sheets of Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust (the "REIT") as at December 31, 2006, and 2005, and the consolidated statements of operations, changes in unitholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended. In connection with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the related supplemental note entitled "Reconciliation to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles". This supplemental note is the responsibility of the REIT's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this supplemental note based on our audits.
In our opinion, such supplemental note, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein as at December 31, 2006, and 2005 and for the years then ended.

The consolidated financial statements of Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust (the "REIT") for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (the "Consolidated Financial Statements") and for the three month periods ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 (the "Interim Consolidated Financial Statements") have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as applied in Canada ("Canadian GAAP"). Generally accepted accounting principles as applied in the United States ("US GAAP") differ from those applied in Canada as discussed below.
This reconciliation to US GAAP should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the three month periods ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 and the audited consolidated financial statements for years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.
If US GAAP were employed, net loss would be adjusted as follows:
 
 
 
Under US GAAP, the convertible debt would not require bifurcation into debt and equity components. Accordingly, under US GAAP, the amount of convertible debentures at December 31, 2006 has been increased by $879, contributed surplus has decreased by C$948, and interest expense and net loss have both decreased by $69 for the year ended December 31, 2006.
The REIT issued convertible debentures at the time of its Initial Public Offering ("IPO"). The accounting for these convertible debentures was the same under both Canadian and US GAAP as under Canadian GAAP it was determined that the conversion option had nominal value, so no adjustments were required. These convertible debentures were converted into units of the REIT during 2005.
 
 
Consolidated Balance Sheets:
As a result of the above adjustments, the following captions on the REIT's consolidated balance sheets on a Canadian GAAP basis are compared to a US GAAP basis as follows:
 
 
 
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:
As a result of the above adjustments, the major captions on the REIT's consolidated statement of cash flows on a Canadian GAAP basis are reconciled to a US GAAP basis as follows:
 
Comprehensive Income:
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130 ("FAS 130") establishes standards under US GAAP for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components (revenues, expenses, gains and losses) in a full set of general-purpose financial statements. FAS 130 requires that all items that are required to be recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements.
FAS 130 requires companies to (i) classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in a financial statement, and (ii) display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately from capital stock, contributed surplus and retained earnings in the unitholders' equity section of the balance sheet.
 
 
The statements of comprehensive loss would be presented as follows on a US GAAP basis:
 
The accumulated other comprehensive income balances would be presented as follows on a US GAAP basis:
 
Recent U.S. accounting standards adopted:
Uncertainty in income taxes
In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes". FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with FIN 48 is a two-step process. The first step is recognition where the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is measurement where the tax position to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The adoption of FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007, did not have a material impact on the REIT's financial statements.
Recent U.S. accounting standards issued but not yet adopted:
Fair value measurements
In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 applies when other accounting pronouncements require or permit fair value measurements; it does not require new fair value measurements. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those years. The impact of the adoption of FAS 157 will depend upon the fair value measurements required at the time of adoption.

These unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial statements are prepared for informational purposes only and are based on assumptions and estimates considered appropriate by Ventas's management; however, they are not necessarily indicative of what the financial position or results of operations of Ventas actually would have been assuming the transactions had been consummated as of the dates indicated nor do they purport to represent the results of operations for future periods. Further, as these unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial statements include only those adjustments directly attributable to these transactions, they do not include the impact of any strategies that management may consider in order to continue to efficiently manage Ventas's operations. These unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements of Ventas, including the notes thereto, included in Ventas's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007.
The acquisition of Sunrise REIT will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The total purchase price of approximately $2.4 billion will be allocated to the assets and liabilities of the Sunrise REIT properties based upon their respective fair values. For purposes of these unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial statements, such allocation has been made based upon valuations and other studies which may be subject to adjustment. Accordingly, the allocation of the purchase price included in the accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial statements is preliminary.

FFO per diluted share outstanding follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):
 
 
 
Pro forma FFO is presented for information purposes only, and we do not expect that this information will reflect Ventas's FFO. Pro forma FFO was based on available information and upon assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, we consider FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT, and we use the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.
FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.
