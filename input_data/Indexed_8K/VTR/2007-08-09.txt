Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") said today that second quarter 2007 normalized Funds from Operations ("FFO") rose 38 percent to $82.1 million, compared with $59.5 million in the second quarter of 2006.
LOUISVILLE, KY (August 8, 2007)
Normalized FFO per diluted common share in the second quarter of 2007 increased 23 percent to $0.70, from $0.57 per diluted common share for the comparable 2006 period. The increase is attributable to the Company's acquisition program, its internal growth related to escalations on its triple-net lease portfolio, a full quarter's effect of the $33.1 million annual increase in rent from its tenant Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: KND) ("Kindred") and lease termination fees. FFO per diluted common share, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), in the second quarter of 2007 increased 55 percent to $0.87, from $0.56 per diluted common share for the comparable 2006 period.
The Company's second quarter 2007 normalized Funds Available for Distribution ("FAD") rose 40 percent to $76.6 million, compared with $54.6 million in the second quarter of 2006. Normalized FAD per diluted common share in the second quarter of 2007 increased 25 percent to $0.65, from $0.52 per diluted common share for the comparable 2006 period.
"We are pleased to report another quarter of industry-leading double-digit FFO growth as we continue to deliver excellent performance to our shareholders," Ventas Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Debra A. Cafaro said. "We are benefiting from our strategy of building a high-quality, diverse and productive portfolio of healthcare and seniors housing assets that we believe will position the Company for long-term growth and success, supported by our business's strong supply/demand fundamentals.
"During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of 78 high-quality, private-pay Sunrise senior living communities and sold 22 underperforming Kindred assets for a substantial gain," Cafaro added. "The Sunrise integration is going well, with the communities performing in line with our expectations and trending positively. We have fully repaid our bridge facility and we have a strong balance sheet and excellent liquidity."

In the quarter ended June 30, 2007, the Company had 117.8 million weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, compared to 104.4 million weighted average diluted common shares outstanding a year earlier. The Company had 133.5 million fully diluted common shares outstanding on June 30, 2007.
Normalized FFO for the six months ended June 30, 2007 was $154.2 million, or $1.37 per diluted common share, a 32 percent increase from $117.0 million, or $1.12 per diluted common share, for the comparable 2006 period.
Normalized FFO for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 excludes the net benefit (totaling $20.2 million and $25.9 million, respectively) of gains from merger-related currency transactions and income taxes, as well as a gain on the sale of securities, offset by merger-related costs (including fees for bridge financing and transitional expenses).
SUNRISE PORTFOLIO
The Company's senior living portfolio acquired from Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust ("Sunrise REIT") and managed by Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (NYSE: SRZ) ("Sunrise") contains 78 communities, including the recently opened and acquired Staten Island community. Ventas owns 100 percent of 18 of these communities and has a partnership share of between 75 percent and 85 percent in the remaining 60 communities. Ventas's partnership share of Net Operating Income after management fees ("NOI") was $17.9 million for those 78 communities for May and June 2007. Total community NOI was $20.8 million for the same two-month period. Ventas also reported five days of April 2007 Sunrise property operations in its financial statements and FFO results for the period ended June 30, 2007.
Ventas's share of NOI was $18.0 million during May and June 2007 for the 72 Sunrise communities that are considered "stabilized" (, open for at least four full quarters, or having achieved 95 percent occupancy). Total community NOI for the stabilized assets totaled $21.0 million for the same two month period.
i.e.
Average occupancy for these 72 stabilized communities was 92.3 percent. Occupancy has been trending positively since the end of the second quarter and was 93.6 percent at the beginning of August 2007, as Sunrise management has implemented targeted programs to increase occupancy at its communities.
Ventas's Sunrise portfolio contains six additional newly developed communities that are in lease up. These properties are expected to deliver stabilized unlevered yields of between 9 percent and 9.5 percent. Ventas's share of NOI at the development assets was ($0.2 million) during May and June 2007. The approximately ($0.01) per diluted share negative FFO impact of these communities has been included in normalized FFO and the full FFO impact of these six communities will be included in normalized FFO going forward. These assets collectively are expected to become accretive to earnings by early 2008.
GAAP NET INCOME
Net income available to common stockholders for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 was $174.6 million, or $1.48 per diluted common share, after discontinued operations of $134.7 million, compared with net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 of $29.3 million, or $0.28 per diluted common share, after discontinued operations of $1.7 million.
Net income available to common stockholders for the six months ended June 30, 2007 was $219.7 million, or $1.96 per diluted common share, after discontinued operations of $135.6 million, compared with net income for the six months ended June 30, 2006 of $58.4 million, or $0.56 per diluted common share, after discontinued operations of $3.1 million.

VENTAS INCREASES NORMALIZED FFO GUIDANCE FOR 2007 AND NARROWS RANGE
Ventas currently expects its 2007 normalized FFO to be between $2.60 and 2.67 per diluted share, excluding Sunrise REIT merger-related benefits and costs, assuming only the Company's announced acquisitions and divestitures, but excluding additional acquisition, divestiture and joint venture activity. As previously disclosed, included within the Company's 2007 normalized FFO range is approximately $7 million to $8 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, of non-cash equity compensation. For 2006, Ventas reported normalized FFO per diluted share of $2.44.
The Company's normalized FFO guidance for all periods assumes that all of the Company's tenants and borrowers continue to meet all of their obligations to the Company. In addition, the Company's normalized FFO

guidance (and related U.S. generally accepted accounting principals ("GAAP") earnings projections) excludes (a) gains and losses on the sales of assets, (b) the impact of future, unannounced acquisitions, divestitures (including pursuant to tenant options to purchase) and capital transactions, (c) merger-related benefits, costs and expenses that are not capitalized under GAAP, including transitional expenses, amortization of fees related to acquisition financing and costs, gains and losses for foreign currency hedge agreements, (d) the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses or premiums incurred as a result of early debt retirement, (e) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits, and (f) dilution resulting from the Company's convertible notes. The Company intends to provide investors with details regarding communities that are in development and lease up, including the NOI and FFO impact during lease up.
The Company's guidance is based on a number of other assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.
A reconciliation of the Company's guidance to the Company's projected GAAP earnings is provided on a schedule attached to this press release. The Company may from time-to-time update its publicly announced guidance, but it is not obligated to do so.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO and FAD appropriate measures of performance of an equity REIT. The Company uses the NAREIT definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FAD represents normalized FFO excluding straight-line rental adjustments and capital expenditures.
FFO and FAD presented herein are not necessarily comparable to FFO and FAD presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Neither FFO nor FAD should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO or FAD necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs.
The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO and FAD should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.

Net Debt to Pro Forma EBITDA
The following pro forma information considers the effect on net income, interest and depreciation of the Company's investments and other capital transactions that were completed during the three months ended June 30, 2007, as if the transactions had been consummated as of the beginning of the period. The following table illustrates net debt to pro forma annualized earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") (dollars in thousands):
 
The Company considers EBITDA a profitability measure which indicates the Company's ability to service debt. The Company considers the net debt to pro forma EBITDA ratio a useful measure to evaluate the Company's ability to pay its indebtedness. EBITDA presented herein is not necessarily comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is EBITDA necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
