Ventas, Inc. (the "Company") is re-issuing in an updated format its historical financial statements to satisfy Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") requirements as they relate to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS No. 144").
In compliance with SFAS No. 144, the Company has reported revenues, expenses and gain on sale from properties sold during the first six months of 2007 as components of discontinued operations for each period presented (including the comparable period of the prior year) in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, filed with the SEC on August 9, 2007. Under SEC rules, the same reclassification as discontinued operations is required for previously issued annual financial statements for each of the three years presented in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, if those financial statements are incorporated by reference in subsequent filings with the SEC made under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, even though those financial statements relate to periods prior to the date of sale. This reclassification has no effect on the Company's reported net income available to common stockholders or funds from operations.
This Current Report on Form 8-K updates Items 6, 7 and 8 of, and Exhibit 12 to, the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 (the "2006 Form 10-K") to reflect those properties sold during the first six months of 2007 as discontinued operations for all periods presented. All other items of the 2006 Form 10-K remain unchanged. The Company has not made any attempt to update matters in the 2006 Form 10-K, except to the extent expressly provided above.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), which requires us to make estimates and judgments about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the related disclosures. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. For more information regarding our critical accounting policies, please see "Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Long-Lived Assets
Investments in real estate properties are recorded at cost. We account for acquisitions using the purchase method. The cost of the properties acquired is allocated among tangible land, buildings and equipment and recognized intangibles based upon estimated fair values in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations." We estimate fair values of the components of assets acquired as of the acquisition date or engage a third party appraiser as necessary. Recognized intangibles, if any, include the value of acquired lease contracts and related customer relationships.
Our method for determining fair value varies with the categorization of the asset acquired. We estimate the fair value of buildings on an as-if-vacant basis, and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building. We determine the allocated value of other fixed assets based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over their estimated remaining useful lives. We determine the value of land either based on real estate tax assessed values in relation to the total value of the asset, internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio or third party appraisals. The fair value of in-place leases, if any, reflects (i) above and below market leases, if any, determined by discounting the difference between the estimated current market rent and the in-place rentals, the resulting intangible asset of which is amortized to rental revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any fixed rate renewal periods, if applicable, (ii) the estimated value of the cost to obtain tenants, including tenant allowances, tenant improvements and leasing commissions, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease, and (iii) an estimated value of the
 
Table of Contents
absorption period to reflect the value of the rents and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease-up period, as if the acquired space was vacant, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease. We also estimate the value of tenant or other customer relationships acquired by considering the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with such tenant, such tenant's credit quality, expectations of lease renewals with such tenant, and the potential for significant, additional future leasing arrangements with such tenant. We amortize such value, if any, over the expected term of the associated arrangements or leases, which would include the remaining lives of the related leases and any expected renewal periods.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, primarily consisting of our investments in real estate, for impairment indicators in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations and adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long-lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future cash flows and sales proceeds is less than book value. An impairment loss is recognized at the time we make any such determination. Future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted. We did not record any impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.
Loans and Other Amounts Receivable from Third Parties
We evaluate the collectibility of loans and other amounts receivable from third parties based on a number of factors, including (i) corporate and facility-level financial and operations reports, (ii) compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the borrowing or lease agreement, (iii) the financial stability of the applicable borrow or tenant and any guarantor and (iv) the payment history of the borrower or tenant. Our level of reserves, if any, for loans and other amounts receivable from third parties fluctuates depending upon all of the factors previously mentioned.
Revenue Recognition
Certain of our leases, excluding the Kindred Master Leases, but including the majority of our leases with subsidiaries of Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, which include Brookdale Living Communities, Inc. and Alterra Healthcare Corporation, "Brookdale Senior Living"), provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent. Base rental revenues under these leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the applicable lease. Income on our straight-line revenue is recognized when collectibility is reasonably assured. In the event we determine that collectibility of straight-line revenue is not reasonably assured, we establish an allowance for estimated losses. Recognizing rental income on a straight-line basis results in recognized revenue exceeding cash amounts contractually due from our tenants during the first half of the term for leases that have straight-line treatment.
Certain of our other leases, including the Kindred Master Leases, provide for an annual increase in rental payments only if certain revenue parameters or other contingencies are met. We recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases only if the revenue parameters or other contingencies are met rather than on a straight-line basis over the term of the applicable lease. We recognize income from rent, lease termination fees and other income once all of the following criteria are met in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") Staff Accounting Bulletin 104: (i) the agreement has been fully executed and delivered; (ii) services have been rendered; (iii) the amount is fixed or determinable; and (iv) the collectibility is reasonably assured.
Stock-Based Compensation
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123(R)"), which is a revision to SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS No. 123"). SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB Opinion No. 25"). Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123, except that SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under SFAS No. 123(R).
As required, we adopted the provisions of this accounting standard on January 1, 2006. We applied the modified-prospective transition method of adoption in which compensation cost is recognized beginning on the date we adopted the accounting standard for all share-based payments granted after the adoption date and for all awards granted to employees prior to the adoption date that remain unvested on the adoption date. See "Note 10Stock-Based Compensation" of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the effect the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) had on our consolidated financial statements.
 
Table of Contents
Gain on Sale of Facilities
We recognize sales of facilities only upon the closing of the transaction with the purchaser. Payments received from purchasers prior to closing are recorded as deposits and classified as other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Gains on facilities sold are recognized using the full accrual method upon closing when the collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured, we are not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale to earn the profit, we have received adequate initial investment from the buyer, and other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied. Gains may be deferred in whole or in part until the sales satisfy the requirements of gain recognition on sales of real estate under SFAS No. 66, "Accounting for Sales of Real Estate."
Fair Value of Derivative Instruments
The valuation of derivative instruments requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. Fair values for our derivatives are verified with a third party consultant. Such amounts and the recognition of such amounts in the financial statements are subject to significant estimates which may change in the future.

Table of Contents
Revenues
Rental income included in discontinued operations was $12.5 million and $14.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in our 2006 rental income, including rental income allocated to discontinued operations, reflects the recognition of (i) $11.3 million in additional rent relating to the properties acquired during 2006 ($7.0 million relates to the Senior Care acquisition), (ii) $58.9 million in additional rent relating to the full year effect in 2006 of properties acquired during 2005 ($46.4 million relates to the Provident acquisition), (see "Note 5Acquisitions" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), (iii) $15 million of rental income resulting from the Rent Reset under the Kindred Master Leases, (iv) a $6.8 million increase in rent from Kindred resulting from the 3.5% annual escalator under the Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2006 (prior to the Rent Reset) and (v) $1.7 million of additional rental income resulting from rent escalations on various other properties.
Interest income from loans receivable, which includes amortization of deferred fees, increased $2.0 million in 2006 primarily as a result of a bridge loan issued to affiliates of the seller of the Senior Care properties, which bore interest at a rate of approximately 10.4% during the time the loan remained outstanding. We recognized approximately $3.4 million of interest income from this loan, which was repaid upon consummation of the Senior Care transaction in November 2006. This was partially offset by a net decrease of $1.7 million from interest income in connection with a $17.0 million mezzanine loan made to Trans Healthcare, Inc. ("THI") in 2002, as this loan was repaid in full in March 2006. See "Note 7Loans Receivable" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Expenses
Interest expense includes $3.3 million and $3.9 million of amortized deferred financing costs for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest expense included in discontinued operations was $4.5 million and $5.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Total interest expense, including interest allocated to discontinued operations, increased $34.9 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily due to $40.7 million of additional interest expense due to increased debt to fund acquisitions made during 2006, partially offset by a $5.8 million decrease from lower effective interest rates. Our effective interest rate decreased to 7.3% for the year ended December 31, 2006, from 7.6% for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the properties acquired during 2006 and 2005. See "Note 5Acquisitions" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The increase in general, administrative and professional fees is attributable primarily to the expensing of stock options as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) at the beginning of 2006.
In April 2006, we refinanced our previous $300.0 million secured revolving credit facility and entered into a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, resulting in a loss from extinguishment of debt of $1.3 million primarily related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. In December 2005, we paid off our commercial mortgage backed securitires ("CMBS") loan and incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.4 million primarily related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.
In connection with the Kindred Rent Reset process, we incurred approximately $7.4 million of one-time costs which we expensed during 2006. These costs included fees of the final appraisers and third party experts, consulting fees and legal fees and expenses.
During 2006, we were notified by the Internal Revenue Service that it had completed its audit of our 2001 federal tax return with no additional tax being due. Accordingly, we reversed into income a previously recorded $1.8 million tax liability related to uncertainties surrounding the outcome of this audit. See "Note 12Commitments and Contingencies" of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
As a result of anticipated lower variable rate debt balances due to the payoff of our CMBS loan in December 2005, we entered into an agreement with the counterparty to our interest rate swap to reduce the notional amount of the swap to $100.0 million, from $330.0 million, for its remaining term in exchange for a payment to the counterparty of approximately $2.3 million. In addition, we recognized $3.3 million of a previously deferred gain recorded in connection with our 1999 transaction to shorten the maturity of a separate interest rate swap.
During 2005, we settled our previously disclosed litigation against Sullivan & Cromwell LLP and received net proceeds of $15.9 million, after payment of expenses in connection with the settlement. See "Note 14Litigation" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Table of Contents
With $2.0 million of the net proceeds received from the litigation settlement, we established and funded the Ventas Charitable Foundation, Inc. (the "Foundation") in 2005. The Foundation is used to support charitable and philanthropic causes important to the communities in which we operate and to our employees.
Discontinued Operations
The decrease in discontinued operations is a result of the sale of one facility in 2005 for $9.9 million in net cash proceeds and a recognized net gain on the sale of $5.1 million. In addition, the tenant paid us lease termination fees of approximately $0.2 million. Discontinued operations in 2005 includes the net income of 23 properties sold, whereas the discontinued operations in 2006 includes the net income from 22 properties sold. See "Note 6Dispositions" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenues
Rental income included in discontinued operations was $14.6 million and $15.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in our 2005 rental income, including rental income allocated to discontinued operations, reflects the recognition of (i) $59.5 million in additional rent relating to the Provident acquisition in 2005 and $26.4 million in additional rent relating to the full year effect in 2005 of properties acquired during 2004 and the annual escalators in 2005 (see "Note 5Acquisitions" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and (ii) a $6.7 million increase in rent from Kindred resulting from the 3.5% annual escalator under the Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2005.
 
Table of Contents
Interest income from loans receivable, which includes amortization of deferred fees, increased $2.0 million in 2005 primarily as a result of interest income in connection with a $17.0 million mezzanine loan made to THI in 2002, of which $4.0 million principal amount remained outstanding at December 31, 2005, and interest income on the six first mortgage loans made in 2005. During 2005, we invested $21.4 million in a portfolio of eight distressed mortgage loans, on which we earned interest of $1.0 million. As of December 31, 2005, the balance on the distressed mortgage loans portfolio had been repaid in its entirety.
The increase in interest and other income primarily relates to $1.3 million of fees associated with our investment in the portfolio of eight distressed mortgage loans described above and $0.8 million related to the recovery in 2005 of a previously written-off receivable.
Expenses
Interest expense includes $3.9 million of amortized deferred financing costs for each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Interest expense included in discontinued operations was $5.8 million and $5.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Total interest expense, including interest allocated to discontinued operations, increased $39.0 million in 2005 over 2004, primarily due to $49.9 million of additional interest expense due to increased debt to fund acquisitions made during 2005, partially offset by a $10.9 million decrease from lower effective interest rates. Our effective interest rate decreased to 7.6% for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 8.4% for the year ended December 31, 2004.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the properties acquired during 2005. See "Note 5Acquisitions" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The increase in property-level operating expenses relates solely to a full year of activity for the seven medical office buildings acquired during 2004 and the acquisition of two medical office buildings in the first quarter of 2005.
The increase in general, administrative and professional fees is attributable to costs associated with growth in our asset base, our initiative to develop and market our strategic diversification program, engage in comprehensive asset management, comply with regulatory requirements such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and to attract and retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives.
In December 2005, we paid off our CMBS loan and incurred a loss from extinguishment of debt of $1.4 million primarily related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. In September 2004, we refinanced indebtedness under our prior credit agreement at lower interest rates and incurred a loss from extinguishment of debt of $1.4 million related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.
As a result of anticipated lower variable rate debt balances due to the payoff of our CMBS loan in December 2005, we entered into an agreement with the counterparty to our interest rate swap to reduce the notional amount of the swap to $100.0 million, from $330.0 million, for its remaining term in exchange for a payment to the counterparty of approximately $2.3 million. In addition, we recognized $3.3 million of a previously deferred gain recorded in connection with our 1999 transaction to shorten the maturity of a separate interest rate swap.
During the fourth quarter of 2005, we settled our previously disclosed litigation against Sullivan & Cromwell LLP and received net proceeds of $15.9 million, after payment of expenses in connection with the settlement. See "Note 14Litigation" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
With $2.0 million of the net proceeds received from the litigation settlement, we established and funded the Foundation in 2005.
Discontinued Operations
The decrease in discontinued operations is a result of a lower net gain on the sale of properties in 2005. Discontinued operations in 2004 includes the net income of 25 properties sold, whereas the discontinued operations in 2005 includes only the net income from 23 properties sold.
In 2005, we completed the sale of one facility for $9.9 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a net gain on the sale of $5.1 million. In addition, the tenant paid us lease termination fees of approximately $0.2 million. In 2004, we completed the sale of two facilities for $21.1 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a net gain on the sale of $19.4 million. In addition, the tenant paid us lease termination fees approximating $0.5 million. The net gains and lease termination fees are included in discontinued operations for the respective years in which the dispositions occurred. See "Note 6Dispositions" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Table of Contents
Funds from Operations
Our funds from operations ("FFO") for the five years ended December 31, 2006 are summarized in the following table:
 
Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, we consider FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity real estate investment trust ("REIT") and we use the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.
FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements and data included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Asset/Liability Management
Asset/liability management is a key element of our overall risk management program. The objective of asset/liability management is to support the achievement of business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels. The asset/liability management process focuses on a variety of risks, including market risk (primarily interest rate risk) and credit risk. Effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and variability of FFO and net worth. The following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities, including the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Market Risk
We receive revenue primarily by leasing our assets under long-term triple-net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators, subject to certain limitations. We also earn revenue from our mortgage loans. Our obligations under our revolving credit facility are floating rate obligations whose interest rate and related monthly interest payments vary with the movement in LIBOR. The general fixed nature of our assets and the variable nature of our obligations create interest rate risk. If interest rates were to rise significantly, our lease and other revenue might not be sufficient to meet our debt obligations. In order to mitigate this risk, in September 2001, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in the original notional amount of $450.0 million to hedge floating rate debt for the period between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2008 (the "Swap"). The Swap is treated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes and is with a highly rated counterparty on which we pay a fixed rate of 5.385% and receive LIBOR from the counterparty. In 2003 and 2005, due to our lower expected future variable rate debt balances, we reduced the notional amount of the Swap to $330.0 million and then to $100.0 million for the remaining term of the Swap. See "Note 8Borrowing Arrangements" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. There are no collateral requirements under the Swap. As of December 31, 2006, the notional amount of the Swap was $100.0 million, which is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2008.
 
Table of Contents
To highlight the sensitivity of the Swap and our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates, the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of 100 basis points (BPS) in interest rates:
 
N/A Not applicable.
We paid $0.3 million under the Swap during the year ended December 31, 2006. Assuming that interest rates do not change, we estimate that we will pay less than $0.1 million on the Swap during the year ending December 31, 2007.
We had approximately $284.7 million and $208.2 million of variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in our outstanding variable rate debt from December 31, 2005 is primarily attributable to the assumption of $114.8 million of mortgage debt in conjunction with the Senior Care transaction that was repaid on January 2, 2007, offset by a reduction in our outstanding balance on the unsecured revolving credit facility. The Swap currently effectively hedges $100.0 million of our outstanding variable rate debt. Any amounts of variable rate debt in excess of $100.0 million are subject to interest rate changes. However, pursuant to the terms of certain leases with one of our tenants, if interest rates increase on certain debt that we have totaling $218.4 million as of December 31, 2006, our tenant is required to pay us additional rent (on a dollar-for-dollar basis) in an amount equal to the increase in interest expense resulting from the increased interest rates. Therefore, the increase in interest expense related to this debt is equally offset by an increase in additional rent due to us from the tenant. As of December 31, 2006, there was minimal cash flow impact from the fluctuation of interest rates on variable rate debt since we effectively hedged nearly all of our variable rate debt. The fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt is based on current interest rates at which similar borrowings could be made by us.
We may engage in additional hedging strategies in the future, depending on management's analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. Our market risk sensitive instruments are not entered into for trading purposes.
Credit Risk
As a result of our spin off of Kindred in May 1998 and the Provident acquisition in June 2005, we have a significant concentration of credit risk with Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, Kindred accounted for $220.9 million, or 51.6% of our total revenues, and $199.1 million, or 59.8% of our total revenues, respectively, and Brookdale Senior Living accounted for $122.7 million, or 28.6% of our total revenues, and $76.2 million, or 22.9% of our total revenues, respectively. Accordingly, the financial condition of Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living and their ability to meet our rent obligations will largely determine our rental revenues and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, any failure by Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities. See "Risk FactorsRisks Arising from Our BusinessWe are dependent on Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living; Kindred's or Brookdale Senior Living's inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could significantly harm us and our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a REIT" included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and "Note 4Concentration of Credit Risk" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We monitor our credit risk under our lease agreements with our tenants by, among other things, (i) reviewing and analyzing information regarding the healthcare industry generally, publicly available information regarding tenants, and information provided by the tenants and borrowers under our lease and other agreements, and (ii) having periodic discussions with tenants, borrowers and their representatives.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
During 2006, our principal sources of liquidity were proceeds from debt issuances, cash flow from operations, borrowings under our unsecured and previous secured revolving credit facilities, proceeds from stock option exercises, and proceeds from the Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. We anticipate that cash flow from operations over the next 12 months will be adequate to fund our business operations, dividends to stockholders and debt amortization. Capital requirements for acquisitions may require funding from borrowings, assumption of debt from the seller, issuance of secured or unsecured long-term debt or other securities or equity offerings.
We intend to continue to fund future investments through cash flow from operations, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, disposition of assets (in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties) and issuance of secured or unsecured long-term debt or other securities. As of December 31, 2006, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 million, escrow deposits and restricted cash of $80.0 million, and unused availability of $442.8 million under our revolving credit facility.
We expect to fund the Sunrise REIT acquisition through a fully committed bridge facility, composed of a $1.0 billion senior interim loan and a $600.0 million senior perpetual preferred stock issuance, and/or some combination of proceeds from asset sales (in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties), borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility, mortgage loans assumptions and other sources.
Revolving Credit Facilities
In April 2006, we entered into a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility"). The Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility replaced our previous $300.0 million secured revolving credit facility. The Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility matures in 2009, with a one-year extension option subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, and contains a $100.0 million "accordion feature" that permits us to increase our total borrowing capacity to $600.0 million. In February 2007, we gave notice of our intention to exercise the full amount of this accordion feature. We anticipate completing this transaction by the end of the first quarter, although there can be no assurance that it will close or, if it does, when the closing will occur.
Generally, borrowings outstanding under the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a fluctuating LIBOR-based rate per annum plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage, initially 0.75%. At December 31, 2006, the applicable percentage was 0.75%. Our previous secured revolving credit facility also bore interest at a fluctuating LIBOR-based rate per annum plus an applicable percentage. The applicable percentage for the previous secured revolving credit facility was 1.45% from January 1, 2006 until its replacement in April 2006.
Convertible Senior Notes
In December 2006, we completed the offering of $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3

% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011 (the "Convertible Notes"). The Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of the holder (i) prior to September 15, 2011, upon the occurrence of specified events and (ii) on or after September 15, 2011, at any time prior to the close of business on the second business day prior to the stated maturity, in each case into cash up to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes and cash or shares of our common stock, at our election, in respect of any conversion value in excess of the principal amount at an initial conversion rate of 22.1867 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which equates to an initial conversion price of approximately $45.07 per share). The initial conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including the payment of a quarterly dividend in excess of $0.395 per share. To the extent the market price of our common stock exceeds $45.07 per share, adjusted downward in the case of quarterly dividends in excess of $0.395 per share, our earnings per share will be diluted.
Pursuant to the registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the Convertible Notes offering, we agreed to file a registration statement covering resales by the holders of shares of our common stock, if any, issued upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. We will not receive any proceeds in connection with any such resales.

The additional $50.0 million aggregate principal amount and the original $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Senior Notes are governed by the same indenture.
In April 2002, we completed the offering of $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8

% Senior Notes due 2009 (the "2009 Senior Notes") of the Issuers, and $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9% Senior Notes due 2012 (the "2012 Senior Notes") of the Issuers. In December 2002, we purchased $0.8 million principal amount of 2009 Senior Notes and $33.2 million principal amount of 2012 Senior Notes in open market transactions.
As of December 31, 2006, $174.2 million principal amount of 2009 Senior Notes, $175.0 million principal amount of 2010 Senior Notes, $191.8 million principal amount of 2012 Senior Notes, $175.0 million principal amount of 2014 Senior Notes, $175.0 million principal amount of 2015 Senior Notes, $200.0 million principal amount of 2016 Senior Notes and $225.0 million principal amount of the 2017 Senior Notes (collectively, the "Senior Notes") were outstanding. We and certain of our subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Senior Notes.
The Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Notes and the Convertible Notes are subject to a number of restrictive covenants. See "Note 8Borrowing Arrangements" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Pursuant to registration rights agreements entered into in connection with the 2010 Senior Notes, 2015 Senior Notes and additional 2014 Senior Notes offerings, on October 28, 2005, we completed offers to exchange the 2010 Senior Notes, 2015 Senior Notes and additional 2014 Senior Notes with new series of notes that are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and are otherwise substantially identical to the original 2010 Senior Notes, 2015 Senior Notes and 2014 Senior Notes, except that certain transfer restrictions, registration rights and liquidated damages do not apply to the new notes. We did not receive any additional proceeds in connection with the exchange offers.
Pursuant to the registration rights agreements entered into in connection with the 2016 Senior Notes offerings, on April 7, 2006, we completed an offer to exchange the 2016 Senior Notes with a new series of notes that are registered under the Securities Act and are otherwise substantially identical to the original 2016 Senior Notes, except that certain transfer restrictions, registration rights and liquidated damages do not apply to the new notes. We did not receive any additional proceeds in connection with the exchange offer.
Dividends
In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gain). We declared dividends greater than 100% of estimated taxable income for 2005 and intend to pay a dividend greater than 100% of taxable income for 2006.
We expect that REIT taxable income will be less than cash flow due to the allowance of depreciation and other non-cash deductions in computing REIT taxable income. Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. If we do not have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, or if we desire to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements.
Capital Expenditures and Property Acquisitions
Except with respect to our medical office buildings and the properties we expect to acquire in connection with our proposed acquisition of Sunrise REIT, assuming the transaction closes (see "Note 18Subsequent Events" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), capital expenditures to maintain and improve our leased properties generally will be incurred by our tenants. Accordingly, we do not believe that we will incur any major expenditures in connection with these leased properties. After the terms of the leases expire, or in the event that the tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under the leases, we anticipate that any expenditures relating to the maintenance of leased properties for which we
 
Table of Contents
may become responsible will be funded by cash flows from operations or through additional borrowings. To the extent that unanticipated expenditures or significant borrowings are required, our liquidity may be affected adversely. Our ability to borrow funds may be restricted in certain circumstances by the terms of the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Convertible Notes and the Senior Notes.
Equity Offerings
In April 2006, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Commission relating to the sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of debt securities and related guarantees, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants. The registration statement replaced our previous universal shelf registration statement, under which approximately $500.0 million of securities remained available for offering.
In July 2005, we completed the sale of 3,247,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to our previous universal shelf registration statement. We received $97.0 million in net proceeds from the sale, which we used to repay indebtedness under our previous secured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions.
In March 2004, we completed the sale of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to our previous universal shelf registration statement. We received $51.1 million in net proceeds from the sale, which we used to repay indebtedness under our previous secured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions.
Other
During 2006 and 2005, we assumed facility-level mortgage debt in connection with certain property acquisitions, including the Senior Care and Provident acquisitions. See "Note 5Acquisitions" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Outstanding facility-level mortgage debt was approximately $734.0 million (of that amount, $114.4 million was repaid in January 2007) and $622.3 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
We received proceeds on the exercises of stock options in the amounts of $6.6 million and $6.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Future proceeds on the exercises of stock options will be primarily affected by the future performance of our stock price and the number of options outstanding. Options outstanding have decreased to 1.1 million as of December 31, 2006, from 1.3 million and 1.6 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
We generated net proceeds from our Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan of $0.8 million and $5.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In March 2005, we began offering a 1% discount on the purchase price of our stock to shareholders who reinvest their dividends and/or make optional cash purchases of common stock through the plan. Each month or quarter, as applicable, we may lower or eliminate the discount without prior notice, thereby affecting the future proceeds that we receive from this plan.
We have outstanding loans to certain current and former executive officers in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $2.5 million as of December 31, 2006, down from $2.8 million at December 31, 2005. The loans are payable over ten years beginning, in each case, on the date such loan was made. See "Note 16Related Party Transactions" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Cash Flows
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $238.9 million and $223.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in 2006 cash flows is primarily a result of increases due to rent escalators and additional rent, net of interest expense, relating to the properties acquired during 2006 and the Rent Reset from the Kindred Master Leases.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $482.0 million. We invested $490.7 million in real property, which was financed through borrowings under the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and our previous secured revolving credit facility, the issuance of the Convertible Notes and $225.0 million of Senior Notes and cash on hand, and proceeds of $9.9 million released from escrow for use in an Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 exchange. Additionally, we invested $191.1 million in real estate loans and received proceeds from our real estate loans of $195.4 million.

We invested $589.6 million in real property, which was financed through borrowings under our previous secured revolving credit facility, the issuance of $400.0 million of Senior Notes, proceeds of $97.0 million from our equity offering and cash on hand, and proceeds of $11.3 million from the sale of facilities, of which $9.9 million was held in escrow for use in an Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 exchange and subsequently released. Additionally, we invested $47.3 million in real estate loans and received proceeds from our real estate loans of $20.3 million.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $242.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, down from $389.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The proceeds included $449.0 million from the issuance of Senior Notes and other debt and $7.5 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and from our Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. The uses primarily included (i) aggregate principal payments on mortgage obligations of $16.1 million, (ii) $160.6 million of cash dividend payments, (iii) payments of deferred financing costs of $4.9 million associated with the issuance of Senior Notes and (iv) net change in borrowings on the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and our previous secured revolving credit facility of $32.2 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $389.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The proceeds included (i) $600.0 million from the issuance of Senior Notes, (ii) $102.0 million from the issuance of common stock, (iii) $50.2 million from net borrowings under our previous secured revolving credit facility and (iv) $6.8 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options. The uses primarily included (i) an aggregate principal payment of $212.6 million on the CMBS loan to fulfill this debt obligation, (ii) aggregate principal payments on other mortgage obligations of $19.4 million, (iii) $125.8 million of cash dividend payments and (iv) a cash payment for the Swap break of $2.3 million.
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes the effect that minimum debt (which includes principal and interest payments) and other material noncancelable commitments are expected to have on our cash flow in the future periods.
 
 
 
 
 
 
In connection with the Kindred spin off, we assigned our former third-party lease obligations and third-party guarantee agreements to Kindred. As of December 31, 2006, we believe that the aggregate exposure under our third-party lease obligations was approximately $18.6 million and that we have no material exposure under the third-party guarantee agreements. Kindred has agreed to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against all claims against us arising out of the third-party leases, and we do not expect to incur any liability under those leases. However, we cannot assure you that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy, or that it will continue to honor its obligations under the indemnity agreement relating to the third-party leases. See "Note 12Commitments and Contingencies" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management of Ventas, Inc. (the "Company") is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
Management, under the supervision of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 was effective. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Therefore, the Company's internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation and may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
Management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on management's assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006.

Ventas, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ventas, Inc. as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Ventas, Inc. at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2006 Ventas, Inc. changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Ventas, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in "Internal Control-Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 16, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Ventas, Inc.
We have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Ventas, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in "Internal ControlIntegrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Ventas, Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, management's assessment that Ventas, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Ventas, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, and our report dated February 16, 2007 (except for Notes 6, 13 and 19 as to which the date is October 10, 2007), expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Note 1Description of Business
Ventas, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or except where the context otherwise requires, "we," "us" or "our") is a healthcare real estate investment trust ("REIT") with a geographically diverse portfolio of seniors housing and healthcare-related properties in the United States. As of December 31, 2006, this portfolio consisted of 172 seniors housing communities, 218 skilled nursing facilities, 43 hospitals and 19 other properties in 43 states. Except with respect to our medical office buildings, we lease these properties to healthcare operating companies under "triple-net" or "absolute net" leases. Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "Kindred") leased 225 of our properties and Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, which include Brookdale Living Communities, Inc. ("Brookdale") and Alterra Healthcare Corporation ("Alterra"), "Brookdale Senior Living") leased 83 of our properties as of December 31, 2006. We also have real estate loan investments relating to seniors housing and healthcare-related third parties as of December 31, 2006.
We conduct substantially all of our business through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership ("Ventas Realty") and PSLT OP, L.P. ("PSLT OP"), and ElderTrust Operating Partnership ("ETOP"), in which we own substantially all of the partnership units. Our primary business consists of financing, owning and leasing seniors housing and healthcare-related properties and leasing or subleasing those properties to third parties.
Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ventas, Inc. and all of its direct and indirect wholly and majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of rental revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Long-Lived Assets
Investments in real estate properties are recorded at cost. We account for acquisitions using the purchase method. The cost of the properties acquired is allocated among tangible land, buildings and equipment and recognized intangibles based upon estimated fair values in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations." We estimate fair values of the components of assets acquired as of the acquisition date or engage a third-party appraiser as necessary. Recognized intangibles, if any, include the value of acquired lease contracts and related customer relationships.
Our method for determining fair value varies with the categorization of the asset acquired. We estimate the fair value of our buildings on an as-if-vacant basis, and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building. We determine the allocated value of other fixed assets based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over their estimated remaining useful lives. We determine the value of land either based on real estate tax assessed values in relation to the total value of the asset, internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio or third-party appraisals. The fair value of in-place leases, if any, reflects (i) above and below market leases, if any, determined by discounting the difference between the estimated current market rent and the in-place rentals, the resulting intangible asset of which is amortized to rental revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any fixed rate renewal periods, if applicable, (ii) the estimated value of the cost to obtain tenants, including tenant allowances, tenant improvements and leasing commissions, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease, and (iii) an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rents and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease-up period, as if the acquired space was vacant, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease. We also estimate the value of tenant or other customer relationships acquired by considering the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with such tenant, such tenant's credit quality, expectations of lease renewals with such tenant, and the potential for significant, additional future leasing arrangements with such tenant. We amortize such value, if any, over the expected term of the associated arrangements or leases, which would include the remaining lives of the related leases and any expected renewal periods.
 
Table of Contents
Fixtures and equipment, with a net book value of $108.8 million and $131.4 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, is included in net real estate property on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Depreciation is recorded on the straight-line basis, using estimated useful lives ranging from 20 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and three to ten years for fixtures and equipment.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, primarily consisting of our investments in real estate, for impairment indicators in accordance with SFAS No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations. We adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long-lived assets to fair value, if the sum of the expected future cash flows and sales proceeds is less than book value. An impairment loss is recognized at the time we make any such determination. Future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted. We did not record any impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.
Loans and Other Amounts Receivable from Third Parties
Loans receivable are stated at the unpaid principal balance net of any deferred origination fees. Net deferred origination fees are comprised of loan fees collected from the borrower net of certain direct costs. Net deferred origination fees are amortized over the contractual life of the loan using the level yield method. Interest income on the loans receivable is recorded as earned. We evaluate the collectibility of loans and other amounts receivable from third parties based on, a number of factors, including (i) corporate and facility-level financial and operational reports, (ii) compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the borrowing or lease agreement (iii) the financial stability of the applicable borrower or tenant and any guarantor and (iv) the payment history of the borrower or tenant. Our level of reserves, if any, for loans and other amounts receivable from third parties fluctuates depending upon all of the factors previously mentioned. No reserves were recorded against our loans receivable balance at December 31, 2006 and 2005.
Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity date of three months or less when purchased. These investments are stated at cost which approximates fair value.
Escrow Deposits and Restricted Cash
Escrow deposits consist of amounts held by lenders or us to provide for future real estate tax and insurance expenditures and tenant improvements. Restricted cash represents amounts committed for security deposits paid to us by third parties and cash restricted due to mortgages insured by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") financing requirements on certain properties.
Deferred Financing Costs
Deferred financing costs are amortized as a component of interest expense over the terms of the related borrowings using a method that approximates a level yield, and are net of accumulated amortization of approximately $7.5 million and $5.9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Approximately $3.3 million of amortized costs were included in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2006, and $3.9 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.
Marketable Equity Securities
We record marketable equity securities as available-for-sale in accordance with SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." These securities are recorded at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in stockholder's equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method and reported in interest and other income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we realized gains of $1.4 million related to the sale of various securities. Proceeds from the sale of the securities were received in January 2007 in the amount of $5.0 million, which was recorded as a receivable in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006. There were no gains or losses realized for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Derivative Instruments
As discussed in "Note 8Borrowing Arrangements," we use derivative instruments to protect against the risk of interest rate movements on future cash flows under our variable rate debt agreements. Derivative instruments are reported at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of derivatives deemed to be eligible for hedge accounting are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income exclusive of ineffectiveness amounts which are reported in interest expense. As of December 31, 2006, a $0.8 million net unrealized gain on the derivatives is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are not eligible for hedge accounting are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See "Note 9Fair Values of Financial Instruments." Fair values of derivative instruments are verified with a third-party consultant.
Fair Values of Financial Instruments
The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating fair value disclosures for financial instruments.
 
 
 
 
 
Revenue Recognition
Certain of our leases, excluding the Kindred Master Leases (as defined below) but including the majority of our leases with Brookdale Senior Living, provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent. Base rental revenues under these leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the applicable lease. Income on our straight-line revenue is recognized when collectibility is reasonably assumed. In the event we determine that collectibility of straight-line revenue is not reasonably assured, we establish an allowance for estimated losses. Recognizing rental income on a straight-line basis results in recognized revenue exceeding cash amounts contractually due from our tenants during the first half of the term for leases that have straight-line treatment. The cumulative excess is included in other assets, net of allowances on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $37.1 million and $17.2 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Certain of our other leases, including the Kindred Master Leases, provide for an annual increase in rental payments only if certain revenue parameters or other contingencies are met. We recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases only if the revenue parameters or other contingencies are met rather than on a straight-line basis over the term of the applicable lease. We recognize income from rent, lease termination fees and other income once all of the following criteria are met in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") Staff Accounting Bulletin 104: (i) the agreement has been fully executed and delivered; (ii) services have been rendered; (iii) the amount is fixed or determinable; and (iv) the collectibility is reasonably assured.
Stock-Based Compensation
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123(R)"), which is a revision to SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS No. 123"). SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB Opinion No. 25"). Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123, except that SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under SFAS No. 123(R). We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006. See "Note 10Stock-Based Compensation."
 
Table of Contents
Gain on Sale of Facilities
We recognize sales of facilities only upon the closing of the transaction with the purchaser. Payments received from purchasers prior to closing are recorded as deposits and classified as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains on facilities sold are recognized using the full accrual method upon closing when the collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured, we are not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale to earn the profit, we have received adequate initial investment from the buyer, and other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied. Gains may be deferred in whole or in part until the sales satisfy the requirements of gain recognition on sales of real estate under SFAS No. 66, "Accounting for Sales of Real Estate."
Federal Income Tax
As we have elected to be treated as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), no provision has been made from federal income tax purposes. See "Note 11Income Taxes."
Discontinued Operations
The results of operations and gain/(loss) on real estate properties sold or held for sale are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income as "discontinued operations" for all periods presented. Interest expense allocated to discontinued operations has been estimated based on a proportional allocation of rental income among all of our properties.
Segment Reporting
We operate through one reportable segment: investment in real estate. Our primary business consists of financing, owning and leasing seniors housing and healthcare-related properties and leasing or subleasing those properties to third parties. Substantially all of our leases are triple-net leases, which require the tenants to pay all property-related expenses. With the exception of our medical office buildings, we do not operate our properties nor do we allocate capital to maintain the properties. Substantially all depreciation and interest expense reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income relate to the ownership of our investment in real estate.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." This statement defines fair value and provides guidance for measuring fair value and the necessary disclosures. This statement does not require any new fair value measurements, but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2008. We have not yet determined the impact, if any, the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement is expected to have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes when it is uncertain how an income or expense item should be treated on an income tax return. FIN 48 describes when an uncertain tax item should be recorded in the financial statements and for how much and provides guidance on recording interest and penalties and accounting and reporting for income taxes in interim periods. FIN 48 was effective beginning January 1, 2007. We are evaluating FIN 48 and have not yet determined the impact the adoption will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
Note 3Revenues from Properties
Approximately 51.6%, 59.8% and 81.5% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, were derived from our four master lease agreements with Kindred (the "Kindred Master Leases").
On June 7, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Provident Senior Living Trust ("Provident") (see "Note 5Acquisitions"), which leased all of its properties to affiliates of Brookdale and Alterra. In September 2005, Brookdale was combined, through a series of mergers, with Alterra under a new holding company, Brookdale Senior Living. As a result of this acquisition, Brookdale Senior Living became a significant source of our total revenues. Approximately 28.6% and 22.9% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were derived from our lease agreements with Brookdale Senior Living.

Kindred Master Leases and Rent Reset Process
Each of the Kindred Master Leases is a triple-net lease pursuant to which Kindred is required to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities, maintenance and repairs related to the properties. The properties leased to Kindred pursuant to the Kindred Master Leases are grouped into renewal bundles, with each bundle containing a varying number of diversified properties. All properties within a bundle have primary terms ranging from ten to 15 years, commencing May 1, 1998, and, provided certain conditions are satisfied, are subject to three five-year renewal terms. Seven bundles containing 64 facilities are scheduled to expire on April 30, 2008 if not renewed by Kindred on or before April 30, 2007. Kindred has stated that "disciplined M&A analysis [is] being applied by Kindred to evaluate each bundle."
Under each Kindred Master Lease, the aggregate annual rent is referred to as Base Rent (as defined in the applicable Kindred Master Lease). Base Rent escalates on May 1 of each year at a specified rate over the Prior Period Base Rent (as defined in the applicable Kindred Master Lease) contingent upon the satisfaction of the specified facility revenue parameters.
On May 9, 2006, we initiated our one-time right under each of the Kindred Master Leases to increase the annual rent on the 225 properties we lease to Kindred to "Fair Market Rental" levels effective July 19, 2006, using a predetermined process described in the Kindred Master Leases.
On October 6, 2006, the final appraisers designated by us and Kindred determined that the aggregate Fair Market Rental for our properties is approximately $239.0 million, representing an annualized increase of $33.1 million over the existing Base Rent under the Kindred Master Leases. The final appraisers also specified that the market annual rent escalator is 2.7% under Kindred Master Leases 1, 3 and 4. Under Kindred Master Lease 2, the annual rent escalation will be based on year-over-year changes in the Consumer Price Index, with a floor of 2.25% and a ceiling of 4%. Annual rental escalations under all of the Kindred Master Leases are contingent upon certain facility revenue parameters being satisfied.
On October 12, 2006, we exercised our election to increase aggregate Base Rent under all four Kindred Master Leases by $33.1 million per year, as determined by the final appraisers, and paid to Kindred a $4.6 million reset fee, as required by the Kindred Master Leases. The $4.6 million reset fee is being amortized on a pro-rata facility-by-facility basis through the end of the facility's initial lease term. Amortization for the period from July 19, 2006 through December 31, 2006 was approximately $0.7 million. Under the terms of the Kindred Master Leases, the new, increased Base Rent was effective as of July 19, 2006, and the revised rent escalators will apply commencing May 1, 2007. During 2006, we recognized $15.0 million in rental income for the additional rent resulting from the Rent Reset under the Kindred Master Leases for the period from July 19, 2006 through December 31, 2006.
In connection with the Rent Reset process, we incurred approximately $7.4 million of one-time costs which we expensed during 2006. These costs included fees of the final appraisers and third party experts, consulting fees and legal fees and expenses. This expense is reflected as rent reset costs on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2006.
Brookdale Senior Living Leases
Each of our leases with subsidiaries of Brookdale Senior Living is a triple-net lease pursuant to which the tenant is required to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities, maintenance and repairs related to the properties. In addition, the tenants are required to comply with the terms of the mortgage financing documents affecting the properties. Our leases with Brookdale have primary terms of 15 years, commencing either January 28, 2004 (in the case of 15 "Grand Court" properties we acquired in early 2004) or October 19, 2004 (in the case of the properties we acquired in connection with the Provident acquisition), and, provided certain conditions are satisfied, are subject to two ten-year renewal terms. Our leases with Alterra also have primary terms of 15 years, commencing either October 20, 2004 or December 16, 2004 (both in the case of properties we acquired in connection with the Provident acquisition), and, provided certain conditions are satisfied, are subject to two five-year renewal terms.
 
Table of Contents
Under the terms of the Brookdale leases assumed in connection with the Provident acquisition, Brookdale is obligated to pay base rent, which escalates on January 1 of each year, by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) four times the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index during the immediately preceding year or (ii) 3%. Under the terms of the Brookdale leases with respect to the "Grand Court" properties, Brookdale is obligated to pay base rent, which escalates on February 1 of each year, by an amount equal to the greater of (i) 2% or (ii) 75% of the increase in the Consumer Price Index during the immediately preceding year. Under the terms of the Alterra leases, Alterra is obligated to pay base rent, which escalates either on January 1 or November 1 of each year by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) four times the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index during the immediately preceding year or (ii) 2.5%. We recognize rent revenue under the Brookdale and Alterra leases on a straight-line basis. See "Note 12Commitments and Contingencies."
The future contracted minimum rentals, excluding contingent rent escalations, but with straight-line rents where applicable, for all of our leases are as follows (table has not been updated to reflect discontinued operations treatment for properties sold during the first six months of 2007):
 
Note 4Concentration of Credit Risk
As of December 31, 2006, approximately 27.4% and 37.4% of our properties, based on their original cost, were operated by Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living, respectively, and approximately 62.8% and 25.7% of our properties, based on their original cost, were seniors housing properties and skilled nursing facilities, respectively. Our remaining properties consist of hospitals, medical office buildings and other properties. Our properties are located in 43 states, with properties in two states accounting for more than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2004, properties in only one state accounted for more than 10% of total revenues.
Because we lease a substantial portion of our properties to Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living and Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living are the primary source of our total revenues, their financial condition and ability and willingness to satisfy their obligations under their respective leases and certain other agreements with us will significantly impact our revenues and our ability to service our indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. We cannot assure you that Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations under its respective leases and other agreements with us, and any inability or unwillingness or its part to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, on our ability to service our indebtedness and on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders as required to maintain our status as a REIT.
Note 5Acquisitions
The following is a summary of our more significant acquisitions in 2006, 2005 and 2004. The primary reason for these acquisitions was to invest in seniors housing and healthcare properties with an expected yield on investment, as well as to diversify our properties and revenue base and reduce our dependence on Kindred for rental revenue.
Senior Care
On November 7, 2006, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of VSCRE Holdings, LLC ("VSCRE") and all of the issued and outstanding beneficial interests of IPC AL Real Estate Investment Trust ("IPC") in a transaction with SCRE Investments, Inc. ("SCRE") and IPC Equity Holdings Limited. The aggregate consideration for the transaction was $602.4 million, consisting of approximately $422.6 million in cash, the assumption of $114.8 million of mortgage debt that was repaid in January 2007 and 1,708,279 shares of our common stock.
 
Table of Contents
IPC and VSCRE, an entity recently formed for the purpose of acquiring real estate assets prior to its acquisition by us, consist of a portfolio of 64 senior care properties, comprised of four separate asset groups previously owned by 14 different predecessor entities. As a result of the consummation of the transaction, we, through IPC and VSCRE, acquired 40 assisted living communities, four multi-level retirement communities, 18 skilled nursing facilities and two rehabilitation hospitals in 15 states.
Following the acquisition of IPC and VSCRE, the 64 properties are being leased to affiliates of Senior Care, Inc. ("Senior Care"), an affiliate of SCRE, pursuant to the terms of a triple-net master lease having an initial term of 15 years and two five-year extensions. The tenants' obligations under the master lease are guaranteed, directly or indirectly, by the tenants' parent, Senior Care Operations Holdings, LLC, and its parent, Senior Care. At December 31, 2006, the aggregate annualized contractual cash rent expected from the Senior Care properties was $46.8 million.
In connection with this acquisition, we have committed to purchase two additional assisted living communities for approximately $18.5 million subject to approval of HUD of the loan assumptions by us relating to $9.0 million of mortgage debt encumbering those assets and satisfaction of certain other conditions. We expect to acquire these two assets in the first half of 2007.
Other 2006 Acquisitions
During 2006, we acquired eight seniors housing communities in five separate transactions for an aggregate purchase price of $74.3 million, including assumed debt of $10.8 million at the time of the acquisitions. The seniors housing communities are leased under triple-net leases, each having initial terms ranging from ten to 15 years and initially providing aggregate, annual cash base rent of approximately $6.2 million, subject to escalation as provided in the leases.
Provident
On June 7, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Provident in a transaction valued at approximately $1.2 billion. Provident was formed as a Maryland real estate investment trust in March 2004 and owned seniors living properties located in the United States. Pursuant to the Provident acquisition, we acquired 68 independent and assisted living facilities in 19 states comprised of approximately 6,819 residential living units, all of which are leased to affiliates of Brookdale and Alterra pursuant to triple-net leases with renewal options. As of December 31, 2006, the aggregate annualized contractual cash rent expected from the Provident properties was approximately $89.2 million.
We funded the cash portion of the purchase price for the Provident acquisition, which was approximately $231.0 million, and repaid all outstanding borrowings under Provident's credit facility at closing from a combination of net proceeds from the sale of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued by Ventas Realty and a wholly owned subsidiary, Ventas Capital Corporation (collectively, the "Issuers"), and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Additionally, we issued approximately 15.0 million shares of our common stock and share equivalents to Provident equity holders as part of the purchase price for the Provident acquisition. We also assumed approximately $459.4 million of property-level mortgage debt.
Other 2005 Acquisitions
During 2005, we acquired 23 seniors housing communities, an adjacent parcel of land and one hospital for an aggregate purchase price of $278.2 million, including assumed debt of $74.4 million at the time of the acquisitions. The seniors housing communities and the hospital are leased under triple-net leases, each having initial terms ranging from ten to 15 years and initially providing aggregate, annual cash base rent of approximately $23.9 million, subject to escalation as provided in the leases.
Also during 2005, we acquired three medical office buildings for an aggregate purchase price of $13.0 million, including assumed debt of $7.3 million at the time of the acquisitions. These buildings are leased to various tenants under leases having various remaining terms and initially providing aggregate, annual cash base rent of approximately $1.7 million, subject to escalation as provided in the leases. We have engaged third parties to manage the operations of the medical office buildings.
2004 Acquisitions
In February 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of ElderTrust in an all-cash transaction valued at $184.0 million. At the close of the ElderTrust transaction, ElderTrust had approximately $33.5 million in unrestricted and restricted cash. After transaction costs, the net investment of the ElderTrust transaction was approximately $160.0 million. The ElderTrust transaction added 18 properties to our portfolio. The ElderTrust properties are leased to various operators under leases having remaining terms at the time of the acquisition primarily ranging from four to 11 years and initially
 
Table of Contents
providing aggregate, annual cash base rent of approximately $16.4 million, subject to escalation as provided in the leases. Concurrent with the consummation of the ElderTrust transaction, we also purchased all of the limited partnership units in ETOP then held by third parties at $12.50 per unit, other than 31,455 Class C Units in ETOP (which remain outstanding). ETOP owns directly or indirectly all of the ElderTrust properties.
During 2004, we acquired 15 independent and assisted living properties for an aggregate purchase price of $157.4 million. We lease these properties to affiliates of Brookdale pursuant to a master lease containing ten properties and five separate single property leases, all of which are triple-net leases guaranteed by Brookdale having an initial term of 15 years and initially providing aggregate, annual cash base rent of approximately $14.5 million, subject to escalation as provided in the leases.
Additionally, during 2004 we acquired four seniors housing communities and two skilled nursing facilities for an aggregate purchase price of $93.3 million. The properties are leased under triple-net leases, having initial terms of ten to 15 years and providing aggregate, annual cash base rent of approximately $8.9 million, subject to escalation as provided in the leases.
We also acquired five medical office buildings, for an aggregate purchase price of $15.9 million. These buildings are leased to various tenants under leases having remaining terms ranging from four to six years and initially providing for aggregate, annual cash base rent of approximately $1.9 million, subject to escalation as provided in the leases. We have engaged third parties to manage the operations of the medical office buildings.
Estimated Fair Value
The transactions completed during the year ended December 31, 2006 were accounted for under the purchase method. The following table summarizes the preliminary estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. Such estimates are subject to refinement as additional valuation information is received.

Note 6Dispositions
Pursuant to SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", we present separately, as discontinued operations, in all periods the results of operations for all assets disposed of on or after January 1, 2002. Results are reflective of dispositions through June 30, 2007.
On June 30, 2007, we completed the sale of 22 facilities to Kindred. We did not make any dispositions during the year ended December 31, 2006. In 2005, we completed the sale of one seniors housing property for approximately $9.9 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a net gain on sale of approximately $5.1 million. In addition, the tenant paid us a lease termination fee of approximately $0.2 million. These net proceeds were held in escrow for use in an Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 exchange at December 31, 2005 and released back to us during 2006, as no like-kind exchange was consummated. In 2004, we completed the sale of two facilities for $21.1 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a net gain on the sale of $19.4 million. In addition, the tenant paid us lease termination fees approximating $0.5 million.
 
Table of Contents
The components of discontinued operations are outlined below and include the results of operations for the respective periods that we owned such assets during each of the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.
 
For the properties sold during the first six months of 2007, the investment in real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, at December 31, 2006 was $42.9 million.
 
Note 7Loans Receivable
During 2005, we extended three first mortgage loans in the aggregate principal amount of $25.9 million. The loans accrue interest at a rate of 9% per annum and provide for monthly amortization of principal with balloon payment maturity dates ranging from February to April 2010. Each loan is guaranteed by an affiliate of the borrower and its two principals.
Also during 2005, we invested in a portfolio of eight distressed mortgage loans with eight separate borrowers for an aggregate purchase price of $21.4 million. As of December 31, 2005, our investment in the portfolio was satisfied by the buy-out of the applicable distressed mortgage loans in an amount equal to our investment in these loans. In conjunction with these buy-outs, we extended three first mortgage loans in an aggregate principal amount of $10.5 million. The new first mortgage loans accrue interest at a rate of 9% per annum and provide for monthly amortization of principal with balloon payment maturity dates ranging from July to December 2010. These three first mortgage loans are also guaranteed by a third party and its two principals.
Our six first mortgage loans have a 1% exit fee that was received at the date of issuance and is being deferred and amortized over the term of the loan. The aggregate unamortized balance of these deferred fees as of December 31, 2006 was $0.3 million.

Note 8Borrowing Arrangements
The following is a summary of our long-term debt and certain interest rate and maturity information as of December 31, 2006 and 2005:
 
Revolving Credit Facilities
In April 2006, we entered into a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility"). The Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility replaced our previous $300.0 million secured revolving credit facility. The Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility matures in 2009, with a one-year extension option subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, and contains a $100.0 million "accordion feature" that permits us to increase our total borrowing capacity to $600.0 million. In February 2007, we gave notice of our intention to exercise the full amount of this accordion feature.
Generally, borrowings outstanding under the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a fluctuating LIBOR-based rate per annum plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage, initially 0.75%. The applicable percentage at December 31, 2006 was 0.75%. Our previous secured revolving credit facility also bore interest at a fluctuating LIBOR-based rate per annum plus an applicable percentage. The applicable percentage for the previous secured revolving credit facility was 1.45% from January 1, 2006 until its replacement in April 2006.
We incurred losses on extinguishment of debt in the amount of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $1.4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, representing the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the previous secured revolving credit facility, our commercial mortgage backed securities ("CMBS") loan and another revolving credit facility replaced by our previous $300.0 million secured revolving credit facility in September 2004.
Convertible Senior Notes
In December 2006, we completed the offering of $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3

% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011 (the "Convertible Notes"). The Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of the holder (i) prior to September 15, 2011, upon the occurrence of specified events and (ii) on or after September 11, 2011, at any time prior to the close of business on the second business day prior to the stated maturity, in each case into cash up to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes and cash or shares of our common stock, at our election, in respect of any conversion value in excess of the principal amount at an initial conversion rate of 22.1867 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which equates to an initial conversion price of approximately $45.07 per share). The initial conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including the payment of a quarterly dividend in excess of $0.395 per share. To the extent the market price of our common stock exceeds $45.07 per share, adjusted downward in the case of quarterly dividends in excess of $0.395 per share, our earnings per share will be diluted. There was no dilutive impact for the year ended December 31, 2006.
 
Table of Contents
The Convertible Notes are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by Ventas Realty and by certain of our other direct and indirect subsidiaries as described in the indenture. The Convertible Notes are part of our and the guarantors' general unsecured obligations, ranking equal in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors' existing and future senior obligations and ranking senior to all of our and the guarantors' existing and future subordinated indebtedness. However, the Convertible Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the guarantors' secured indebtedness, if any, to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness. The Convertible Notes are also structurally subordinated to the preferred equity and indebtedness, whether secured or unsecured, of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Convertible Notes.
We may not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to maturity except to the extent necessary to preserve our status as a REIT.
If we experience certain kinds of changes of control, holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Convertible Notes for cash at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
Senior Notes
In September 2006, we completed the offering of $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6

In December 2002, we purchased $0.8 million principal amount of 2009 Senior Notes and $33.2 million principal amount of 2012 Senior Notes in open market transactions.
The 2017 Senior Notes, 2016 Senior Notes, 2010 Senior Notes, 2015 Senior Notes, 2014 Senior Notes, 2009 Senior Notes, and 2012 Senior Notes (collectively, the "Senior Notes") are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by us and by certain of our current and future subsidiaries as described in their respective indentures (collectively, the "Guarantors"). The Senior Notes are part of our and the Guarantors' general unsecured obligations, ranking equal in right of payment with all of our and the Guarantors' existing and future senior obligations and ranking senior to all of our and the Guarantors' existing and future subordinated indebtedness. However, the Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the Guarantors' secured indebtedness, if any, to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness. The Senior Notes are also structurally subordinated to the preferred equity and indebtedness, whether secured or unsecured, of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes.
The Issuers may redeem the 2017 Senior Notes, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, (i) prior to April 1, 2012 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium as described in the applicable indenture and (ii) on or after April 1, 2012 at varying redemption prices set forth in the applicable indenture, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. In addition, at any time prior to April 1, 2010, the Issuers may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Senior Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 106.750% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.
The Issuers may redeem the 2016 Senior Notes, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, (i) prior to June 1, 2011 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium as described in the applicable indenture and (ii) on or after June 1, 2011 at varying redemption prices set forth in the applicable indenture, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. In addition, at any time prior to June 1, 2009, the Issuers may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Senior Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 106.500% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.

If we experience certain kinds of changes of control, the Issuers must make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase; provided, however, that in the event Moody's and S&P have confirmed their ratings at Ba3 or higher and BB- or higher on the Senior Notes and certain other conditions are met, this repurchase obligation will not apply.
Mortgages
At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding 53 mortgage loans that we assumed in connection with various acquisitions. Outstanding principal balances on these loans ranged from $0.4 million to $114.4 million as of December 31, 2006. The loans bear interest at fixed rates ranging from 5.6% to 8.5% per annum, except with respect to eight loans with outstanding principal balances ranging from $0.4 million to $114.4 million, which bear interest at the lender's variable rates, ranging from 3.6% to 8.5% per annum at of December 31, 2006. The fixed rate debt bears interest at a weighted average annual rate of 7.06% and the variable rate debt bears interest at a weighted average annual rate of 5.61% as of December 31, 2006. The loans had a weighted average maturity of eight years as of December 31, 2006. The $114.4 variable mortgage debt was repaid in January 2007.
Scheduled Maturities of Borrowing Arrangements and Other Provisions
As of December 31, 2006, our indebtedness has the following maturities (in thousands):
 
Certain provisions of our long-term debt contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) incur debt; (ii) make certain dividends, distributions and investments; (iii) enter into certain transactions; (iv) merge, consolidate or transfer certain assets; and (v) sell assets. We and certain of our subsidiaries are also required to maintain total unencumbered assets of at least 150% of this group's unsecured debt.

Derivatives and Hedging
In the normal course of business, we are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes. We limit these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives. For interest rate exposures, derivatives are used primarily to fix the rate on debt based on floating-rate indices and to manage the cost of borrowing obligations. We currently have an interest rate swap to manage interest rate risk (the "Swap"). We prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, we have a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivative is designed to hedge, we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives.
In 2001, we entered into the Swap in the original notional amount of $450.0 million to hedge floating-rate debt for the period between July 1, 2003 and June 30 2008, under which we pay a fixed rate at 5.385% and receive LIBOR from the counterparty to the agreement. The Swap is treated as a cash flow hedge. In 2003 and 2005, due to our lower expected future variable rate debt balances, we reduced the notional amount of the Swap to $330.0 million and then to $100.0 million for its remaining term in exchange for payments from us of approximately $8.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively. The $2.3 million partial swap breakage cost and $3.3 million of the deferred gain were recognized as a net gain of $1.0 million in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Amortization of the deferred gain from the termination of a swap arrangement before the Swap is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the amounts of $0.7 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, the remaining deferred gain in accumulated other comprehensive income was $0.7 million, which will continue to be amortized through December 2007.
Unrealized gains and losses on the Swap are recorded as other comprehensive income. The amounts reclassified into interest expense due to the swaps for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $0.3 million, $6.9 million and $13.3 million, respectively. Assuming no changes in interest rates, we estimate that approximately $0.7 million of the current balance recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized as interest income within the next 12 months consistent with historical reporting. For the year ended December 31, 2004, $0.5 million of the unrealized loss on the swaps previously reported in accumulated other comprehensive income was reclassified to interest expense to reflect the excess of the notional amount of the swaps over the anticipated variable rate debt balances in the future. No amount was reflected as interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, as we anticipated our variable rate debt balances to approximate the $100.0 million notional amount of the Swap.
There are no collateral requirements under the Swap. Although we are exposed to credit loss in the event of the non-performance by the counterparty to the Swap, we do not anticipate any such non-performance. The notional amount of the Swap at December 31, 2006 was $100.0 million, which is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2008.
At December 31, 2006, the Swap was reported at its fair value of $0.4 million and is included in other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The offsetting entry is reported as a deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
Note 9Fair Values of Financial Instruments
As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the carrying amounts and fair values of our financial instruments were as follows:
 
Fair value estimates are subjective in nature and depend on a number of important assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows, risks, discount rates and relevant comparable market information associated with each financial instrument. The use of different market assumptions and estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts. Accordingly, the estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we would realize in a current market exchange.

Note 10Stock-Based Compensation
Compensation Plans
We have six plans under which options to purchase common stock and/or shares of restricted stock have been, or may be, granted to officers, employees and non-employee directors, one plan under which executive officers may receive common stock in lieu of compensation and two plans under which certain directors may receive common stock in lieu of director fees (the following are collectively referred to as the "Plans"): (1) the 1987 Incentive Compensation Program (Employee Plan); (2) the 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan (Employee Plan); (3) the 2004 Stock Plan for Directors; (4) the TheraTx, Incorporated 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan; (5) the Executive Deferred Stock Compensation Plan; (6) the Common Stock Purchase Plan for Directors (the "Directors Stock Purchase Plan"); (7) the Nonemployee Director Deferred Stock Compensation Plan; (8) the 2006 Incentive Plan; and (9) the 2006 Stock Plan for Directors.
During the year ended December 31, 2006, option and restricted stock grants and stock issuances could only be made under the 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan (Employee Plan), the Executive Deferred Stock Compensation Plan, the 2004 Stock Plan for Directors, the Directors Stock Purchase Plan, the Nonemployee Director Deferred Stock Compensation Plan, the 2006 Incentive Plan and the 2006 Stock Plan for Directors. The 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan (Employee Plan) and the 2004 Stock Plan for Directors expired on December 31, 2006, and no additional grants are permitted under those plans after that date. Additional grants are also not permitted under the 1987 Incentive Compensation Program (Employee Plan) or the TheraTx, Incorporated 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan.
The number of shares reserved and the number of shares available for future grants or issuance under these plans as of December 31, 2006 are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
Under the Plans (other than the Executive Deferred Stock Compensation Plan, the Directors Stock Purchase Plan and the Nonemployee Director Deferred Stock Compensation Plan), options are exercisable at the market price on the date of grant, expire ten years from the date of grant, and vest over varying periods ranging from one to four years. As of December 31, 2006, options for 1,118,051 shares had been granted to eligible participants and remained outstanding under the Plans.
We have also granted options and restricted stock to certain officers, employees and non-employee directors outside of the Plans. These options and shares of restricted stock vest over varying periods, and the options are exercisable at the market price on the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant. As of December 31, 2006, options for 38,000 shares had been granted outside of the Plans to certain employees and non-employee directors and remained outstanding.
No additional grants are permitted under the 1987 Incentive Compensation Program (Employee Plan), the TheraTx, Incorporated 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan, the 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan (Employee Plan) or the 2004 Stock Plan for Directors. As a result, the shares reserved under these Plans equal the options outstanding under such Plans.
Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for the Plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, as permitted by SFAS No. 123. Consequently, no stock-based compensation cost relating to stock options was recognized in our consolidated statement of income for any period prior to 2006, as all options granted under the Plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value provisions for share-based awards pursuant to SFAS No. 123(R), using the modified-prospective transition method. Under that transition method, compensation cost recognized in 2006 includes:
 
Table of Contents
(i) compensation cost for all share-based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the attribution method and grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (ii) compensation cost for all share-based awards granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value as estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), all recognized on a straight-line basis as the requisite service periods are rendered. Results for prior periods have not been restated.
The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 caused our net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 to be approximately $931,000 lower than if we had continued to account for stock-based compensation under APB Opinion No. 25. The adoption caused basic and diluted earnings per share to be $0.01 lower for the year ended December 31, 2006.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) to all stock-based compensation granted under equity award plans for awards granted prior to January 1, 2006 (in thousands, except per share amounts):
 
We granted 262,375, 70,127 and 68,271 shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The market value of shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units on the date of the award is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the service period, with charges to operations of approximately $1.5 million in 2006 and $1.2 million in each of 2005 and 2004. As required upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the contra equity balance in unearned compensation on restricted stock of approximately $713,000 as of January 1, 2006 was reclassified (i.e. netted against capital in excess of par value) in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006.
Stock Options
In determining the estimated fair value of our stock options as of the date of grant, we used the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:
 
The Black-Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in our opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options.

A summary of the status of our nonvested stock options as of December 31, 2006, and changes during the year ended December 31, 2006 follows:
 
As of December 31, 2006, there was $367,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options granted under the Plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.6 years. The total fair value of shares vested during the year ended December 31, 2006 was $886,000.
Employee and Director Stock Purchase Plan
During 2005, we implemented the Ventas Employee and Director Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") under which our employees and directors may purchase shares of our common stock at a discount. Pursuant to the terms of the ESPP, on each purchase date, participants may purchase shares of common stock at a price not less than 90% of the market price on that date, with respect to the employee tax-favored portion of the plan, and not less than 95% of the market price on that date, with respect to the additional employee and director portion of the plan. We have reserved 2,500,000 shares for issuance under the ESPP. As of December 31, 2006, 12,009 shares had been purchased under the ESPP and 2,487,991 shares were available for future issuance.
Employee Benefit Plan
We maintain a 401(K) plan that allows for eligible employees to defer compensation subject to certain limitations imposed by the Code. We make a contribution for each qualifying employee of up to 3% of his or her salary, subject to limitations, regardless of the employee's individual contribution. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, our contributions were approximately $85,600, $78,000 and $62,300, respectively.
Note 11Income Taxes
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code commencing with the year ended December 31, 1999. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to enable us to qualify as a REIT. Our actual qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, distribution levels, stock ownership, and the various qualification tests. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, our tax treatment of distributions was as follows:
 
No net provision for income taxes has been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 due to our belief that we qualified as a REIT and the distribution of more than 100% of our 2006, 2005 and 2004 taxable income as a dividend.
 
Table of Contents
We believe we have met the annual distribution requirement by payment of at least 90% of our estimated taxable income for 2006, 2005 and 2004.
Net taxable income for federal income tax purposes results from net income for financial reporting purposes adjusted for the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, including depreciation, prepaid rent, impairment losses on real estate and the interest rate swap agreement. The net difference between tax bases and the reported amount of our assets and liabilities for federal income tax purposes was approximately $446.4 million and $489.5 million less than the book bases of those assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
We made no income tax payments for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.
We potentially remain subject to corporate level taxes for any asset dispositions during the ten-year period immediately after the assets were owned by a C corporation (either prior to our REIT election, through stock acquisition or merger) ("built-in gains tax"). The amount of income potentially subject to this special corporate level tax is generally equal to the lesser of (i) the excess of the fair value of the asset over its adjusted tax basis as of the date it became a REIT asset or (ii) the actual amount of gain. Some but not all future gains could be offset by available net operating losses ("NOLs"). The deferred income tax liability of $30.4 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005 reflects a previously established liability to be utilized for any built-in gains tax incurred.
In 2003, we reported an increase of approximately $20.2 million to our operating results, reflecting the reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability. This contingent liability was previously recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet to take into account the uncertainties surrounding the outcome of the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") audit for our 1997 and 1998 tax periods as well as other federal, state, local, franchise and miscellaneous tax items.
During 2006, we were notified by the IRS that it had completed its audit of our 2001 federal tax return with no additional tax being due. Accordingly, we reversed into income a previously recorded $1.8 million tax liability related to uncertainties surrounding the outcome of this audit.
We have an NOL carryforward of $88.6 million at December 31, 2006. This amount can be used to offset future taxable income (and/or taxable income for prior years if audits of any prior year's return determine that amounts are owed), if any, remaining after the dividends paid deduction. We will be entitled to utilize NOLs and tax credit carryforwards only to the extent that REIT taxable income exceeds our deduction for dividends paid. The NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2018.
As a result of the uncertainties relating to the ultimate utilization of existing NOLs, no net deferred tax benefit has been ascribed to NOL carryforwards as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. The IRS may challenge our entitlement to these tax attributes during its review of the tax returns for the previous tax years. We believe we are entitled to these tax attributes, but we cannot assure you as to the outcome of these matters.
Note 12Commitments and Contingencies
Assumption of Certain Operating Liabilities and Litigation
In connection with our spin off of Kindred in 1998, Kindred agreed, among other things, to assume all liabilities and to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against certain losses, claims and litigation arising out of the ownership or operation of the healthcare operations or any of the assets transferred to Kindred in the spin off, including without limitation all claims arising out of the third-party leases and third-party guarantees assigned to and assumed by Kindred at the time of the spin off. Under Kindred's plan of reorganization, Kindred assumed and agreed to fulfill these obligations. The total aggregate remaining minimum rental payments under the third-party leases was approximately $18.6 million as of December 31, 2006 and we believe that we had no material exposure under the third-party guarantees.
Similarly, in connection with Provident's acquisition of certain Brookdale-related and Alterra-related entities in 2005 and our subsequent acquisition of Provident, Brookdale and Alterra agreed, among other things, to indemnify and hold Provident (and, as a result of the Provident acquisition, us) harmless from and against certain liabilities arising out of the ownership or operation of such entities prior to their acquisition by Provident.
There can be no assurance that Kindred, Brookdale and Alterra will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to satisfy, or that they will be willing to satisfy, their respective obligations under these arrangements. If Kindred, Brookdale or Alterra does not satisfy or otherwise honor its obligations to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless under its respective contractual arrangements with us, then we may be liable for the payment and performance of such obligations and may have to assume the defense of such claims or litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and liquidity, on our ability to service our indebtedness and on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders as required to maintain our status as a REIT.

Brookdale Leases
Subject to certain limitations and restrictions, if during the first six years of the initial term of our Brookdale leases assumed in connection with the Provident acquisition we, either voluntarily or at Brookdale's request, obtain new mortgage debt or refinance existing mortgage debt on property covered by a Brookdale lease, then we may be required to pay Brookdale the net proceeds from any such mortgage debt financing or refinancing. Also, subject to certain limitations and conditions, Brookdale may request that we obtain new mortgage debt or refinance existing mortgage debt on the property covered by the Brookdale leases, and we have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue any such financing or refinancing from the holder of the then existing mortgage debt on the applicable Brookdale property. In connection with any such financing or refinancing, the rent for the applicable Brookdale property will be increased using a recomputed lease basis increased by an amount equal to the net financed proceeds paid to Brookdale plus any fees, penalties, premiums or other costs related to such financing or refinancing. In addition, if the monthly debt service on any financed or refinanced proceeds paid to Brookdale exceeds the rent increase attributable to those financed or refinanced proceeds, then Brookdale is required to pay the excess. In addition, under certain circumstances, Brookdale will also be required to pay additional amounts relating to increases in debt service and other costs relating to any such financing or refinancing.

Note 14Litigation
Legal Proceedings Defended and Indemnified by Third Parties
On September 29, 2006, the Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed the Circuit Court's dismissal with prejudice of the stockholder derivative suit entitled Case No. 98 C103669, originally filed in June 1998 in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Kentucky. The plaintiff in the suit sought unspecified damages, interest, punitive damages, reasonable attorneys' fees, other costs and any extraordinary equitable and/or injunctive relief permitted by law or equity, alleging, among other things, that certain former officers and directors damaged our company by engaging in breaches of fiduciary duty, insider trading, fraud and securities fraud and damaging our reputation. Pursuant to agreements we entered into with Kindred at the time of our spin off of Kindred, Kindred assumed the defense, on our behalf, of and has indemnified us for any fees, costs, expenses and liabilities related to this matter. No provision for liability resulting from this litigation has been made in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2006.
Thomas G. White on behalf of Ventas, Inc. v. W. Bruce Lunsford, et al.,
Kindred, Brookdale, Alterra and our other tenants and operators are also parties to certain legal actions and regulatory investigations arising in the normal course of their business. In certain cases, the tenant or operator has agreed to indemnity, defend and hold us harmless against these actions and investigations. There can be no assurance that the resolution of any litigation or investigations, either individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on Kindred's, Brookdale's, Alterra's or such other tenants' and operators' liquidity, financial position or results of operations, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us.
Kindred Litigation
On June 19, 2006, Kindred filed a lawsuit against us in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, entitled , Index No. 602137-06, seeking immediate declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent us from terminating the Kindred Master Leases based on Kindred's refusal to deliver all appraisal reports in Kindred's control or possession relating to the 225 facilities we lease to Kindred. The suit alleges, among other things, that the terms of the Kindred Master Leases do not entitle us to receive the appraisal reports and, therefore, Kindred's failure to disclose those reports does not enable us to exercise our rights and remedies under the Kindred Master Leases, including termination as to one or more facilities thereunder. On July 20, 2006, the Court issued an order denying Kindred's motions for a preliminary injunction or other injunctive relief. The Court order directed Kindred to supply to us all documents that Kindred produced to its appraisers, directed Kindred to produce other information, including its inter-company pharmacy and therapy contracts, and directed Kindred's appraisers to create an inventory of all documents used in the appraisal reports and deliver the documents and inventories to us. The Court did not order Kindred to turn over any of the appraiser reports, noting that we would receive them as part of the rent reset process. We filed a protective appeal of the July 20, 2006 order to the extent that the order is construed incorrectly as determining on the merits that Kindred was not required to provide the appraisal reports under the Kindred Master Leases. On August 4, 2006, the Court granted our motion to dismiss the lawsuit, but retained jurisdiction to enforce the Court's order requiring Kindred to produce certain information. We filed a protective appeal of the August 4, 2006 order on the same grounds as our appeal of the July 20, 2006 order. Kindred has also appealed the August 4, 2006 order. On September 5, 2006, we filed a motion contending that Kindred had failed to provide the information required in the Court's previous orders and seeking appropriate relief. On September 27, 2006, the Court ruled from the bench that Kindred had not produced the required information, including information about its pharmaceutical sales profits, and ordered that Kindred turn over the information. No briefs or substantive pleadings have been filed in connection with the appeal. No provision for liability, if any, resulting from this litigation has been made in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2006.
Kindred Healthcare, Inc. and Kindred Operating, Inc. v. Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership
Other Litigation
We are a plaintiff in an action seeking a declaratory judgment and damages entitled , Case No. 99 C107076, filed November 22, 1999 in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Kentucky. Two of the three defendants in that action, Black Diamond International Funding, Ltd. and BDC Finance, LLC (collectively "Black Diamond"), have asserted counterclaims against us under theories of breach of contract, tortious interference with contract and abuse of process. We dispute the material allegations contained in Black Diamond's counterclaims and we intend to continue to pursue its claims and defend the counterclaims vigorously. We are unable at this time to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for the counterclaims in this action, and therefore, no provision for liability, if any, resulting from this litigation has been made in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2006.
Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership et al. v. Black Diamond CLO 1998-1 Ltd., et al.
During 2005, we settled the action entitled Case No. 02-5232, filed by us in June 2002 in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. The complaint asserted claims of legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty by Sullivan & Cromwell in connection with its legal representation of us in our spin off of Kindred. Under the terms of the settlement, a $25.5 million payment was made to us on behalf of Sullivan & Cromwell in 2005. After payment

of expenses for this action, including the contingent fee for our outside legal counsel, we received approximately $15.9 million in net proceeds from the settlement, which we used to establish a charitable foundation, to repay debt and for other corporate purposes.
We are party to various other lawsuits arising in the normal course of our business. It is the opinion of management that, except as set forth in this Note 14, the disposition of these lawsuits will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on us. If management's assessment of our liability with respect to these actions is incorrect, such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on us.
Note 15Capital Stock
The authorized capital stock at December 31, 2006 and 2005 consisted of 180,000,000 shares of common stock, par value of $0.25 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share, of which 65,000 shares have been designated as Series A Preferred Stock and 300,000 shares have been designated Series A Participating Preferred Stock.
In April 2006, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Commission relating to the sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of debt securities and related guarantees, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants. The registration statement replaced our previous universal shelf registration statement, under which approximately $500.0 million of securities remained available for offering.
In July 2005, we completed the sale of 3,247,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to our previous universal shelf registration statement. We received $97.0 million in net proceeds from the sale, which we used to repay indebtedness under our previous secured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions.
In March 2004, we completed the sale of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to our previous universal shelf registration statement. We received $51.1 million in net proceeds from the sale, which we used to repay indebtedness under our previous secured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions.
Excess Share Provision
In order to preserve our ability to maintain REIT status, our Certificate of Incorporation provides that if a person acquires beneficial ownership of greater than 9% of our outstanding common stock or 9.9% of our outstanding preferred stock, the shares that are beneficially owned in excess of such limit are deemed to be excess shares. These shares are automatically deemed transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable institution or other qualifying organization selected by our Board of Directors. The trust is entitled to all dividends with respect to the shares and the trustee may exercise all voting power over the shares.
We have the right to buy the excess shares for a purchase price equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that created the excess shares, or (ii) the market price on the date we buy the shares, and we may defer payment of the purchase price for the excess shares for up to five years. If we do not purchase the excess shares, the trustee of the trust is required to transfer the excess shares at the direction of the Board of Directors. The owner of the excess shares is entitled to receive the lesser of the proceeds from the sale of the excess shares or the original purchase price for such excess shares; any additional amounts are payable to the beneficiary of the trust.
The Board of Directors is empowered to grant waivers from the excess share provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation. In June 2003, we granted a waiver (the "C&S Waiver") from the 9% ownership limitation provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation to Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. ("C&S"). Under the C&S Waiver, C&S may beneficially own, in the aggregate, up to 14% in number of shares or value of our common stock.
Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan
We have a Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. Under the plan's terms, existing stockholders may purchase shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of the cash distribution on their shares of our common stock. In addition, existing stockholders, as well as new investors, may purchase shares of common stock by making optional cash payments. In March 2005, we began offering a 1% discount on the purchase price of our stock to shareholders who reinvest their dividends and/or make optional cash purchases of common stock through the plan. In 2004, we offered a 2% discount on the purchase price of our stock to shareholders that participated in the plan. The availability of a market discount is at our discretion. The granting of a discount for one month or quarter, as applicable, will not insure the availability of a discount or the same discount in future months or quarters, respectively. Each month or quarter, as applicable, we may lower or eliminate the discount without prior notice. We may also, without prior notice, change our determination as to whether common shares will be purchased by the plan administrator directly from us or in the open market.

Note 16Related Party Transactions
At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had receivables of approximately $2.5 million and $2.8 million, respectively, due from certain current and former executive officers. The loans include interest provisions (with a 4.9% average annual interest rate) and were made at various times from 1999 through 2002 and in 1998 to finance the income taxes payable by the executive officers resulting from: (i) our 1998 spin off of Kindred and (ii) vesting of restricted shares. The loans are payable over a period of ten years. Interest on a note relating to the spin off in the principal amount of $0.8 million at December 31, 2006 (the "Spin Off Note") is paid on a quarterly basis and principal on this note is paid annually. The payee of the Spin Off Note resigned as an employee and director of Ventas in January 2003. In the event of a change in control, as defined in our previous 1997 Incentive Compensation Plan, accrued interest on and the principal balance of the Spin Off Note is forgiven. Interest on the note relating to taxes paid for the vested portion of restricted shares (the "Restricted Share Note") is payable annually out of and only to the extent of dividends from the vested restricted shares. In the event of a change in control or upon termination of the officer without cause, as such terms are defined in the relevant employment agreement, the principal balance of the Restricted Share Note is forgiven. The Restricted Share Note is secured by a pledge of all of the restricted shares to which the Restricted Share Note relates and the Restricted Share Note is otherwise non-recourse. The Spin Off Note is not secured.
During 1998, we acquired eight personal care facilities and related facilities for approximately $7.1 million from Tangram Rehabilitation Network, Inc. ("Tangram"). Tangram is a wholly owned subsidiary of Res-Care, Inc. ("Res-Care") of which a member of our Board of Directors is the Chairman of the Board. We lease the Tangram facilities to Tangram pursuant to a master lease agreement which is guaranteed by Res-Care. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2005, Tangram has paid us approximately $897,000, $863,000 and $834,000, respectively, in base rent payments.

Note 18Subsequent Events
On January 14, 2007, we and our wholly owned subsidiaries, 2124678 Ontario Inc. (the "Securities Purchaser") and 2124680 Ontario Inc. (the "Asset Purchaser" and, together with the Securities Purchaser, the "Purchasers"), entered into a purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Sunrise REIT, Sunrise REIT Trust ("Sub Trust") and Sunrise REIT GP Inc. ("Sunrise GP"), in its capacity as general partner of Sunrise Canadian UPREIT, LP ("UPREIT"). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, we have agreed to cause the Purchasers to acquire all of Sunrise REIT's assets and to assume all of Sunrise REIT's liabilities (the "Transaction") for approximately $1.8 billion based on the exchange rates at the time we entered into the Purchase Agreement.
At the effective time of the Transaction, the Securities Purchaser will purchase all of the interests and assume all of the liabilities of Sunrise REIT Canadian Holdings Inc. ("Canco") and certain of Sunrise REIT's intercompany notes held by Sub Trust, and the Asset Purchaser will acquire all of Sunrise REIT's remaining assets and liabilities from Sunrise REIT, Sub Trust and UPREIT. If approved by Sunrise REIT's unitholders, each unit of beneficial interest of Sunrise REIT outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be redeemed at a redemption price of Cdn $15 in cash without any action on the part of the unitholders. The closing of the Transaction is scheduled to occur during the second quarter of 2007 and is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the approval of Sunrise REIT's unitholders.
As a result of the Transaction, we will acquire a 100% interest in 18 senior living communities and a 75-85% interest in 56 additional senior living communities, with the minority interest in those 56 communities being owned by affiliates of Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. ("Sunrise"). Of the 74 communities, 63 are located in metropolitan areas of 17 U.S. states and 11 are located in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and British Columbia. In addition, we expect to acquire for a fixed price five communities in the U.S. and Canada that are currently under development. Upon closing, we expect to own in aggregate 527 assets in 43 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces.
On January 14, 2007, we also entered into a letter agreement (the "Letter Agreement") with Sunrise. Sunrise and its affiliates manage Sunrise REIT's senior living communities pursuant to various management and other agreements and have other contractual relationships with Sunrise REIT. The Letter Agreement provides for the modification of certain terms under the existing agreements between Sunrise REIT and its affiliates, on the one hand, and Sunrise and its affiliates, on the other hand (the "Existing Agreements"), to be reflected in definitive agreements between the parties, which modifications will be effective upon closing of the Transaction. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the Strategic Alliance Agreement dated as of December 23, 2004 between Sunrise and Sunrise REIT will be terminated effective upon the closing and replaced with a new agreement that will provide, among other things, a right of first offer to us to acquire properties developed by Sunrise or its affiliates in Canada and in certain locations of the United States, generally on the terms set forth in the existing Strategic Alliance Agreement, but subject to modification of those terms to address changes in circumstances and other matters. The Letter Agreement also (1) provides us assurances that Sunrise will cooperate with us in connection with our compliance with the REIT rules under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and in connection with our financial reporting obligations, (2) contains restrictions on our rights to transfer our interest in the acquired properties to transferees who compete with Sunrise or who do not meet certain requirements, (3) provides that Sunrise consents to the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and waives certain rights under the Existing Agreements, and (4) confirms our right of first offer to acquire certain properties and various factual matters. The Letter Agreement is binding upon closing of the Transaction, but is expected to be replaced by more definitive agreements as described above.
On February 14, 2007, Health Care Property Investors, Inc. ("HCPI") submitted a proposal to acquire the assets of Sunrise REIT. HCPI has put forth an amended proposal and also proposed to enter into an agreement with Sunrise. In addition, in connection with our pending acquisition of Sunrise REIT and the competing offer from Health Care Property Investors, Inc., we are a party to proceedings in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice seeking legal interpretations of our rights under various agreements pertaining to the acquisition. Notices of application concerning the proceedings were filed on February 18, 2007 and February 21, 2007.
Note 19Condensed Consolidating Information
We and certain of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (the "Wholly Owned Subsidiary Guarantors") have fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, the obligation to pay principal and interest with respect to the Senior Notes of the Issuers. Ventas Capital Corporation is a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Ventas Realty that was formed to facilitate the offering of the senior notes and has no assets or operations. In addition, Ventas Realty and the Wholly Owned Subsidiary Guarantors have fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, the obligation to pay principal and interest with respect to our Convertible Notes. ETOP, of which we own substantially all of the partnership units, and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries (the "ETOP Subsidiary Guarantors" and collectively, with the Wholly Owned Subsidiary Guarantors, the "Guarantors"), have also provided a guarantee, on a joint and several basis, of the Senior Notes and the Convertible Notes. We have other subsidiaries ("Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries") that are not included among the
 
Table of Contents
Guarantors, and such subsidiaries are not obligated with respect to the Senior Notes or the Convertible Notes. Contractual and legal restrictions, including those contained in the instruments governing certain Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries' outstanding indebtedness, may under certain circumstances restrict our ability to obtain cash from our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries for the purpose of meeting our debt service obligations, including our guarantee of payment of principal and interest on the Senior Notes and our primary obligation to pay principal and interest on the Convertible Notes. Certain of our real estate assets are also subject to mortgages. The following summarizes our condensed consolidating information as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006:

Note 20ETOP Condensed Consolidating Information
ETOP, of which we own substantially all of the partnership interests, and the ETOP Subsidiary Guarantors have provided full and unconditional guarantees, on a joint and several basis with us and certain of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, of the obligation to pay principal and interest with respect to the Senior Notes and the Convertible Notes. See "Note 19Condensed Consolidating Information." Certain of ETOP's other direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (the "ETOP Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries") that have not provided the Guarantee of the Senior Notes or the Convertible Notes are therefore not directly obligated with respect to the Senior Notes or the Convertible Notes.
Contractual and legal restrictions, including those contained in the instruments governing certain of the ETOP Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries' outstanding indebtedness, may under certain circumstances restrict ETOP's (and therefore our) ability to obtain cash from the ETOP Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries for the purpose of satisfying ETOP's and our debt service obligations, including ETOP's and our guarantee of payment of principal and interest on the Senior Notes and our primary obligation to pay principal and interest on the Convertible Notes. See "Note 8Borrowing Arrangements." Certain of the ETOP Subsidiary Guarantors' properties are subject to mortgages.
For comparative purposes, the ETOP Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements for the periods prior to the ElderTrust merger are presented as "Predecessor Company" financial statements and are not included as part of our Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements for those periods.
