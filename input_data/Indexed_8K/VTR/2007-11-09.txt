For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, the Company's normalized FFO was $242.9 million, or $2.03 per diluted common share, as compared to $184.0 million, or $1.76 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. For the first nine months of 2007, the Company's net income available to common stockholders was $247.7 million, or $2.07 per diluted common share (after discontinued operations of $135.6 million), as compared to $90.6 million, or $0.87 per diluted common share (after discontinued operations of $4.4 million), for the comparable period in 2006.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") said today that third quarter 2007 normalized Funds from Operations ("FFO") rose 32 percent to $88.7 million, compared with $67.0 million in the third quarter of 2006.
LOUISVILLE, KY (November 8, 2007)
Normalized FFO per diluted common share in the third quarter of 2007 increased three percent to $0.66, from $0.64 per diluted common share for the comparable 2006 period. Weighted average diluted common shares outstanding in the third quarter of 2007 increased by 28.9 million shares to 133.5 million shares from 104.6 million shares for comparable period in 2006, and both periods reflect the $33.1 million increase in annual rent from the Company's tenant Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: KND) ("Kindred") that became effective in the third quarter of 2006. The year-over-year increase in normalized FFO per diluted common share is primarily attributable to the Company's acquisition program and its internal growth related to escalations on its triple-net lease portfolio.
FFO per diluted common share, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), in the third quarter of 2007 increased 24 percent to $0.73, from $0.59 per diluted common share for the comparable 2006 period.
Normalized Funds Available for Distribution ("FAD") per diluted common share in the third quarter of 2007 increased five percent to $0.62, from $0.59 per diluted common share for the comparable 2006 period. Year-over-year normalized FAD growth benefited from a decrease in straight-lining of rental income per diluted common share, offset by higher capital expenditures per diluted common share. The Company's total third quarter 2007 normalized FAD rose 32 percent to $82.1 million, compared with $62.1 million in the third quarter of 2006.
"Ventas had another excellent quarter, with all aspects of our business performing well and our liquidity position strong," Ventas Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Debra A. Cafaro said. "We continue to gain traction in our important medical office building ("MOB") strategic growth area, with year-to-date investments in that sector exceeding $150 million, bringing our MOB portfolio above one million square feet. The 78 Sunrise communities we acquired in the second quarter are fully integrated and delivering very positive results. And our core healthcare triple-net lease portfolio remains a strong, high performing foundation for our Company.

"Our strategy of building a high-quality, diverse and productive portfolio of healthcare and seniors housing assets is producing excellent results," Cafaro added. "Our sector has strong supply/demand fundamentals that are less correlated with economic business cycles. This should enable our portfolio to deliver superior long-term value."
Normalized FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 was $242.9 million, or $2.03 per diluted common share, a 32 percent increase from $184.0 million, or $1.76 per diluted common share, for the comparable 2006 period.
Normalized FFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007 excludes the net benefit (totaling $8.5 million and $34.4 million, respectively) of gains from merger-related currency transactions and income taxes, as well as a gain on the sale of securities, offset by merger-related costs.
SUNRISE PORTFOLIO
Total Portfolio
The Company's senior living portfolio acquired in the second quarter of 2007 from Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust ("Sunrise REIT") and managed by Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (NYSE: SRZ) ("Sunrise") contains 78 communities. Ventas owns 100 percent of 18 of these communities and has a partnership share of between 75 percent and 85 percent in the remaining 60 communities.
Ventas's partnership share of Net Operating Income after management fees ("NOI") was $29.1 million for those 78 communities for the three months ended September 30, 2007. Total community NOI was $34.0 million for the same period.
72 Stabilized Communities
For the 72 stabilized Sunrise communities, Ventas's share of NOI was $28.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2007. Total community NOI for the stabilized assets was $33.0 million for the same period.
Average occupancy for these 72 stabilized communities was 93.3 percent during the third quarter, which improved from occupancy of 92.3 percent reported for May and June 2007, the first two full months of Ventas's ownership of the assets. Average monthly sequential NOI at the stabilized Sunrise portfolio increased three percent over May and June results. Sunrise management continues to implement targeted programs to increase occupancy and control variable expenses at the Ventas communities. The quarterly occupancy rates and NOI across the communities were positively affected by these efforts.
Six Communities in Lease-up
Ventas's Sunrise portfolio also contains six newly developed communities that are in lease-up. These properties are expected to deliver stabilized unlevered yields of between 9 percent and 9.5 percent. Ventas's share of NOI at the development assets was $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2007. These assets collectively are expected to become accretive to earnings by early 2008.

Additional News
 
VENTAS EXPECTS 2007 NORMALIZED FFO AT HIGH END OF PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED RANGE
Ventas currently expects its 2007 normalized FFO to be at the high end of its previously announced guidance range of $2.60 to $2.67 per diluted common share. For 2006, Ventas reported normalized FFO per diluted common share of $2.44.
The Company's normalized FFO guidance for all periods assumes that all of the Company's tenants, borrowers and managers continue to meet all of their obligations to the Company. In addition, the Company's normalized FFO guidance (and related U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") earnings projections) excludes (a) gains and losses on the sales of assets, (b) the impact of future, unannounced acquisitions, divestitures (including pursuant to tenant options to purchase) and capital transactions, (c) merger-related benefits, costs and expenses that are not capitalized under GAAP, including transitional expenses, amortization of fees related to acquisition financing and costs, gains and losses for foreign currency hedge agreements, and expenses relating to the Company's lawsuit against HCP, Inc., (d) the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses or premiums incurred as a result of early debt retirement, (e) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits, and (f) dilution resulting from the Company's convertible notes.
The Company's guidance is based on a number of other assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.
A reconciliation of the Company's guidance to the Company's projected GAAP earnings is provided on a schedule attached to this press release. The Company may from time to time update its publicly announced guidance, but it is not obligated to do so.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO and FAD appropriate measures of performance of an equity REIT. The Company uses the NAREIT definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FAD represents normalized FFO excluding straight-line rental adjustments and capital expenditures.
FFO and FAD presented herein are not necessarily comparable to FFO and FAD presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Neither FFO nor FAD should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO or FAD necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs.
The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO and FAD should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
Normalized FFO Guidance for the Year Ending December 31, 2007

Net Debt to Pro Forma EBITDA
The following pro forma information considers the effect on net income, interest and depreciation of the Company's investments and other capital transactions that were completed during the three months ended September 30, 2007, as if the transactions had been consummated as of the beginning of the period. The following table illustrates net debt to pro forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") (dollars in thousands):
 
The Company considers EBITDA a profitability measure which indicates the Company's ability to service debt. The Company considers the net debt to pro forma EBITDA ratio a useful measure to evaluate the Company's ability to pay its indebtedness. EBITDA presented herein is not necessarily comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is EBITDA necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
