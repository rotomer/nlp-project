The Company expects its net income for 2008 to be between $1.36 and $1.43 per diluted share.

Lease 2 with Kindred, and the Company's earnings; (t) the impact on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of the Company's operators, tenants, borrowers and managers, as applicable, resulting from increased operating costs and uninsured liabilities for professional liability claims, and the ability of the Company's operators, tenants, borrowers and managers to accurately estimate the magnitude of such liabilities; and (u) the impact of the Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. strategic review process and accounting, legal and regulatory issues. Many of these factors are beyond the Company's control and the control of its management.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") said today that full year 2007 normalized Funds from Operations ("FFO") per diluted common share rose ten percent to $2.69, compared to $2.44 last year. Normalized FFO increased 30 percent in 2007 to $330.6 million, compared to $255.2 million in 2006.
LOUISVILLE, KY (February 13, 2008)
Normalized FFO for the fourth quarter of 2007 rose 23 percent to $87.7 million, versus $71.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2006. Normalized FFO per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of 2007 decreased one percent to $0.66, from $0.67 per diluted common share for the comparable 2006 period. FFO per diluted common share, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased nine percent to $0.75, from $0.69 per diluted common share for the comparable 2006 period. Both periods reflect the increase in annual rent from the Company's tenant Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: KND) ("Kindred") that became effective in the third quarter of 2006.
During the fourth quarter and year, the Company benefited from both internal growth and accretive acquisitions, offset by the Company's increase in outstanding shares and general and administrative costs, which are principally related to Ventas's acquisition of Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust ("Sunrise REIT") in 2007.
Weighted average diluted common shares outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased by 28.0 million shares to 133.7 million shares, from 105.7 million shares for the comparable period in 2006.
Normalized FFO for the three months and year ended December 31, 2007 excludes the net benefit (totaling $12.7 million and $47.1 million, respectively) of gains from merger-related currency transactions, income taxes and a gain on the sale of securities, offset by merger-related costs.

Funds Available for Distribution ("FAD") for the fourth quarter of 2007 rose 22 percent to $80.4 million, versus $65.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2006. FAD per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of 2007 decreased three percent to $0.60, from $0.62 per diluted common share for the comparable 2006 period. FAD increased 30 percent in 2007 to $306.9 million, compared to $234.8 million in 2006. FAD per diluted common share rose 11 percent in 2007 to $2.49, from $2.25 in 2006. Year-over-year FAD per diluted common share changed primarily due to the Company's increase in outstanding shares and additional capital expenditures as a result of the Sunrise REIT acquisition and the Company's growing medical office building ("MOB") portfolio, partially offset by higher cash rent on leases that provide for straight-lining of rental income.
"As the top performing healthcare REIT in 2007, Ventas had another excellent year, highlighted by the successful completion of our important Sunrise REIT acquisition. We delivered 12 percent total return to shareholders, built a premier diversified portfolio of seniors housing and healthcare assets and continued to strengthen our high performing team," Ventas Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Debra A. Cafaro said. "Our assets are performing well and our balance sheet and liquidity position are strong, which should provide us with excellent opportunities going forward.
"We started 2008 on an outstanding note, with an investment grade credit rating from Standard & Poor's. This "BBB-" rating  our second  demonstrates the benefits of our financial discipline and our high quality diversified portfolio," Cafaro added. "Our investment grade rating should enhance our access to capital and decrease our borrowing costs, both of which should benefit our shareholders."
BOARD INCREASES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND BY EIGHT PERCENT
Ventas also said that its Board of Directors voted to increase the Company's first quarter 2008 dividend to $0.5125 per share, an increase of eight percent from the 2007 quarterly dividend of $0.475 per share. The first quarter dividend is payable March 28, 2008 to stockholders of record on March 6, 2008.
"We are pleased to share our cash flow growth with our stockholders by increasing our dividend to an annualized rate of $2.05 per share," Cafaro stated.
SUNRISE PORTFOLIO
Total Portfolio
The Company's senior living operating portfolio contains 79 communities in North America that are managed by Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (NYSE: SRZ) ("Sunrise"). Ventas owns 100 percent of 18 of these communities and has a partnership share of between 75 percent and 85 percent in the remaining 61 communities, with Sunrise owning the minority interest in those 61 communities.
Ventas's partnership share of Net Operating Income after management fees ("NOI") was $28.9 million for those 79 communities for the three months ended December 31, 2007. Total community NOI was $33.7 million for the same period.
72 Stabilized Communities
For the 72 stabilized Sunrise communities, Ventas's share of NOI was $28.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2007. Total community NOI for the stabilized assets was $32.6 million for the same period. Revenues increased two percent versus third quarter results at the stabilized communities.
Average occupancy of 93 percent and strong revenue performance for these 72 stabilized communities during the fourth quarter demonstrate the quality and strength of the Sunrise portfolio and the market for seniors housing.

VENTAS ISSUES 2008 NORMALIZED FFO AND FAD GUIDANCE
Ventas currently expects its 2008 normalized FFO to be between $2.75 and $2.82 per diluted common share and FAD to be between $2.56 and $2.63 per diluted common share. Included within the Company's 2008 normalized FFO and FAD range is approximately $8 million to $10 million, or $0.06 to $0.07 per diluted share, of non-cash equity compensation.
The Company's normalized FFO and FAD guidance for all periods assumes that all of the Company's tenants, borrowers and managers continue to meet all of their obligations to the Company. In addition, the Company's normalized FFO and FAD guidance (and related U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") earnings projections) excludes (a) gains and losses on the sales of assets, (b) the impact of future, unannounced acquisitions, divestitures (including pursuant to tenant options to purchase) and capital transactions, (c) merger-related benefits, costs and expenses that are not capitalized under GAAP, including transitional expenses, amortization of fees related to acquisition financing and costs, gains and losses for foreign currency hedge agreements, and expenses relating to the Company's lawsuit against HCP, (d) the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses or premiums incurred as a result of early debt retirement, (e) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits, and (f) dilution, if any, resulting from the Company's convertible notes.
The Company's guidance is based on a number of other assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.
A reconciliation of the Company's guidance to the Company's projected GAAP earnings is provided on a schedule attached to this press release. The Company may from time to time update its publicly announced guidance, but it is not obligated to do so.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO and FAD appropriate measures of performance of an equity REIT. The Company uses the NAREIT definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FAD represents normalized FFO excluding straight-line rental adjustments and capital expenditures.
FFO and FAD presented herein are not necessarily comparable to FFO and FAD presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Neither FFO nor FAD should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO or FAD necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs.
The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO and FAD should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
Normalized FFO and FAD Guidance for the Year Ending December 31, 2008
The following table illustrates the Company's normalized FFO and FAD guidance per diluted common share for the year ending December 31, 2008:

Net Debt to Pro Forma EBITDA
The following pro forma information considers the effect on net income, interest and depreciation of the Company's investments and other capital transactions that were completed during the year ended December 31, 2007, as if the transactions had been consummated as of the beginning of the period. The following table illustrates net debt to pro forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") (dollars in thousands):
 
The Company considers EBITDA a profitability measure which indicates the Company's ability to service debt. The Company considers the net debt to pro forma EBITDA ratio a useful measure to evaluate the Company's ability to pay its indebtedness. EBITDA presented herein is not necessarily comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is EBITDA necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
