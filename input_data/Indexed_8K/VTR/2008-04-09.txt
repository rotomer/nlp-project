On April 8, 2008, HCP, Inc. ("HCP") filed a motion requesting permission from the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky to add a counterclaim against Ventas, Inc. (the "Company"). The motion filed by HCP alleges that the Company is the successor to Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust ("Sunrise REIT") and that Sunrise REIT failed to conduct a fair auction when it put itself up for sale in 2006. The motion follows the lawsuit filed by the Company in May 2007 against HCP asserting claims of tortious interference with contract and tortious interference with prospective business advantage. The Company intends to vigorously contest the motion and the substance of the allegations in the counterclaim filed by HCP.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
