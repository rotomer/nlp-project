Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") said today that first quarter 2008 normalized Funds from Operations ("FFO") increased 28 percent to $92.4 million from $72.1 million in the first quarter of 2007. Normalized FFO per diluted common share was $0.68 in the first quarter of both 2008 and 2007. Per share results were affected by an increase in the Company's weighted average diluted common shares outstanding to 136.7 million in the first quarter of 2008 from 106.8 million in the comparable 2007 period.
LOUISVILLE, KY (May 6, 2008)
FFO per diluted common share, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), in the first quarter of 2008 increased to $0.75 per diluted common share from $0.73 per diluted common share a year earlier.
First quarter results benefited from increased revenue from the Company's senior living operations and rental increases from the Company's triple-net lease portfolio. The Company did not own its 79 high-quality, private-pay seniors housing assets managed by Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (NYSE: SRZ) ("Sunrise") in the first quarter of 2007. Normalized FFO for the three months ended March 31, 2008 excludes the net benefit (totaling $9.8 million) from income taxes and gains on extinguishment of debt, offset by merger-related costs.
"We are pleased with our results and believe Ventas is poised to enjoy an outstanding 2008," Ventas Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Debra A. Cafaro said. "With an excellent balance sheet and full availability on our recently expanded $850 million revolving credit facilities, a robust pipeline of attractive opportunities and a high performing, diverse portfolio of triple-net leased and operating assets, we are in a position of strength and opportunity."

SUNRISE PORTFOLIO
Total Portfolio
The Company's operating portfolio contains 79 seniors housing communities in North America that are managed by Sunrise. Ventas owns 100 percent of 18 of these communities and has a partnership share of between 75 percent and 85 percent in the remaining 61 communities, with Sunrise owning the minority interest in those 61 communities.
Net Operating Income after management fees ("NOI") for the Sunrise portfolio was in line with the Company's expectations. Total community NOI for those 79 communities was $33.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2008. Ventas's partnership share of NOI was $28.7 million for the same period.
73 Stabilized Communities
For the 73 stabilized Sunrise communities, total community NOI was $32.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2008. Ventas's partnership share of NOI was $28.1 million for the same period. Strong average daily rate growth continued in the first quarter, rising two percent sequentially. Average occupancy of 92 percent for the stabilized communities was consistent with anticipated first quarter seasonality.
Six Communities in Lease-up
Ventas's Sunrise portfolio also contains six recently developed communities that are in lease-up. Ventas's share of NOI at the development assets was $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2008, compared to $0.9 million in fourth quarter of 2007. The decrease is due to a full quarter impact of early stage lease-up losses from the 229-unit independent living community located in Ontario and acquired by the Company in December 2007 ("Steeles"), and the reclassification of one asset from lease-up to stabilized.
Community NOI increased 57 percent for the five Sunrise development communities (excluding Steeles) in the first quarter of 2008 compared to fourth quarter 2007 results. These five assets also enjoyed a six percentage point sequential quarterly increase in occupancy, to 72 percent. The newly constructed and acquired Steeles community represents the sixth asset currently included in the lease-up portfolio. It continues to increase occupancy, which currently is 43 percent.
GAAP NET INCOME
Net income applicable to common shares for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 was $32.1 million, or $0.23 per diluted common share, after discontinued operations of $1.0 million, compared with net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 of $45.1 million, or $0.42 per diluted common share, after discontinued operations of $1.5 million.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO and FAD appropriate measures of performance of an equity REIT. The Company uses the NAREIT definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FAD represents normalized FFO excluding straight-line rental adjustments and routine capital expenditures.
FFO and FAD presented herein are not necessarily comparable to FFO and FAD presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Neither FFO nor FAD should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO or FAD necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs.
The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO and FAD should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
Normalized FFO and FAD Guidance for the Year Ending December 31, 2008
The following table illustrates the Company's normalized FFO and FAD per diluted common share guidance for the year ending December 31, 2008:

Net Debt to Pro Forma EBITDA
The following pro forma information considers the effect on net income, interest and depreciation of the Company's investments and other capital transactions that were completed during the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2008, as if the transactions had been consummated as of the beginning of the period. The following table illustrates net debt to pro forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") (dollars in thousands):
 
The Company considers EBITDA a profitability measure which indicates the Company's ability to service debt. The Company considers the net debt to pro forma EBITDA ratio a useful measure to evaluate the Company's ability to pay its indebtedness. EBITDA presented herein is not necessarily comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is EBITDA necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
