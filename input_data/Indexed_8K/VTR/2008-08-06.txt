Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") said today that second quarter 2008 normalized Funds from Operations ("FFO") increased 20 percent to $98.7 million from $82.1 million in the second quarter of 2007. Normalized FFO per diluted common share was $0.71 in the second quarter of 2008, compared to $0.70 in the second quarter of 2007.
CHICAGO, IL (August 5, 2008)
Second quarter results benefited from increased revenue due to a full quarter in 2008 of its 79 high-quality, private-pay seniors housing assets managed by Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (NYSE: SRZ) ("Sunrise") that were acquired primarily in late April 2007. The quarter also benefited from rental increases from the Company's triple-net lease portfolio, accretive investments and lower expenses at the Company's senior living operations. Higher weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 138.7 million in the second quarter of 2008, compared to 117.8 million in the second quarter of 2007 impacted per share amounts. Normalized FFO for the three months ended June 30, 2008 excludes the net benefit (totaling $2.7 million) from income taxes, offset by merger-related and other costs.
"Our balance sheet and liquidity position are strong and our diverse portfolio of triple-net leased and operating assets continues to deliver reliable cash flows and positive results," Ventas Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Debra A. Cafaro said. "We are operating from a position of strength that enables us to invest and grow despite a challenging capital markets and economic environment."
FFO per diluted common share, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), in the second quarter of 2008 decreased to $0.73 from $0.87 a year earlier, due to an $18.6 million gain from a foreign currency hedge in the second quarter of 2007 and higher weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the second quarter of 2008.

Normalized FFO for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was $191.0 million, or $1.39 per diluted common share, a 24 percent increase from $154.2 million, or $1.37 per diluted common share, for the comparable 2007 period. Normalized FFO for the six months ended June 30, 2008 excludes the net benefit (totaling $12.6 million) from income taxes, offset by merger-related and other costs.
SUNRISE PORTFOLIO
Total Portfolio
The Company's operating portfolio contains 79 seniors housing communities in North America that are managed by Sunrise. Ventas owns 100 percent of 18 of these communities and has a partnership share of between 75 percent and 85 percent in the remaining 61 communities, with Sunrise owning the minority interest in those 61 communities.
Net Operating Income after management fees ("NOI") for those 79 communities was $38.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2008. Ventas's partnership share of NOI was $33.1 million for the same period.
74 Stabilized Communities
For the 74 stabilized Sunrise communities, total community NOI was $36.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2008. Ventas's partnership share of NOI was $32.1 million for the same period. Average daily rate in these communities increased 5.5 percent versus the Company's two-month ownership period in the second quarter of 2007 and declined slightly versus first quarter of 2008. The stabilized communities averaged 91 percent occupancy during the second quarter of 2008, compared to 92 percent in the first quarter of 2008 and the Company's two-month ownership period in the second quarter of 2007. During the second quarter of 2008, one asset was reclassified from lease-up to stabilized.
Five Communities in Lease-up
Ventas's Sunrise portfolio also contains five recently developed communities that are in lease-up. Total community NOI for the five lease-up communities was $1.2 million during the second quarter of 2008 versus $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2008. The increase is due to a five percentage point sequential quarterly increase in occupancy (75 percent compared to 70 percent) for the four "mansion" assisted living communities included in the lease-up portfolio. Average occupancy for the 229-unit independent living community located in Ontario and acquired by the Company in December 2007 ("Steeles") increased from 34 percent in the first quarter of 2008 to 46 percent in the second quarter of 2008.
Ventas's partnership share of NOI for the five lease-up assets was $1.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2008, compared to $0.4 million in first quarter of 2008.
GAAP NET INCOME
Net income applicable to common shares for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 was $71.1 million, or $0.51 per diluted common share, after discontinued operations of $27.7 million, compared with net income applicable to common shares for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 of $174.6 million, or $1.48 per diluted common share, after discontinued operations of $135.2 million.
Net income applicable to common shares for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was $103.1 million, or $0.75 per diluted common share, after discontinued operations of $28.6 million, compared with net income applicable to common shares for the six months ended June 30, 2007 of $219.7 million, or $1.96 per diluted common share, after discontinued operations of $136.7 million.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO and FAD appropriate measures of performance of an equity REIT. The Company uses the NAREIT definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FAD represents normalized FFO excluding straight-line rental adjustments and routine capital expenditures.
FFO and FAD presented herein are not necessarily comparable to FFO and FAD presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Neither FFO nor FAD should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO or FAD necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO and FAD should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
Normalized FFO and FAD Guidance for the Year Ending December 31, 2008
The following table illustrates the Company's normalized FFO and FAD per diluted common share guidance for the year ending December 31, 2008:

Net Debt to Pro Forma EBITDA
The following pro forma information considers the effect on net income, interest and depreciation of the Company's investments and other capital transactions that were completed during the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2008, as if the transactions had been consummated as of the beginning of the period. The following table illustrates net debt to pro forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") (dollars in thousands):
 
The Company considers EBITDA a profitability measure which indicates the Company's ability to service debt. The Company considers the net debt to pro forma EBITDA ratio a useful measure to evaluate the Company's ability to pay its indebtedness. EBITDA presented herein is not necessarily comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is EBITDA necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
