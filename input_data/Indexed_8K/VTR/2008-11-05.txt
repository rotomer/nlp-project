A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated in this Item 2.02 by reference.
The press release states that the Company's normalized funds from operations ("FFO") for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 were $97.2 million, or $0.69 per diluted common share, as compared to $88.7 million, or $0.66 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2007. FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), for the third quarter of 2008 was $113.9 million, or $0.81 per diluted common share, as compared to $97.1 million, or $0.73 per diluted common share, for the comparable 2007 period. The Company's net income applicable to common shares for the third quarter of 2008 was $64.7 million, or $0.46 per diluted common share (including income from discontinued operations of $0.6 million), versus $28.0 million, or $0.21 per diluted common share (including income from discontinued operations of $0.8 million), for the comparable period in 2007.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, the Company's normalized FFO was $288.2 million, or $2.08 per diluted common share, as compared to $242.9 million, or $2.03 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, for the first nine months of 2008 was $317.5 million, or $2.29 per diluted common share, as compared to $277.3 million, or $2.32 per diluted common share, for the comparable 2007 period. The Company's net income applicable to common shares for the first nine months of 2008 was $167.8 million, or $1.21 per diluted common share (including income from discontinued operations of $29.7 million), versus $247.7 million, or $2.07 per diluted common share (including income from discontinued operations of $138.0 million), for the comparable period in 2007.
The press release also states that the Company expects its normalized FFO for the year ending December 31, 2008 to be between $2.71 and $2.74 per diluted common share, updated from its previous guidance. The Company expects its net income applicable to common shares for 2008 to be between $1.68 and $1.71 per diluted common share.

(together with its subsidiaries, "Sunrise"), including the timely delivery of accurate property-level financial results for the Company's properties; (p) factors causing volatility in the Company's revenues generated by its seniors housing communities managed by Sunrise, including without limitation national and regional economic conditions, costs of materials, energy, labor and services, employee benefit costs and professional and general liability claims; (q) the movement of U.S. and Canadian exchange rates; (r) year-over-year changes in the Consumer Price Index and the effect of those changes on the rent escalators, including the rent escalator for Master Lease 2 with Kindred, and the Company's earnings; (s) the impact on the
liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of the Company's operators, tenants, borrowers and managers, as applicable, resulting from increased operating costs and uninsured liabilities for professional liability claims, and the ability of the Company's operators, tenants, borrowers and managers to accurately estimate the magnitude of these liabilities; (t) the ability and willingness of the lenders under the Company's unsecured revolving credit facilities to fund, in whole or in part, borrowing requests made by the Company from time to time; (u) the impact of market or issuer events on the liquidity or value of the Company's investments in marketable securities; and (v) the impact of the Sunrise strategic review process and accounting, legal and regulatory issues. Many of these factors are beyond the Company's control and the control of its management.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") said today that third quarter 2008 normalized Funds from Operations ("FFO") increased 9.6 percent to $97.2 million, from $88.7 million in the third quarter of 2007. Normalized FFO per diluted common share increased 4.5 percent, to $0.69 in the third quarter of 2008, compared to $0.66 in the third quarter of 2007.
CHICAGO, IL (November 4, 2008)
Third quarter normalized FFO benefited from rental increases from the Company's triple-net lease portfolio, higher revenues at the Company's senior living and medical office building ("MOB") operating portfolio, accretive investments and lower interest expense, offset in part by increased general and administrative expenses and higher expenses at the Company's operating portfolio. Higher weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 141.1 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared to 133.5 million in the third quarter of 2007, impacted per share amounts. Normalized FFO for the three months ended September 30, 2008 excludes the net benefit (totaling $16.7 million) principally from the reversal of a $23.3 million previously recorded contingent liability, partially offset by a $6.0 million valuation allowance on real estate mortgage loans receivable and merger-related and other costs.
"We are pleased with 4.5 percent growth in normalized FFO per diluted share this quarter, which demonstrates the strength of our portfolio. Importantly, our balance sheet and liquidity are strong and our diverse portfolio of triple-net leases and operating assets continues to deliver reliable cash flows and positive results," Ventas Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Debra A. Cafaro said. "We are operating from a position of safety that is paramount in today's challenging capital and economic environment."
Normalized FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 increased 18.7 percent to $288.2 million, or $2.08 per diluted common share, from $242.9 million, or $2.03 per diluted common share, for the comparable 2007 period. Normalized FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 excludes the net benefit (totaling $29.3 million) from income taxes and the previously recorded contingent liability reversal, offset by the valuation allowance on real estate mortgage loans receivable and merger-related and other costs.

FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), in the third quarter of 2008 increased 17.3 percent, to $113.9 million from $97.1 million from the prior year. NAREIT FFO per diluted common share rose 11.0 percent to $0.81, from $0.73 per diluted common share a year earlier. This increase in FFO is principally due to the benefit of the previously recorded contingent liability reversal, offset in part by the valuation allowance on real estate mortgage loans receivable and lower income tax benefit compared to the third quarter of 2007. Higher weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the third quarter of 2008 over the prior year impacted per share amounts.
NAREIT FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 increased 14.5 percent to $317.5 million, or $2.29 per diluted common share, from $277.3 million, or $2.32 per diluted common share, for the comparable 2007 period. The decrease in NAREIT FFO per diluted common share is principally due to a $24.3 million gain from foreign currency hedges in 2007 and higher weighted average diluted shares outstanding in 2008.
UPDATED NORMALIZED FFO GUIDANCE FOR 2008
Ventas currently expects its 2008 normalized FFO per diluted share to be between $2.71 and $2.74, as compared to previous 2008 guidance of $2.75 to $2.82 per diluted share. This change is primarily the result of the Company's proactive steps to increase its liquidity; economic factors; dead deal costs; the impact of foreign currency changes; and higher weighted average shares outstanding.
"We are committed to preserving the Company's financial strength and increasing long-term value for shareholders," Cafaro said. "We believe that, to be successful in today's environment, companies must have low leverage, limited near term maturities and continued access to capital. As a result of our efforts during the last few years, Ventas has all three. While our actions may affect near term earnings at the margin, they are the right thing to do to ensure that Ventas remains strong through this extremely challenging time in the markets and our economy."
The Company's normalized FFO guidance for all periods assumes that all of the Company's tenants and borrowers continue to meet all of their obligations to the Company. In addition, the Company's normalized FFO guidance (and related U.S. generally accepted accounting principals ("GAAP") earnings projections) excludes (a) gains and losses on the sales of assets, (b) the impact of future, unannounced acquisitions, divestitures (including pursuant to tenant options to purchase) and capital transactions, (c) merger-related costs and expenses that are not capitalized under GAAP, including transitional and severance expenses, amortization of fees related to acquisition financing and costs, gains and losses for foreign currency hedge agreements, (d) the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of the Company's debt, (e) dilution resulting from the Company's convertible notes, (f) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits, and (g) the reversal or incurrence of contingent liabilities.
The Company's guidance is based on a number of other assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.
A reconciliation of the Company's guidance to the Company's projected GAAP earnings is provided on a schedule attached to this press release. The Company may from time to time update its publicly announced guidance, but it is not obligated to do so.

SUNRISE PORTFOLIO
Total Portfolio
The Company's operating portfolio contains 79 seniors housing communities in North America that are managed by Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (NYSE: SRZ) ("Sunrise"). Ventas owns 100 percent of 18 of these communities and has a partnership share of between 75 percent and 85 percent in the remaining 61 communities, with Sunrise owning the minority interest in those 61 communities.
Net Operating Income after management fees ("NOI") for those 79 communities was $35.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2008, compared to $34.0 million for 78 communities during the three months ended September 30, 2007. For the 78 communities Ventas owned in the third quarter of 2008 and 2007, NOI increased four percent, average daily rate increased three percent and occupancy was stable at 91 percent.
72 Same Store Stabilized Community Results
For the 72 Sunrise communities that were stabilized in both the third quarter of 2008 and the third quarter of 2007, total community NOI was $33.3 million in 2008 versus $33.0 million for the comparable 2007 period. Average daily rate in these same store stabilized communities increased three percent versus the third quarter of 2007. These same store stabilized communities averaged 92 percent occupancy during the third quarter of 2008, compared to 91 percent in the second quarter of 2008 and 93 percent in the third quarter of 2007.
Three Communities in Lease-up
Ventas's Sunrise portfolio also contains three recently developed communities that are in lease-up. Total community NOI for the three lease-up communities was $0.3 million during the third quarter of 2008, which was unchanged from the second quarter of 2008.
Average occupancy in this three community pool increased from 54 percent to 59 percent. The occupancy increase is partially due to a four percentage point sequential quarterly increase in occupancy, to 70 percent, for the two "mansion" assisted living communities included in the lease-up portfolio. Average occupancy for the 229-unit independent living community located in Ontario and acquired by the Company in December 2007 ("Steeles") increased to 52 percent in the third quarter of 2008 from 46 percent in the second quarter of 2008.
During the third quarter of 2008, two communities were reclassified from lease-up to stabilized.
GAAP NET INCOME
Net income applicable to common shares for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 was $64.7 million, or $0.46 per diluted common share, after discontinued operations of $0.6 million, compared with net income applicable to common shares for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 of $28.0 million, or $0.21 per diluted common share, after discontinued operations of $0.8 million.
Net income applicable to common shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was $167.8 million, or $1.21 per diluted common share, after discontinued operations of $29.7 million, compared with net income applicable to common shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 of $247.7 million, or $2.07 per diluted common share, after discontinued operations of $138.0 million.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO and FAD appropriate measures of performance of an equity REIT. The Company uses the NAREIT definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FAD represents normalized FFO excluding straight-line rental adjustments and routine capital expenditures.
FFO and FAD presented herein are not necessarily comparable to FFO and FAD presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Neither FFO nor FAD should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO or FAD necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO and FAD should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
The Company's normalized FFO excludes (a) gains and losses on the sales of assets, (b) merger-related benefits, costs and expenses that are not capitalized under GAAP, including transitional expenses, amortization of fees related to acquisition financing and costs, gains and losses for foreign currency hedge agreements, and expenses relating to the Company's lawsuit against HCP, Inc., (c) the impact of any expenses related to real estate asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses or premiums incurred as a result of early debt retirement, (d) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits, (e) dilution, if any, resulting from the Company's convertible notes, and (f) the reversal of contingent liabilities.

Net Debt to Pro Forma EBITDA
The following pro forma information considers the effect on net income, interest and depreciation of the Company's investments and other capital transactions that were completed during the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2008, as if the transactions had been consummated as of the beginning of the period. The following table illustrates net debt to pro forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") (dollars in thousands):
 
The Company considers EBITDA a profitability measure which indicates the Company's ability to service debt. The Company considers the net debt to pro forma EBITDA ratio a useful measure to evaluate the Company's ability to pay its indebtedness. EBITDA presented herein is not necessarily comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is EBITDA necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
