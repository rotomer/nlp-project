For the year ended December 31, 2008, NAREIT FFO was $416.0 million, or $2.97 per diluted common share, as compared to $377.7 million, or $3.07 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2007.

(together with its subsidiaries, "Sunrise"), including the timely delivery of accurate property-level financial results for the Company's properties; (p) factors causing volatility in the Company's revenues generated by its seniors housing communities managed by Sunrise, including without limitation national and regional economic conditions, costs of materials, energy, labor and services, employee benefit costs and professional and general liability claims; (q) the movement of U.S. and Canadian exchange rates; (r) year-over-year changes in the Consumer Price Index and the effect of those changes on the rent escalators, including the rent escalator for Master Lease 2 with Kindred, and the Company's earnings; (s) the impact on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of the Company's operators, tenants, borrowers and managers, as applicable, resulting from increased
operating costs and uninsured liabilities for professional liability claims, and the ability of the Company's operators, tenants, borrowers and managers to accurately estimate the magnitude of such liabilities; (t) the ability and willingness of the lenders under the Company's unsecured revolving credit facilities to fund, in whole or in part, borrowing requests made by the Company from time to time; (u) the impact of market or issuer events on the liquidity or value of the Company's investments in marketable securities; and (v) the impact of any financial, accounting, legal or regulatory issues that may affect Sunrise. Many of these factors are beyond the Company's control and the control of its management.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") said today that normalized Funds From Operations ("FFO") per fully diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2008 rose two percent to $2.74, from $2.69 for the comparable 2007 period. Normalized FFO for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 16 percent to $383.2 million, from $330.6 million for the comparable 2007 period. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding in 2008 totaled 139.9 million, compared to 123.0 million in 2007. Normalized FFO for the year ended December 31, 2008 excludes the net benefit (totaling $32.9 million or $0.24 per share) from income taxes, reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability and net gains on extinguishment of debt, offset by the valuation allowance on real estate mortgage loans receivable and merger-related costs.
CHICAGO, IL (February 12, 2009)
"In 2008, we took defensive, proactive steps to build liquidity and financial strength, while still delivering positive FFO per share growth," Ventas Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Debra A. Cafaro said. "Our focus on protecting shareholder value is clear and unequivocal as we move into 2009. Low leverage, staggered debt maturities, a stable, cash flowing portfolio and negligible forward commitments provide a sound foundation to accomplish this goal and position us for growth when conditions change."
Fourth quarter 2008 normalized FFO increased eight percent to $95.0 million, from $87.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Normalized FFO per diluted common share was stable at $0.66 for both periods.
Fourth quarter normalized FFO per share benefited from rental increases from the Company's triple-net lease portfolio, higher revenues at the Company's medical office building ("MOB") operating portfolio, additional investments and lower interest expense, offset in part by lower Net Operating Income after management fees ("NOI") at the Company's senior living operating portfolio, the movement in foreign exchange rates and higher weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The Company had 143.0 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to 133.7 million shares in the fourth quarter of 2007. Normalized FFO for the three months ended December 31, 2008 excludes the net benefit (totaling $3.6 million) from net gains on extinguishment of debt and income taxes, offset by merger-related costs.
FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), in the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased two percent to $98.5 million, from $100.4 million in the prior year. NAREIT FFO per diluted common share decreased eight percent to $0.69, from $0.75 a year earlier. This decrease in NAREIT FFO is principally due to higher weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2008 over the prior year.

NAREIT FFO for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased ten percent to $416.0 million, or $2.97 per diluted common share, from $377.7 million, or $3.07 per diluted common share, for the comparable 2007 period. The decrease in NAREIT FFO per diluted common share is principally due to higher weighted average diluted shares outstanding in 2008.
BOARD DECLARES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.5125 PER COMMON SHARE
Ventas also said that its Board of Directors declared the Company's first quarter 2009 dividend of $0.5125 per share. The first quarter dividend is payable in cash on March 31, 2009 to stockholders of record on March 18, 2009.
"We are pleased to continue sharing our strong cash flow with our shareholders," Cafaro stated. "This decision indicates our confidence in our portfolio, cash flows and balance sheet."
SUNRISE PORTFOLIO
Total Portfolio
The Company's operating portfolio contains 79 seniors housing communities in North America that are managed by Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (NYSE: SRZ) ("Sunrise"). Ventas owns 100 percent of 18 of these communities and has a partnership share of between 75 percent and 85 percent in the remaining 61 communities, and Sunrise owns a minority interest in those 61 communities.
NOI for those 79 communities was $138.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The portfolio was acquired in 2007 and a comparison to the prior full year period is not available.
NOI was $32.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2008, compared to $33.7 million during the three months ended December 31, 2007. The fourth quarter decrease is principally related to the movement in the Canadian dollar exchange rate, which had an unfavorable impact on NOI of $1.2 million, and lower occupancy in the stabilized portfolio versus the comparable 2007 period.
72 Same Store Stabilized Community ResultsAverage Occupancy of 91 Percent
For the 72 Sunrise communities that were stabilized in both the fourth quarter of 2008 and the fourth quarter of 2007, total community NOI was $29.4 million in 2008 versus $32.6 million for the comparable 2007 period. The movement in the Canadian dollar exchange rate had an unfavorable impact on NOI of $1.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, average daily rate declined by two percent, and occupancy declined by 210 basis points, in the fourth quarter of 2008 versus the same period in 2007.
Average occupancy for the 72 same store stabilized communities was a strong 91.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Two Communities in Lease-up
Ventas's Sunrise portfolio also contains two recently developed communities that are in lease-up. Total community NOI for the two lease-up communities increased significantly, to $0.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2008, from $0.1 million during the third quarter of 2008.
Average occupancy for these two communities during the fourth quarter of 2008 increased 500 basis points to 63.7 percent, compared to 58.2 percent during the third quarter of 2008.

VENTAS ISSUES 2009 NORMALIZED FFO AND FAD GUIDANCE
Ventas currently expects its 2009 normalized FFO to be between $2.55 and $2.65 per diluted common share and FAD to be between $2.39 and $2.49 per diluted common share. The Company's normalized FFO guidance for all periods assumes that all of the Company's tenants and borrowers continue to meet all of their obligations to the Company. In addition, the Company's normalized FFO guidance (and related GAAP earnings projections) excludes (a) gains and losses on the sales of assets, (b) the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures (including pursuant to tenant options to purchase) and capital transactions, (c) merger-related costs and expenses that are not

capitalized under GAAP, including expenses relating to the Company's lawsuit against HCP, Inc., (d) the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of the Company's debt, (e) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses, (f) acquisition costs and expenses and earn out payments required by GAAP to be expensed rather than capitalized into asset cost, and (g) the reversal or incurrence of contingent liabilities.
The Company's guidance is based on a number of other assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.
A reconciliation of the Company's guidance to the Company's projected GAAP earnings is provided on a schedule attached to this press release. The Company may from time to time update its publicly announced guidance, but it is not obligated to do so.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO and FAD appropriate measures of performance of an equity REIT. The Company uses the NAREIT definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FAD represents normalized FFO excluding straight-line rental adjustments and routine capital expenditures.

FFO and FAD presented herein are not necessarily comparable to FFO and FAD presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Neither FFO nor FAD should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO or FAD necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO and FAD should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
The Company's normalized FFO excludes (a) gains and losses on the sales of assets, (b) merger-related costs and expenses that are not capitalized under GAAP, including expenses relating to the Company's lawsuit against HCP, Inc., (c) the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts or premiums incurred as a result of early debt retirement, (d) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits, (e) dilution, if any, resulting from the Company's convertible notes, and (f) the reversal of contingent liabilities.

Net Debt to Pro Forma EBITDA
The following pro forma information considers the effect on net income, interest and depreciation of the Company's investments and other capital transactions that were completed during the year ended December 31, 2008, as if the transactions had been consummated as of the beginning of the period. The following table illustrates net debt to pro forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") (dollars in thousands):
 
The Company considers EBITDA a profitability measure which indicates the Company's ability to service debt. The Company considers the net debt to pro forma EBITDA ratio a useful measure to evaluate the Company's ability to pay its indebtedness. EBITDA presented herein is not necessarily comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is EBITDA necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
