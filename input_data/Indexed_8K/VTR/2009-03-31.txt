On March 25, 2009, the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky granted Ventas, Inc. (the "Company") judgment on the pleadings against all counterclaims brought by HCP, Inc. ("HCP") against the Company. The Court dismissed HCP's counterclaims with prejudice on the basis that HCP's pleadings were inadequate to state a claim on which relief can be granted. The counterclaims followed the lawsuit filed by the Company in May 2007 against HCP asserting claims of tortious interference with contract and tortious interference with prospective business advantage.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
