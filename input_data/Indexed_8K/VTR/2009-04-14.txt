On April 13, 2009, Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership and Ventas Capital Corporation (collectively, the "Issuers"), both wholly owned subsidiaries of Ventas, Inc. (the "Company"), issued and sold $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of their 6

% Senior Notes due 2016 (the "Notes") in a registered public offering pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-158424) filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which Registration Statement became automatically effective on April 6, 2009. The Notes were sold pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated April 7, 2009 among the Issuers, the Company, Ventas LP Realty, L.L.C. and the underwriters named therein. The Notes are substantially similar in all respects to the Issuers' existing $200 million aggregate principal amount of 6

/
2
% Senior Notes due 2016, except that the Notes were issued with original issue discount and, thus, are a separate series from, and have a different CUSIP number than, the existing notes.
The Notes mature on June 1, 2016. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.50% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing June 1, 2009. The Notes are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by the Company and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries until certain conditions are met.
The Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Issuers, the Company and the other guarantors, ranking equal in right of payment with all of such entities' existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and ranking senior in right of payment to all of such entities' existing and future subordinated indebtedness. However, the Notes will be effectively subordinated to all secured borrowings to the extent of the assets securing those obligations. The Notes will also be structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other obligations of the Company's subsidiaries that are not guarantors with respect to the assets of those entities.
The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes, together with the net proceeds from the sale of its common stock, to fund the Company's cash tender offers with respect to the outstanding 6

% Senior Notes due 2015 issued by the Issuers. The Company expects to use the excess net proceeds to repay indebtedness outstanding under its unsecured revolving credit facilities and for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including to fund future acquisitions or investments, if any.
The terms of the Notes, summarized below, are governed by the Indenture dated as of September 19, 2006 (the "Base Indenture"), as amended by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 13, 2009 (the "Second Supplemental Indenture"), among the Issuers, the
Company and the other guarantors named therein, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Base Indenture, as so amended (the "Indenture"), contains certain covenants that limit the Issuers' ability and the ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined therein) to, among other things: incur debt; incur secured debt; make certain dividend payments, distributions and investments; enter into certain transactions, including transactions with affiliates; restrict dividends or other payments from subsidiaries; merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of their respective assets; and sell assets. Upon the occurrence of certain types of changes of control, the Indenture requires the Issuers to make an offer to purchase the Notes at 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date, unless certain conditions are met.
The Issuers may redeem the Notes, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, (i) prior to June 1, 2011, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a make-whole premium, (ii) during the twelve-month periods beginning on June 1 of the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, at redemption prices equal to 103.250%, 102.167% and 101.083%, respectively, of the principal amount thereof, and (iii) on and after June 1, 2014, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, in each case, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. In addition, the Issuers may redeem up to 35% of the original principal amount of the Notes before June 1, 2009 with net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 106.500% of the principal amount of the Notes to be so redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.
The Indenture contains certain customary events of default, including without limitation failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, cross-defaults to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases will automatically cause the acceleration of, the amounts due under the Notes.
U.S. Bank National Association, the trustee under the Indenture, is also the trustee under the indenture relating to the Issuers' existing 6

Section 4.11. .
Incurrence of Debt
(a) Ventas, Inc. shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, incur any additional Debt (other than Permitted Debt) if, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence of such additional Debt and the application of the proceeds thereof, the aggregate principal amount of all of Ventas, Inc.'s and its Restricted Subsidiaries' outstanding Debt on a consolidated basis determined in accordance with GAAP would be greater than 60% of the sum of (without duplication):
(1) the Total Assets of Ventas, Inc. and its Restricted Subsidiaries as of the end of the calendar quarter covered by Ventas, Inc.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as the case may be, most recently filed with the Commission (or, if such filing is not permitted under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the calendar quarter covered by Ventas, Inc.'s most recent report filed with the Trustee) prior to the incurrence of such additional Debt (the "Measurement Date"); and
 
(2) the purchase price of any Real Estate Assets or mortgages receivable acquired, and the amount of any securities offering proceeds received (to the extent that such proceeds were not used to acquire Real Estate Assets or mortgages receivable or used to reduce Debt), by Ventas, Inc. or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis since the Measurement Date (such sum of clauses (1) and (2) being collectively referred to as "Adjusted Total Assets").
(b) In addition to the limitations in Section 4.11(a), Ventas, Inc. shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, incur any Secured Debt (other than Permitted Debt) if, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence of such additional Secured Debt and the application of the proceeds thereof, the aggregate principal amount of all of Ventas, Inc.'s and its Restricted Subsidiaries' outstanding Secured Debt on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP is greater than 40% of Adjusted Total Assets.
(c) In addition to the limitations in Sections 4.11(a) and (b), Ventas, Inc. shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, incur any Debt (other than Permitted Debt) if the ratio of Consolidated Income Available for Debt Service to Annual Debt Service for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended on the Measurement Date shall have been less than 2.0x, on a pro forma basis after giving effect thereto and to the application of the proceeds therefrom, and calculated on the assumption that:
(1) such Debt and any other Debt incurred by Ventas, Inc. and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis since the first day of such four-quarter period and the application of the proceeds therefrom, including to refinance other Debt, had been incurred at the beginning of such period;
(2) the repayment or retirement of any other Debt by Ventas, Inc. and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis since the first day of such four-quarter period had been repaid or retired at the beginning of such period (except that, in making such computation, the amount of Debt under any revolving credit facility shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Debt during such period);
(3) in the case of Acquired Debt or Debt incurred in connection with any acquisition since the first day of such four-quarter period, the related acquisition had occurred as of the first day of such period with appropriate pro forma adjustments
 
to, among other things, Consolidated Income Available for Debt Service, with respect to such acquisition being included in such pro forma calculation; and
(4) in the case of any acquisition or disposition by Ventas, Inc. or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis of any asset or group of assets since the first day of such four-quarter period, whether by merger, stock purchase or sale, or asset purchase or sale, such acquisition or disposition or any related repayment of Debt had occurred as of the first day of such period with the appropriate pro forma adjustments with respect to such acquisition or disposition being included in such pro forma calculation.
If the Debt giving rise to the need to make the foregoing calculation or any other Debt incurred after the first day of the relevant four-quarter period bears interest at a floating rate then, for purposes of calculating Annual Debt Service, the interest rate on such Debt will be computed on a pro forma basis as if the average interest rate in effect during the entire such four-quarter period had been the applicable rate for the entire such period; , , that for purposes of calculating Annual Debt Service for Debt for which there is a corresponding Hedging Obligation, Annual Debt Service shall be calculated after giving effect to the Hedging Obligation.

(c) Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales or Qualified CMBS Transactions that are not applied or invested as provided in Section 4.13(b) will constitute "Excess Proceeds."

is with the Notes containing provisions similar to those set forth in this Section 4.13 (including, without limitation, the holders of notes outstanding under the Issuers' existing indentures) with respect to offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets or in connection with securitizations to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and such other Debt that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer or Qualified CMBS Transaction Offer will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of any Notes purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of purchase, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer or a Qualified CMBS Transaction Offer, the Issuers may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other Debt tendered pursuant to such Asset Sale Offer or Qualified CMBS Transaction Offer, as applicable, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee will select the Notes and such other Debt to be purchased on a pro rata basis. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer and Qualified CMBS Transaction Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.

(c) Notwithstanding Section 4.20(b) hereof, neither (1) the continued existence following the reinstatement of the foregoing covenants of facts and circumstances or obligations that were incurred or otherwise came into existence while the foregoing covenants were suspended nor (2) the performance of any such obligations, including the consummation of any transaction pursuant to, and on materially the same terms as, a contractual agreement in existence prior to the reinstatement of the foregoing covenants, shall constitute a breach of any such covenants or cause a Default or Event of Default thereunder; , , that (A) Ventas, Inc. and its Restricted Subsidiaries did not incur or otherwise cause such facts and circumstances or obligations to exist in anticipation of the reinstatement of the foregoing covenants and (B) Ventas, Inc. and its Restricted Subsidiaries did not reasonably believe that such incurrence or actions would result in such reinstatement. For purposes of clause (2) above, any increase in the consideration to be paid prior to such amendment or modification to the terms of an existing obligation following the reinstatement of the foregoing covenants that does not exceed 10% of the consideration that was to be paid prior to such amendment or modification shall not be deemed a "material" amendment or modification. For purposes of clauses (A) and (B) above, anticipation and reasonable belief may be determined by Ventas, Inc. and shall be conclusively evidenced by a board resolution to such effect adopted by the Board of Directors of Ventas, Inc. The Board of Directors of Ventas, Inc. in making its determination may, but need not, consult with Moody's or S&P, as applicable.

(f) Notwithstanding Section 4.20(e) hereof, neither (1) the continued existence following the reinstatement of Section 4.11 of facts and circumstances or obligations that were incurred or otherwise came into existence while Section 4.11 was suspended nor (2) the performance of any such obligations, including the consummation of any transaction pursuant to, and on materially the same terms as, a contractual agreement in existence prior to the reinstatement of Section 4.11, shall constitute a breach of Section 4.11 or cause a Default or Event of Default thereunder; , , that (A) Ventas, Inc. and its Restricted Subsidiaries did not incur or otherwise cause such facts and circumstances or obligations to exist in anticipation of the reinstatement of Section 4.11 and (B) Ventas, Inc. and its Restricted Subsidiaries did not reasonably believe that such incurrence or actions would result in such reinstatement. For purposes of clause (2) above, any increase in the consideration to be paid prior to such amendment or modification to the terms of an existing obligation following the reinstatement of Section 4.11 that does not exceed 10% of the consideration that was to be paid prior to such amendment or modification shall not be deemed a "material" amendment or modification.

Capitalized Terms
2. . The Guaranteeing Subsidiary hereby agrees as follows:
Agreement to Guarantee
(a) Subject to Article 10 of the Indenture, the Guaranteeing Subsidiary hereby, jointly and severally with all other Guarantors, unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of the Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Issuers hereunder or thereunder, that:
(i) the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Issuers to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and
 
(ii) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, that same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise.
Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately.
(b) The obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or the Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Issuers, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor, other than payment in full of all Obligations under the Notes.
(c) The following is hereby waived: diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Issuers, any right to require a proceeding first against the Issuers, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever.
(d) This Securities Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and the Indenture, and the Guaranteeing Subsidiary accepts all obligations of a Guarantor under the Indenture.
(e) If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Issuers, the Guarantors, or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Issuers or the Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Securities Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect.
(f) The Guaranteeing Subsidiary shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby.
(g) As between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 of the Indenture for the purposes of this Securities Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration
 
of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 6 of the Indenture, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Securities Guarantee.
(h) The Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any nonpaying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under this Securities Guarantee.
(i) In accordance with Section 10.02 of the Indenture, after giving effect to any maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities that are relevant under any applicable Bankruptcy Law or fraudulent conveyance law, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under Article 10 of the Indenture, this Securities Guarantee shall be limited to the maximum amount permissible such that the obligations of such Guarantor under this Securities Guarantee will not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
3. . The Guaranteeing Subsidiary agrees that this Securities Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Note a notation of such Securities Guarantee.
Execution and Delivery
4. .
Guaranteeing Subsidiary may Consolidate, etc., on Certain Terms
(a) The Guaranteeing Subsidiary may not sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to, or consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not the Guaranteeing Subsidiary is the surviving Person) another Person, other than the Issuers or another Guarantor unless:
(i) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and
(ii) subject to Section 10.05 of the Indenture, the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger assumes all of the obligations of the Guaranteeing Subsidiary under the Indenture and this Securities Guarantee pursuant to a supplemental indenture in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee.
(b) In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance and upon the assumption by the successor Person, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of this Securities Guarantee endorsed upon the Notes and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of the Indenture to be performed by the Guaranteeing Subsidiary, such successor Person shall succeed to and be substituted for the Guaranteeing Subsidiary with the same effect as if it had been named herein as a Guaranteeing Subsidiary. Such successor Person thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Securities Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the Notes issuable under the Indenture which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Issuers and delivered to the Trustee. All the Securities Guarantees so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under the Indenture
 
as the Securities Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of the Indenture as though all of such Securities Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.
(c) Except as set forth in Articles 4 and 5 and Section 10.04 of the Indenture, and notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, nothing contained in the Indenture or in any of the Notes shall prevent any consolidation or merger of the Guaranteeing Subsidiary with or into the Issuers or another Guarantor, or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of the Guaranteeing Subsidiary as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Issuers or another Guarantor.
5. .
Releases
(a) The Securities Guarantee of a Guaranteeing Subsidiary shall be released, and any Person acquiring assets (including by way of merger or consolidation) or Capital Stock of a Guaranteeing Subsidiary under those circumstances specified in Section 10.05 of the Indenture shall not be required to assume the obligations of such Guaranteeing Subsidiary. The Securities Guarantee of a Guaranteeing Subsidiary shall also be released in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.06 of the Indenture. Upon delivery by the Issuers to the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the provisions of Section 10.05 or Section 10.06, as applicable, of the Indenture have been complied with, the Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence the release of the Guaranteeing Subsidiary from its obligations under this Securities Guarantee.
(b) Any Guarantor not released from its obligations under its Securities Guarantee shall remain liable for the full amount of principal of and interest on the Notes and for the other obligations of any Guarantor under the Indenture as provided in Article 10 of the Indenture.
6. . No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, stockholder or agent of the Guaranteeing Subsidiary, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuers or the Guaranteeing Subsidiary under the Notes, this Securities Guarantee, the Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of the Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the Commission that such a waiver is against public policy.
No Recourse Against Others
7. . THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL GOVERN AND BE USED TO CONSTRUE THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE BUT WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY.
NEW YORK LAW TO GOVERN
