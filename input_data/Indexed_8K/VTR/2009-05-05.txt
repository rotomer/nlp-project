On May 5, 2009, Ventas, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2009.
A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated in this Item 2.02 by reference.
The press release states that the Company's normalized funds from operations ("FFO") for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 were $95.7 million, or $0.67 per diluted common share, as compared to $91.5 million, or $0.67 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2008. FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, was $94.5 million, or $0.66 per diluted common share, in the first quarter of 2009, compared to $101.3 million, or $0.74 per diluted common share, in the first quarter of 2008. The Company's net income attributable to common stockholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 was $74.2 million, or $0.52 per diluted common share (after discontinued operations of $28.3 million), versus $31.2 million, or $0.23 per diluted common share (after discontinued operations of $1.5 million), for the comparable 2008 period.
The press release also states that the Company expects its normalized FFO for the year ending December 31, 2009 to be between $2.48 and $2.58 per diluted common share. The Company expects its net income attributable to common stockholders for 2009 to be between $1.56 and $1.65 per diluted common share.
This Current Report on Form 8-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements regarding the Company's or its tenants', operators', managers' or borrowers' expected future financial position, results of operations, cash flows, funds from operations, dividends and dividend plans, financing plans, business strategy, budgets, projected costs, capital expenditures, competitive positions, acquisitions, investment opportunities, merger integration, growth opportunities, dispositions, expected lease income, continued qualification as a real estate investment trust ("REIT"), plans and objectives of management for future operations and statements that include words such as "anticipate," "if," "believe," "plan," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "could," "should," "will" and other similar expressions are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and security holders must recognize that actual results may differ from the Company's expectations. The Company does not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made.
The Company's actual future results and trends may differ materially from expectations depending on a variety of factors discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These factors include without limitation: (a) the ability and willingness of the Company's operators, tenants, borrowers, managers and other third parties to meet and/or perform their obligations under their respective contractual arrangements with the Company, including, in some cases, their obligations to
indemnify, defend and hold the Company harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities; (b) the ability of the Company's operators, tenants, borrowers and managers to maintain the financial strength and liquidity necessary to satisfy their respective obligations and liabilities to third parties, including without limitation obligations under their existing credit facilities and other indebtedness; (c) the Company's success in implementing its business strategy and its ability to identify, underwrite, consummate, finance and integrate diversifying acquisitions or investments, including those in different asset types and outside the United States; (d) the nature and extent of future competition; (e) the extent of future or pending healthcare reform and regulation, including cost containment measures and changes in reimbursement policies, procedures and rates; (f) increases in the Company's cost of borrowing as a result of changes in interest rates and other factors; (g) the ability of the Company's operators and managers, as applicable, to deliver high quality services, to attract and retain qualified personnel and to attract residents and patients; (h) the results of litigation affecting the Company; (i) changes in general economic conditions and/or economic conditions in the markets in which the Company may, from time to time, compete, and the effect of those changes on the Company's revenues and its ability to access the capital markets or other sources of funds; (j) the Company's ability to pay down, refinance, restructure and/or extend its indebtedness as it becomes due; (k) the Company's ability and willingness to maintain its qualification as a REIT due to economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations; (l) final determination of the Company's taxable net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 and for the year ending December 31, 2009; (m) the ability and willingness of the Company's tenants to renew their leases with the Company upon expiration of the leases and the Company's ability to reposition its properties on the same or better terms in the event such leases expire and are not renewed by the Company's tenants or in the event the Company exercises its right to replace an existing tenant upon default; (n) risks associated with the Company's senior living operating portfolio, such as factors causing volatility in the Company's operating income and earnings generated by its properties, including without limitation national and regional economic conditions, costs of materials, energy, labor and services, employee benefit costs and professional and general liability claims, and the timely delivery of accurate property-level financial results for those properties; (o) the movement of U.S. and Canadian exchange rates; (p) year-over-year changes in the Consumer Price Index and the effect of those changes on the rent escalators, including the rent escalator for Master Lease 2 with Kindred, and the Company's earnings; (q) the Company's ability and the ability of its operators, tenants, borrowers and managers to obtain and maintain adequate liability and other insurance from reputable and financially stable providers; (r) the impact of increased operating costs and uninsured professional liability claims on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of the Company's operators, tenants, borrowers and managers, and the ability of the Company's operators, tenants, borrowers and managers to accurately estimate the magnitude of those claims; (s) the ability and willingness of the lenders under the Company's unsecured revolving credit facilities to fund, in whole or in part, borrowing requests made by the Company from time to time; (t) the impact of market or issuer events on the liquidity or value of the Company's investments in marketable securities; and (u) the impact of any financial, accounting, legal or regulatory issues that may affect the Company's major tenants, operators or managers. Many of these factors are beyond the control of the Company and its management.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") said today that first quarter 2009 normalized Funds From Operations ("FFO") increased five percent to $95.7 million, from $91.5 million for the comparable 2008 period. Normalized FFO per diluted common share was $0.67 in the first quarter of 2009, even with the comparable 2008 period.
CHICAGO, IL (May 5, 2009)
"We had an excellent first quarter, with seven percent growth in our cash flow from operations, and our capital raising activities are building strength on strength," Ventas Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Debra A. Cafaro said. "In addition, our recent agreement with our valued tenant Kindred Healthcare to renew its leases for 109 healthcare assets until 2015 enhances the reliability of our future cash flows and continues our increasingly collaborative relationship with Kindred."
First quarter normalized FFO per share benefited from rental increases from the Company's triple-net lease portfolio, higher revenues at the Company's medical office building ("MOB") operating portfolio, additional investments and lower interest expense, offset in part by lower Net Operating Income after management fees ("NOI") at the Company's senior living operating portfolio, the movements in foreign exchange rates and higher weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2009 were 143.1 million, compared to 136.7 million in 2008. Normalized FFO for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 excludes the net expense (totaling $1.2 million, or $0.01 per share) from merger-related expenses and deal costs and loss on extinguishment of debt, offset by income tax benefit.
FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), for the first quarter of 2009 decreased seven percent to $94.5 million, from $101.3 million in the prior year. First quarter 2009 NAREIT FFO per diluted common share decreased eleven percent to $0.66, from $0.74 a year earlier due to the above stated factors.
SUNRISE PORTFOLIO
Total Portfolio
The Company's operating portfolio contains 79 seniors housing communities in North America that are managed by Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (NYSE: SRZ) ("Sunrise"). Ventas owns 100 percent of 19 of these communities and has a partnership share of between 75 percent and 85 percent in the remaining 60 communities, with Sunrise owning the noncontrolling interest in those 60 communities.

NOI for those 79 communities was $30.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2009, compared to $33.4 million for the comparable 2008 period. The decrease, which was consistent with the Company's NOI guidance, relates principally to the movements in the Canadian dollar exchange rate, which had an unfavorable impact on NOI of $1.2 million in 2009, and lower revenue in the stabilized portfolio versus the comparable 2008 period.
73 Same-Store Stabilized Community Results
For the 73 Sunrise communities that were stabilized in the first quarters of both 2009 and 2008, total community NOI was $28.3 million in 2009, versus $32.7 million for the comparable 2008 period. Movements in the Canadian dollar exchange rate had an unfavorable impact on NOI of $1.1 million for the first quarter of 2009, compared to the first quarter of 2008.
GAAP NET INCOME
Net income attributable to common stockholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 was $74.2 million, or $0.52 per diluted common share, after discontinued operations of $28.3 million, compared with net income attributable to common stockholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 of $31.2 million, or $0.23 per diluted common share, after discontinued operations of $1.5 million.

UPDATED 2009 NORMALIZED FFO GUIDANCE
Ventas currently expects its 2009 normalized FFO per diluted share to be between $2.48 and $2.58, as compared to previous 2009 guidance of $2.55 to $2.65 per diluted share. This per share adjustment in expectations is due to the Company's successful offering of $480 million in equity and senior notes, the extension and amendment of its Credit Facilities, and announced acquisitions and dispositions. The Company continues to expect its 79 high-quality seniors housing assets operated by Sunrise to generate between $110 million and $125 million in NOI for the full year.
"Increasing liquidity, paying off near term maturities and improving our balance sheet create value for our stakeholders that far outweighs the modest earnings adjustment resulting from our successful capital raises," Cafaro said. "We have shown the ability to access multiple capital markets this year, demonstrating the quality of our assets, the safety of our business model and the size of our platform. As a result, Ventas is well positioned to weather a continued economic downturn and to invest opportunistically and accretively when the time is right."
The Company's normalized FFO guidance for all periods assumes that all of the Company's tenants and borrowers continue to meet all of their obligations to the Company. In addition, the Company's normalized FFO guidance (and related GAAP earnings projections) excludes (a) gains and losses on the sales of assets, (b) the impact of future unannounced acquisitions or divestitures (including pursuant to tenant options to purchase) and capital transactions, (c) merger-related costs and expenses that are not capitalized under GAAP, including expenses relating to the Company's lawsuit against HCP, (d) the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of the Company's debt, (e) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses, (f) deal costs and expenses and earnout payments required by GAAP to be expensed rather than capitalized into asset cost, and (g) the reversal or incurrence of contingent liabilities.
The Company's guidance is based on a number of other assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position No. APB 14-1, "Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)" ("APB 14-1"). APB 14-1 specifies that issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. Additionally, on January 1, 2009, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51" ("SFAS No. 160"). SFAS No. 160 changes the reporting for minority interests, which now must be characterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of consolidated equity. The calculation of income and earnings per share continues to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent and is characterized as net income attributable to common stockholders. As required, all prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the adoption of APB 14-1 and SFAS No. 160.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO and FAD appropriate measures of performance of an equity REIT. The Company uses the NAREIT definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding

gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FAD represents normalized FFO excluding straight-line rental adjustments and routine capital expenditures.
FFO and FAD presented herein are not necessarily comparable to FFO and FAD presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Neither FFO nor FAD should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO or FAD necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO and FAD should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
The Company's normalized FFO excludes (a) gains and losses on the sales of assets, (b) merger-related costs and expenses that are not capitalized under GAAP, including expenses relating to the Company's lawsuit against HCP, (c) the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts or premiums incurred as a result of early debt retirement or payment of the Company's debt, (d) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits, (e) acquisition costs and expenses and earnout payments required by GAAP to be expensed rather than capitalized into asset cost beginning in 2009, and (f) the reversal of contingent liabilities.

Net Debt to Pro Forma EBITDA
The following pro forma information considers the effect on net income, interest and depreciation of the Company's investments and other capital transactions that were completed during the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2009, as if the transactions had been consummated as of the beginning of the period. The following table illustrates net debt to pro forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") as of March 31, 2009 and pro forma net debt to pro forma EBITDA as of May 4, 2009, which considers the effect on net debt as of March 31, 2009 of the Company's equity issuance, senior notes issuance and tenders of the senior notes and other debt repayments through May 4, 2009 (dollars in thousands):
 
The Company considers EBITDA a profitability measure which indicates the Company's ability to service debt. The Company considers the net debt to pro forma EBITDA ratio a useful measure to evaluate the Company's ability to pay its indebtedness. EBITDA presented herein is not necessarily comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is EBITDA necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, EBITDA should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere in this press release.
