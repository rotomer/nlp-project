Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On February 27, 2011, Ventas, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Needles Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and newly formed subsidiary of the Company ("Merger Sub"), and Nationwide Health Properties, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("NHP").
     The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of NHP with and into Merger Sub (the "Merger"), with Merger Sub surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of NHP (other than shares owned directly or indirectly by the Company, any Company subsidiary or any subsidiary of NHP, which shares will be canceled) will be converted into the right to receive 0.7866 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of common stock, par value $0.25 per share ("Common Stock"), of the Company.
     The Company and NHP have made certain customary representations and warranties to each other in the Merger Agreement. In addition, the parties have agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to do all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger, including obtaining all necessary approvals and consents, subject to certain limitations.
     The consummation of the Merger (the "Closing") is subject to, among other things, approval by the Company's and NHP's shareholders. The Company expects the Closing to occur in the third quarter of 2011, although there can be no assurance as to whether or when the Closing will occur.
     The Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances, including by either party if the consummation of the Merger has not occurred by October 31, 2011, if an order permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement has been issued and become final and non-appealable, if the Company's or NHP's stockholders fail to approve the transaction, or upon a material uncured breach by the other party that would cause the closing conditions not to be satisfied.
     A copy of the Merger Agreement is filed herewith as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated in this Item 1.01 by reference. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement were made as of a specified date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what might be viewed as material to stockholders, or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties. Accordingly, the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement are not necessarily characterizations of the actual state of facts about the Company or NHP at the time they were made or otherwise and should only be read in conjunction with the other information that the Company makes publicly available in reports, statements and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") and Nationwide Health Properties, Inc. (NYSE: NHP) ("NHP") today announced that the Boards of Directors of both companies have unanimously approved a definitive agreement under which Ventas will acquire all of the outstanding shares of NHP in a stock-for-stock transaction valued at $7.4 billion, creating one of the largest publicly traded REITs and the leading healthcare REIT by equity value.
Chicago, IL and Newport Beach, CA  February 28, 2011
          Under the terms of the agreement, NHP shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.7866 Ventas shares for each share of NHP common stock they own. Based on the closing stock price for Ventas on Friday, February 25, 2011, this consideration would be equivalent to $44.99 of Ventas stock for each NHP share, representing a premium to NHP shareholders of approximately 15% over NHP's closing stock price on that day. Upon closing of the transaction, Ventas shareholders are expected to own approximately 65% and NHP shareholders are expected to own approximately 35% of the combined company. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Ventas's normalized Funds From Operations ("FFO") and Funds Available for Distribution ("FAD") after the closing, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2011. The all-stock transaction is intended to be tax-free to shareholders. (All figures for Ventas and the combined company are pro forma for Ventas's previously announced transaction to acquire substantially all of the real estate assets of privately-owned Atria Senior Living Group ("Atria"), which is expected to close in April 2011.)

          "The combination of Ventas and NHP increases the scale and diversification of the combined company, the strength and flexibility of the company's balance sheet and the quality and geography of the assets," Ventas Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Debra A. Cafaro said. "With Ventas's successful track record of value-creating transactions and NHP's longstanding history of regional, asset-level acquisitions, taken together with one of the strongest balance sheets in the REIT industry, the combined company will have a unique opportunity for continued external growth. We are excited to move forward with the NHP team. This combination unites two similar cultures that share core values and a strong track record of delivering superior returns to shareholders."
          "For NHP shareholders, Ventas is the right partner, bringing the right value at the right time. After 25 wonderful years of growth and success, we look forward to joining forces with Ventas, which shares our legacy of financial strength and top-tier returns for shareholders," said Douglas M. Pasquale, NHP's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our shareholders, property operators and tenants will all benefit from our expanded strength, diversification and capabilities. We're pleased that this all-stock transaction offers NHP shareholders a premium and also the opportunity to participate in the combined company's future prospects for dividends and growth. I am personally committed to ensuring a smooth transition and the completion of the transaction as expeditiously as possible."
