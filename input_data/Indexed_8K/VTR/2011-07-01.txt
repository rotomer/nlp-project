As previously announced, on June 20, 2011, the Company's Board of Directors declared a prorated dividend (the "Dividend") on the Company's common stock, conditioned upon the completion of its acquisition of NHP pursuant to a merger of NHP with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the "Merger"). In connection with the completion of the Merger on July 1, 2011, the Dividend is payable in cash as soon as practicable on or after July 1, 2011 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 30, 2011 (the last business day prior to the date on which the Merger became effective), and the per share dividend amount payable by the Company is equal to $0.1264 (the Company's most recent quarterly dividend rate ($0.575), multiplied by the number of days elapsed since the Company's last dividend record date (June 10, 2011) through and including the day immediately prior to the day on which the Merger became effective, divided by the actual number of days in the calendar quarter in which such dividend was declared (91)).
