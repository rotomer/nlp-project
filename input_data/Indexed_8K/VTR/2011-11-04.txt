The press release states that the Companys normalized funds from operations (FFO) for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 was $255.1 million, or $0.88 per diluted common share, as compared to $115.4 million, or $0.73 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2010.  The Companys net income attributable to common stockholders for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 was $102.9 million, or $0.35 per diluted common share, as compared to $57.9 million, or $0.37 per diluted common share (after discontinued operations of $0.5 million), for the comparable period in 2010.

(c) the Companys success in implementing its business strategy and the Companys ability to identify, underwrite, finance, consummate and integrate diversifying acquisitions or investments, including the Nationwide Health Properties, Inc. transaction and those in different asset types and outside the United States; (d) macroeconomic conditions such as a disruption of or lack of access to the capital markets, changes in the debt rating on U.S. government securities, default and/or delay in payment by the United States of its obligations, and changes in the federal budget resulting in the reduction or nonpayment of Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement rates; (e) the nature and extent of future competition; (f) the extent of future or pending healthcare reform and regulation, including cost containment measures and changes in reimbursement policies, procedures and rates; (g) increases in the Companys cost of borrowing as a result of changes in interest rates and other factors; (h) the ability of the Companys operators and managers, as applicable, to deliver high quality services, to attract and retain qualified personnel and to attract residents and patients; (i) changes in general economic conditions and/or economic conditions in the markets in which the Company may, from time to time, compete, and the effect of those changes on the Companys revenues and its ability to access the capital markets or other sources of funds; (j) the Companys ability to pay down, refinance, restructure and/or extend its indebtedness as it becomes due; (k) the Companys ability and willingness to maintain its qualification as a REIT due to economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations; (l) final determination of the Companys taxable net income for the year ending December 31, 2011; (m) the ability and willingness of the Companys tenants to renew their leases with the Company upon expiration of the leases and the Companys ability to reposition its properties on the same or better terms in the event such leases expire and are not renewed by the Companys tenants or in the event the Company exercises its right to replace an existing tenant upon default; (n) risks associated with the Companys senior living operating portfolio, such as factors causing volatility in the Companys operating income and earnings generated by its properties, including without limitation national and regional economic conditions, costs of materials, energy, labor and services, employee benefit costs, insurance costs and professional and general liability claims, and the timely delivery of accurate property-level financial results for those properties; (o) the movement of U.S. and Canadian exchange rates; (p) year-over-year changes in the Consumer Price Index and the effect of those changes on the rent escalators, including the rent escalator for Master Lease 2 with Kindred Healthcare, Inc., and the Companys earnings; (q) the Companys ability and the ability of its tenants, operators, borrowers and managers to obtain and maintain adequate liability and other insurance from reputable and financially stable providers; (r) the impact of increased operating costs and uninsured professional liability claims on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of the Companys tenants, operators, borrowers and managers, and the ability of the Companys tenants, operators, borrowers and managers to accurately estimate the magnitude of those claims; (s) risks associated with the Companys medical office building (MOB) portfolio and operations, including its ability to successfully design, develop and manage MOBs, to accurately estimate its costs in fixed fee-for-service projects and to retain key personnel; (t) the ability of the hospitals on or near whose campuses the Companys MOBs are located and their affiliated health systems to remain competitive and financially viable and to attract physicians and physician groups; (u) the Companys ability to maintain or expand its relationships with its existing and future hospital and health system clients; (v) risks associated with the Companys investments in joint ventures and unconsolidated entities, including its lack of sole decision-making authority and its reliance on its joint venture partners financial condition; (w) the impact of market or issuer events on the liquidity or value of the Companys investments in marketable securities; and (x) the impact of any financial, accounting, legal or regulatory issues or litigation that may affect the Company or its major tenants, operators or managers.  Many of these factors are beyond the control of the Company and its management.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) (Ventas or the Company) said today that  normalized Funds From Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 increased approximately 120 percent to $255.1 million, from $115.4 million for the comparable 2010 period.  Normalized FFO per diluted common share was $0.88 for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, an increase of 20.5 percent from $0.73 for the comparable 2010 period.  Weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the third quarter of 2011 rose by 84.1 percent to 290.8 million, compared to 157.9 million in the comparable 2010 period.
CHICAGO, IL (November 4, 2011)
 
Our outstanding third quarter performance benefited greatly from the acquisitions of Nationwide Health Properties and Atria, which were accretive to earnings, expanded and diversified our portfolio, and improved our balance sheet and credit ratings, Ventas Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Debra A. Cafaro said.  Today we are a stronger Company, with multiple avenues of growth and a diversified portfolio of over 1,300 productive healthcare and seniors housing assets generating $1.4 billion in net operating income, the vast majority of which comes from private pay sources.
 
Consistent with the Companys previous statements, normalized FFO for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 excludes the net benefit (totaling $9.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted share) from net litigation proceeds and income tax benefit, partially offset by merger-related expenses and deal costs (including integration costs), mark-to-market adjustment for derivatives, loss on extinguishment of debt and amortization of other intangibles.  Normalized FFO for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 excluded the net expense (totaling $6.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share) from merger-related expenses and deal costs (including integration costs), amortization of other intangibles and non-cash income tax expense.
 
Third quarter 2011 normalized FFO per diluted common share versus the comparable period in 2010 benefited from the Companys acquisition of Nationwide Health Properties, Inc. (NHP) and 117 properties managed by Atria Senior Living, Inc. (Atria), rental increases from the Companys triple-net lease portfolio, higher Net Operating Income after management fees at the Companys 79 private pay senior living communities managed by Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (NYSE: SRZ) (Sunrise), and higher Net Operating Income from the Companys medical office building (MOB) portfolio, partially offset by increases in general and administrative expenses (including stock-based compensation) as a result of the Companys enterprise growth, higher interest expense and higher weighted average diluted shares outstanding.

Normalized FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was $517.6 million, or $2.45 per diluted common share, a 16.1 percent increase per diluted common share from $332.5 million, or $2.11 per diluted common share, for the comparable 2010 period.  Normalized FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 excludes the net expense (totaling $51.8 million, or $0.25 per diluted share) from merger-related expenses and deal costs (including integration costs), loss on extinguishment of debt, mark-to-market adjustment for derivatives and amortization of other intangibles, partially offset by net litigation proceeds and income tax benefit.
 
Net income attributable to common stockholders for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 was $102.9 million, or $0.35 per diluted common share, compared with net income attributable to common stockholders for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 of $57.9 million, or $0.37 per diluted common share, including discontinued operations of $0.5 million.  This increase in net income attributable to common stockholders is primarily the result of the NHP acquisition and a net benefit of $9.2 million due to the factors described above for normalized FFO.
 
Net income attributable to common stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was $171.5 million, or $0.81 per diluted common share, compared with net income attributable to common stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 of $168.6 million, or $1.07 per diluted common share, including discontinued operations of $7.1 million.

FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 increased over 142 percent to $264.2 million, from $108.9 million in the comparable 2010 period. Third quarter 2011 NAREIT FFO per diluted common share increased 31.9 percent to $0.91, from $0.69 in the third quarter of 2010.  This increase is primarily due to the factors described above for net income.
 
NAREIT FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 increased 48.7 percent to $465.8 million, from $313.2 million in the comparable 2010 period. NAREIT FFO per diluted common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 increased 11.1 percent to $2.21, from $1.99 in 2010.  This increase is primarily due to the factors described above for net income.
 
PRIVATE PAY SENIORS HOUSING OPERATING PORTFOLIO
 
At September 30, 2011, the Companys seniors housing operating portfolio included 79 private pay seniors housing communities managed by Sunrise and 117 private pay seniors housing communities managed by Atria.
 
Net Operating Income after management fees (NOI) for the Sunrise-managed communities was $40.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, compared to $39.0 million for the comparable 2010 period.  The comparable 2010 period included the benefit to NOI of a $2 million cash payment from Sunrise for expense overages.  Average daily resident occupancy increased 120 basis points to 90.6 percent versus the prior period, and the average daily rate increased by 4.1 percent to $184.
 
NOI for the Atria-managed communities was $47.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 (Ventass first full quarter of ownership).  Average unit occupancy for the total portfolio increased 60 basis points to 87.4 percent, compared to 86.8 percent in June 2011.

The Companys normalized FFO guidance (and related GAAP earnings projections) for all periods assumes that all of the Companys tenants and borrowers continue to meet all of their obligations to the Company. In addition, the Companys normalized FFO guidance excludes (a) gains and losses on the sales of real property assets, (b) merger-related costs and expenses, including amortization of intangibles and transition and integration expenses, and deal costs and expenses, including expenses and recoveries relating to the Companys lawsuit against HCP, (c) the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of the Companys debt, (d) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses and derivative transactions that have non-cash mark-to-market impacts on the Companys income statement, (e) the impact of future unannounced acquisitions or divestitures (including pursuant to tenant options to purchase) and capital transactions, and (f) the reversal or incurrence of contingent consideration and liabilities.
 
The Companys guidance is based on a number of other assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Companys expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.
 
A reconciliation of the Companys guidance to the Companys projected GAAP earnings is attached to this press release. The Company may from time to time update its publicly announced guidance, but it is not obligated to do so.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.  Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves.  To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO and normalized FFO appropriate measures of operating performance of an equity REIT.  Moreover, the Company believes that normalized FFO provides useful information because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to compare the Companys operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated items.  The Company uses the NAREIT definition of FFO.  NAREIT defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.  The Company defines normalized FFO as FFO excluding the following income and expense items (which may be recurring in nature): (a) gains and losses on the sales of real property assets, (b) merger-related costs and expenses, including amortization of intangibles and transition and integration expenses, and deal costs and expenses, including expenses and recoveries relating to the Companys lawsuit against HCP, (c) the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of the Companys debt, (d) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses, (e) the impact of future unannounced acquisitions or divestitures (including pursuant to tenant options to purchase) and capital transactions, (f) the reversal or incurrence of contingent consideration and liabilities, and (g) changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps.
 
FFO and normalized FFO presented herein are not necessarily comparable to FFO and normalized FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions.  FFO and normalized FFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of the Companys financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of the Companys liquidity, nor are FFO and normalized FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Companys needs.  The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO and normalized FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere herein.

The following information considers the pro forma effect on net income, interest and depreciation of the Companys investments and other capital transactions that were completed during the three months ended September 30, 2011, as if the transactions had been consummated as of the beginning of the period.  The following table illustrates net debt to pro forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (including of non-cash stock-based compensation), excluding merger-related expenses and deal costs, gains or losses on sales of real property assets and changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps (Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA) (dollars in thousands):

The Company believes that NOI, same-store cash rental income and same-store NOI provide useful information because those disclosures allow investors, analysts and Company management to measure unlevered property-level operating results and to compare the Companys operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis.  Those terms are commonly used in evaluating results of real estate companies.  The Company defines NOI as total revenues, excluding interest and other income, less property-level operating expenses and medical office building services costs (including amounts in discontinued operations).
