Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On December 24, 2011, Ventas, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with TH Merger Corp, Inc., a Maryland corporation and the Company's wholly owned subsidiary ("MergerSub"), TH Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the Company's wholly owned subsidiary ("OP MergerSub"), Cogdell Spencer Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Cogdell"), and Cogdell Spencer LP, a Delaware limited partnership ("Cogdell LP").
 
The Merger Agreement provides for (i) either (A) the merger of MergerSub with and into Cogdell, with Cogdell surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or (B) the merger of Cogdell with and into MergerSub, with MergerSub surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and (ii) the merger of OP MergerSub with and into Cogdell LP, with Cogdell LP surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the "Mergers"). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), (a) each share of Cogdell common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Common Stock held by Cogdell, the Company, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries) will be converted into the right to receive $4.25 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"), (b) each unit of limited partnership interest in Cogdell LP ("OP Unit") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any OP Units held by Cogdell, the Company, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and (c) each share of Cogdell's 8.500% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the "Series A Preferred Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by Cogdell, the Company, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries), will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $25, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends through and including the date of the closing of the Mergers (the "Closing"), without interest.  In addition, each share of Cogdell restricted stock and each Cogdell LP long-term incentive plan unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will fully vest and be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
 
The parties have made certain customary representations and warranties to each other in the Merger Agreement. In addition, the parties have agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to do all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including obtaining all necessary approvals and consents, subject to certain limitations.  Under the Merger Agreement, Cogdell is subject to a customary "no-shop" restriction on its ability to solicit offers or proposals relating to an acquisition proposal or to provide information to or engage in discussions or negotiations with third parties regarding an acquisition proposal.
 
The Closing is subject to, among other things, approval by the holders of Cogdell Common Stock and the sale of the assets and companies comprising Cogdell's design-build and development business ("Erdman") pursuant to the terms of the Erdman Purchase Agreement (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement).
 
The Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances, including by either party if the consummation of the Merger has not occurred by June 29, 2012, if Cogdell's stockholders fail to approve the transaction, upon a material uncured breach by the other party that would cause the closing conditions not to be satisfied or if Cogdell accepts a Superior Proposal (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) or if Cogdell's Board of Directors makes an Adverse Recommendation Change (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement).
 
The Merger Agreement provides that, upon termination under specified circumstances, Cogdell would be required to pay the Company a termination fee in an amount equal to $15,000,000 (plus expense reimbursement of $5,000,000 in certain circumstances). The Merger Agreement also provides that the Company will be required to pay to Cogdell a reverse termination fee of $15,000,000 (plus expense reimbursement of $5,000,000) upon termination under specified circumstances.
 
A copy of the Merger Agreement is filed herewith as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated in this Item 1.01 by reference.  The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement were made as of a specified date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what might be viewed as material to stockholders, or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties.  Accordingly, the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement are not necessarily characterizations of the actual state of facts about the Company, MergerSub, OP MergerSub, Cogdell or Cogdell LP at the time they were made or otherwise and should only be read in conjunction with the other information that the Company makes publicly available in reports, statements and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
CHICAGO, IL and CHARLOTTE, NC (December 27, 2011)
Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) ("Ventas" or the "Company") and Cogdell Spencer Inc. (NYSE: CSA) ("Cogdell") today announced that the Boards of Directors of both companies have approved a definitive agreement under which Ventas will acquire Cogdell and its 72 high quality medical office buildings ("MOBs") in an all-cash transaction.  At closing, Ventas's investment, including its share of debt, is expected to approximate $760 million to $770 million, before anticipated transaction expenses.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, holders of shares of Cogdell common stock and units of limited partnership interests in Cogdell's operating partnership, Cogdell Spencer LP ("Cogdell LP"), will receive consideration of $4.25 per share (or unit), representing a premium of 8% to Cogdell's closing price on December 23, 2011 and 13% to the average closing price of Cogdell common stock over the past 30 days.  The consideration plus anticipated transaction expenses values Cogdell's properties at a low- to mid- 7% net operating income ("NOI") yield, or slightly over $200 per square foot.  Holders of Cogdell's preferred stock will receive consideration of $25 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the closing.  Cogdell will pay its currently declared common stock dividend as scheduled on January 19, 2012, at which time Cogdell LP will pay a similar distribution on its outstanding limited partnership units.  Cogdell and Cogdell LP will not pay further dividends or distributions on their common stock or units pending consummation of the transaction.
 
"We are delighted to announce this strategic and accretive acquisition that further broadens our footprint in the attractive MOB sector, continues to diversify our business and tenant relationships and keeps our balance sheet strong," Ventas Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Debra A. Cafaro said.  "Cogdell's high-quality properties enhance our medical office building market presence, especially in the southeast, and provide an opportunity to scale our Lillibridge
 
 
Healthcare Services subsidiary platform.  We look forward to successfully integrating the Cogdell properties into the Ventas portfolio."
 
Highlights of the acquired assets are:
 
                 
Acquired MOBs: 68 stabilized (92% occupied), 2 leaseup and 2 in development, 4.2 million square feet;
                 
Management business acquired: 44 MOBs, 2 million square feet;
                 
Ventas's MOB portfolio will increase from 11% to 15% of total NOI;
                 
Owned MOBs are located in 15 states;
                 
Eighty-eight percent of the owned portfolio's square footage (72 MOBs) is located on hospital campuses or is hospital anchored; and
                 
Twelve new business relationships with investment-grade rated hospitals.
 
"When this acquisition is completed, Ventas will have the leading MOB business in the U.S., with over 20 million square feet owned or managed, and a coast-to-coast presence that is second to none in the healthcare real estate industry," Ventas Executive Vice President of Medical Property Operations Todd W. Lillibridge said.  "We continue to build on our 25 years of experience exclusively in the medical office building and outpatient arena for the benefit of our clients and stakeholders."
 
"We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Ventas, which provides immediate, full and fair value to our shareholders," Cogdell Spencer's Chief Executive Officer and President Raymond Braun said.  "Our Board of Directors conducted a robust and thorough review of strategic alternatives and determined that this transaction is advisable to, and in the best interests of, our shareholders.  In reaching this decision to sell, the Board carefully considered our prospects to raise capital in support of our growth strategy.  The Board is unequivocal in its view that the sale to Ventas will deliver the most value to shareholders.  I look forward to working with the Ventas team to facilitate a seamless and successful integration."
 
Cogdell has reached an agreement under which Cogdell's design-build and development business ("Erdman") will be sold to an affiliate of Lubar & Co., a well regarded private equity firm affiliated with David Lubar, prior to completion of the Ventas transaction.  Mr. Lubar previously held an equity stake in Erdman before it was sold to Cogdell in 2008.  The transaction will include all assets and liabilities of the Erdman business, including approximately $11 million in projected net working capital on the Erdman balance sheet.  In addition, Cogdell will contribute approximately $12 million to its equity capitalization, with a roughly equal amount to be contributed by an affiliate of Lubar & Co, in order to capitalize Erdman.  The agreement currently contemplates the sale of Erdman for nominal consideration but allows Cogdell to solicit superior proposals for the Erdman business over a 45-day period.  Cogdell shareholders would receive any additional proceeds resulting from a sale of the Erdman business to an alternative party, less incremental costs associated with such sale.
 
Ventas's acquisition of Cogdell is expected to be financed through the assumption of existing Cogdell mortgage debt and other Ventas borrowings.
 
The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Ventas's normalized funds from operations (FFO), approximately $0.03 to $0.05 per share on a full year basis excluding merger-related, transition and integration costs and expenses.  In addition, Ventas anticipates that Cogdell's debt balances are expected to increase, and its cash balance expected to decrease, between now and the closing principally due to Cogdell's ongoing development projects and its contribution to Erdman.  Ventas expects its net debt to EBITDA to approximate 5x including the acquisition.
 
Approvals and Timing
 
Completion of Ventas's acquisition of Cogdell, which is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2012, is subject to the approval of Cogdell shareholders, satisfaction of customary closing conditions and the successful completion of the sale of Erdman.
 
Advisors
 
Centerview Partners LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC are acting as financial advisors to Ventas, and Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP is acting as legal counsel.
 
Citi is acting as exclusive financial advisor to Cogdell and provided a fairness opinion, and Alston & Bird LLP is acting as legal counsel.

A MESSAGE FROM Debra Cafaro and Ray Braun, CEO
 
December 27, 2011
 
Dear Cogdell Employee,
 
This morning we announced that Cogdell and Ventas have entered into a definitive agreement under which Ventas will acquire Cogdell.  Separately, Cogdell has agreed to sell its design-build and development business ("Erdman") to an affiliate of Lubar & Co., a well regarded private equity firm affiliated with David Lubar.  You can read the press release we issued at (www.cogdell.com).
 
We anticipate a closing in the second quarter of 2012, subject to certain conditions in the agreement. We look forward to a bright future together, building on our companies' strengths in the communities we serve.  We firmly believe Cogdell's operating assets, experience and customer service focus will complement and enhance Ventas's longstanding commitment to serving clients' healthcare real estate needs.
 
For those of you who may not know Ventas, we are a Chicago-based, publicly traded real estate investment trust that owns more than 1,300 healthcare properties across North America.  With an enterprise value exceeding $20 billion and three investment grade ratings, Ventas is a member of the S&P 500, and has an excellent reputation for its significant financial strength, flexibility and value creation for shareholders.  Upon close of the transaction, Ventas will own or manage over 20 million square feet in MOBs, enjoy relationships with over 50 leading hospitals and health systems, and maintain a coast-to-coast presence in the healthcare real estate industry.
 
Ventas's medical office properties are operated through its subsidiary, Lillibridge Healthcare Services, a national leader in medical office building ownership, management and development.  Lillibridge has 25 years of experience in serving physicians, hospitals and health systems across the country.  More information about Ventas and Lillibridge can be found at www.ventasreit.com and www.lillibridge.com, respectively.
 
It's important that each of you continue to focus on performing your roles and responsibilities over the coming weeks and months. Cogdell has an excellent reputation and it is important to maintain our client relationships during this transition.
 
What's Next
 
We know you may have questions about how you will be affected by the completion of this transaction. We have a team working through integration planning right now, and here are a few highlights from our plans:
 
                 
There will be no change to your role and / or reporting relationship unless you are otherwise notified.
 
 
                 
Ventas believes in pay-for-performance and market-based compensation and benefits programs.  Existing compensation and benefits programs will remain in effect while Ventas conducts an assessment of Cogdell's compensation and benefits programs as part of the integration process.
                 
Cogdell's employees at the properties are essential to the operation of the business going forward.  We will be focused on ensuring business continuity.
                 
Until the transaction is complete, Ventas and Cogdell will operate as separate companies.
                 
A Ventas-Cogdell team will develop a plan to facilitate an orderly separation of the Erdman business and continued support for the remaining Cogdell business.
 
We plan to meet in person in "Town Hall" fashion with you in early January to share our plans and vision of the future, present a preliminary integration timeline, and answer as many of your questions as possible.
 
As always, it is important for our Company to speak with one voice.
