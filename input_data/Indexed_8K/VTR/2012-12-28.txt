Effective December 21, 2012, Ventas, Inc. (the "Company") executed a transaction whereby the Company and the management team of Atria Senior Living, Inc. ("Atria") own 100% of Atria.  In the transaction, the Company acquired 100% of various private investment funds (the "Funds") previously managed by Lazard Frres Real Estate Investors LLC ("LFREI") or its affiliates.  The acquired Funds now own (i) a 34% interest in Atria and (ii) 3.7 million shares of the Company's common stock.  The purchase price for these interests was approximately $242 million.  The Company also extinguished its obligation related to the "earnout," a contingent performance-based payment arising out of the Company's 2011 acquisition of 117 Atria-managed senior living communities, for an additional $44 million.  This amount represented the discounted present value of the potential future payment, which was reflected on the Company's financial statements as a liability.
 
In the transaction, the Company obtained certain rights and minority protections regarding material transactions affecting Atria and is entitled to two seats on the Atria board of directors.  Atria remains the same corporate and licensed entity and will continue to manage for the Company a portfolio of 118 senior living communities.  The base management fee under the Company's management agreements with Atria will remain at 5% of revenues.
 
On December 24, 2012, the Company announced that it has closed during 2012, or expects to close by year end, investments totaling $2.7 billion, including $950 million in new investments during the fourth quarter.  The new investments include seniors housing communities, medical office buildings and debt origination, as well as the Atria transaction described above.

The Company does not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made.
The Company's actual future results and trends may differ materially from expectations depending on a variety of factors discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  These factors include without limitation: (a) the ability and willingness of the Company's tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other third parties to satisfy their obligations under their respective contractual arrangements with the Company, including, in some cases, their obligations to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities; (b) the ability of the Company's tenants, operators, borrowers and managers to maintain the financial strength and liquidity necessary to satisfy their respective obligations and liabilities to third parties, including without limitation obligations under their existing credit facilities and other indebtedness; (c) the Company's success in implementing its business strategy and the Company's ability to identify, underwrite, finance, consummate and integrate diversifying acquisitions and investments, including investments in different asset types and outside the United States; (d) macroeconomic conditions such as a disruption of or lack of access to the capital markets, changes in the debt rating on U.S. government securities, default or delay in payment by the United States of its obligations, and changes in the federal budget resulting in the reduction or nonpayment of Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement rates; (e) the nature and extent of future competition; (f) the extent of future or pending healthcare reform and regulation, including cost containment measures and changes in reimbursement policies, procedures and rates; (g) increases in the Company's borrowing costs as a result of changes in interest rates and other factors; (h) the ability of the Company's operators and managers, as applicable, to comply with laws, rules and regulations in the operation of the Company's properties, to deliver high quality services, to attract and retain qualified personnel and to attract residents and patients; (i) changes in general economic conditions or economic conditions in the markets in which the Company may, from time to time, compete, and the effect of those changes on the Company's revenues, earnings and funding sources; (j) the Company's ability to pay down, refinance, restructure or extend its indebtedness as it becomes due; (k) the Company's ability and willingness to maintain its qualification as a REIT in light of economic, market, legal, tax and other considerations; (l) final determination of the Company's taxable net income for the year ending December 31, 2012; (m) the ability and willingness of the Company's tenants to renew their leases with the Company upon expiration of the leases, the Company's ability to reposition its properties on the same or better terms in the event of nonrenewal or in the event the Company exercises its right to replace an existing tenant, and obligations, including indemnification obligations, the Company may incur in connection with the replacement of an existing tenant; (n) risks associated with the Company's senior living operating portfolio, such as factors that can cause volatility in the Company's operating income and earnings generated by those properties, including without limitation national and regional economic conditions, costs of food, materials, energy, labor and services, employee benefit costs, insurance costs and professional and general liability claims, and the timely delivery of accurate property-level financial results for those properties; (o) changes in U.S. and Canadian currency exchange rates; (p) year-over-year changes in the Consumer Price Index and the effect of those changes on the rent escalators contained in the Company's leases, including the rent escalator for Master Lease 2 with Kindred Healthcare, Inc., and the Company's earnings; (q) merger and acquisition activity in the healthcare industry resulting in a change of control of one or more of the Company's tenants, operators, borrowers or managers or significant changes in the senior management of the Company's tenants, operators, borrowers or managers; (r) the Company's ability and the ability of its tenants, operators, borrowers and managers to obtain and maintain
adequate property, liability and other insurance from reputable, financially stable providers; (s) the impact of increased operating costs and uninsured professional liability claims on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of the Company's tenants, operators, borrowers and managers, and the ability of the Company's tenants, operators, borrowers and managers to accurately estimate the magnitude of those claims; (t) risks associated with the Company's medical office building ("MOB") portfolio and operations, including its ability to successfully design, develop and manage MOBs, to accurately estimate its costs in fixed fee-for-service projects and to retain key personnel; (u) the ability of the hospitals on or near whose campuses the Company's MOBs are located and their affiliated health systems to remain competitive and financially viable and to attract physicians and physician groups; (v) the Company's ability to build, maintain and expand its relationships with existing and prospective hospital and health system clients; (w) risks associated with the Company's investments in joint ventures and unconsolidated entities, including its lack of sole decision-making authority and its reliance on its joint venture partners' financial condition; (x) the impact of market or issuer events on the liquidity or value of the Company's investments in marketable securities; and (y) the impact of litigation or any financial, accounting, legal or regulatory issues that may affect the Company or its tenants, operators, borrowers or managers.
