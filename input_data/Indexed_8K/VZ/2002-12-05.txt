Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure. Set forth below is a press release issued by Verizon Communications Inc. on December 5, 2002. NEWS RELEASE [VERIZON LOGO] FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE MEDIA CONTACT: DEC. 5, 2002 BOB VARETTONI 212-395-7726 robert.a.varettoni@verizon.com VERIZON ANNOUNCES PLAN TO EXPENSE STOCK OPTIONS AND DISCLOSES EFFECTS OF PENSION AND OTHER RETIREE BENEFIT COSTS NEW YORK - Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) announced today that it will expense the fair value of employee stock options granted on or after Jan. 1, 2003. The company also announced the expected amount of 2002 pension income, net of post-retirement benefit costs, and estimated the amount of income it expects to recognize in connection with these plans in 2003. Verizon's 2002 earnings per share (EPS) guidance of $3.05 to $3.09 remains unchanged. EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS The company estimates that, under current accounting rules, expensing stock options on a prospective basis will result in a charge to earnings of 2 cents per diluted share in 2003. "Today we informed our Board of Directors of our intention to expense employee stock options," said Verizon Chief Financial Officer Doreen Toben. "Options remain an important part
Verizon News Release, page 2 of our long-term incentive compensation program. Although we have always disclosed the effect of options in our annual reports and public filings, this is an issue of investor interest and we believe that now is the right time to begin including these costs in our results." PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT EFFECTS For 2002, the company expects to recognize non-cash pension income, net of post-retirement benefit costs, of approximately 35 cents per share. In 2003, the company anticipates that non-cash pension income, net of post-retirement benefit costs, will decline between 27 and 33 cents per share, resulting in net pension income of 2 to 8 cents per share in 2003. Toben said that current conditions in the securities markets will cause the company to lower its expected return on plan assets and discount rate assumption for 2003. This, coupled with rising medical and prescription drug costs that will increase the medical cost trend rate assumption, will result in the decrease in pension income in 2003. "From a cash perspective, we do not foresee a need to add funding to our pension plans overall in 2003," Toben said. "Our plans are currently adequately funded, and we expect that status to remain intact throughout 2003. Other post-retirement benefits, principally health care and life insurance obligations, are on a pay-as-you-go basis and will continue to be funded from our operating cash flow." SEIDENBERG: CONFIDENCE IN 2003 OUTLOOK Verizon Chief Executive Officer Ivan Seidenberg said, "As we look ahead to 2003, we will remain focused on operational execution and on further distinguishing ourselves from the other companies in the telecommunications sector. Just as we are performing very well in a difficult environment this year, we are confident in our ability to grow operationally in 2003.
