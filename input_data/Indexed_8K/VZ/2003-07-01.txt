Item 5. Other Events and Regulation FD Disclosure. Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon) announced it has changed its method for recognizing revenues and expenses in its directory business. In addition, resulting from its recent decision to sell its consolidated 39.4% interest in Grupo Iusacell S.A. de C.V. (Iusacell), Verizon announced it has reclassified this investment as a discontinued operation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." As required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the directory accounting change will be retroactive to January 1, 2003, and will result in an impact on first-quarter financial results. Current and prior-period financial information for Iusacell will be reported as a discontinued operation. Additional reconciliations now required under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation G pertaining to non-GAAP financial information included in Verizon's 2002 SEC Annual Report on Form 10-K are also provided herein. Directory Accounting Change The directory accounting change at Verizon's Information Services segment is from the publication-date method to the amortization method. The publication-date method recognizes revenues and direct expenses when directories are distributed. Under the amortization method, which is increasingly becoming the industry standard, revenues and direct expenses, primarily printing and distribution costs, are recognized over the life of the directory, which is usually 12 months. This accounting change affects the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses. It does not affect the timing of cash flows. A one-time non-cash charge of approximately $2.7 billion before taxes ($1.6 billion after-tax) was recorded, retroactive to January 1, 2003, for the cumulative effect of this accounting change. This directory accounting change increases first quarter 2003 revenues, operating expenses and net income of Verizon and its Information Services segment by $321 million, $89 million and $143 million (5 cents per diluted share), respectively. For comparison purposes only, if this accounting change had occurred in the first quarter of 2002, Verizon's and its Information Services segment's revenues, operating expenses and net income would have been higher by $226 million, $67 million and $98 million (4 cents per diluted share), respectively. Iusacell Sale The accounting for Iusacell is the result of Verizon's decision, announced June 13, 2003, to sell its 39.4% consolidated interest in Iusacell into a tender offer launched by Movil Access, a Mexican company. Verizon recorded a one-time charge of approximately $1.0 billion before taxes ($.9 billion after-tax) to write-off its interest in Iusacell during the second quarter. Iusacell's annual revenues ranged between $.5 billion to $.6 billion from 2000 through 2002. During that period, Iusacell reported net losses of less than $.1 billion (less than 1 cent to 3 cents per diluted share) in each year and cash from operating activities of $.1 billion or less each year. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, Iusacell's total assets were $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, and debt (non-recourse to Verizon) was $.8 billion in each period. Iusacell's revenues in the first quarter 2003 and 2002 were $.1 billion, net losses in each period were less than $15 million (less than 1 cent per diluted share) and cash from operating activities was $.1 billion or less in each period. As of March 31, 2003, Iusacell's total assets were $1.2 billion and debt (non-recourse to Verizon) was $.8 billion.
