Item 8.01. Other Events.
 
At the Goldman Sachs Communacopia XIII Conference on October 6, 2004, Ivan Seidenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Verizon Communications Inc., discussed the company's evaluation of its assets and properties for strategic fit and financial performance. Mr. Seidenberg noted that the company had suspended discussions recently with potential buyers related to its upstate New York access lines, pending an evaluation of its strategic options. However, he said that the company is continuing to consider plans for a reduction in the size of its access line business, including through a spin off mechanism or otherwise. He indicated that a reduction in the size of the access line business would enable the company to pursue its strategy to place greater focus on the high growth businesses of broadband and wireless. Mr. Seidenberg also stated that the company expects capital expenditures for 2004 to total slightly less than $13 billion, which is consistent with the company's prior guidance of $12 billion to $13 billion, and noted that, given wireless data and broadband expansion plans, capital expenditures for 2005 will likely increase slightly.
