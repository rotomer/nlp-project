Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
Attached as an exhibit hereto is a press release and financial tables dated October 28, 2004 issued by Verizon Communications Inc.
 
Non-GAAP Measures
 
Verizon's press release and financial tables include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.
 
The consolidated statements of income before special items eliminate special items and non-recurring items of revenues, expenses, gains and losses primarily as a result of their non-operational and/or non-recurring nature. Management believes this presentation of operating performance assists readers in better understanding our results of operations and trends from period to period, consistent with management's evaluation of Verizon's consolidated and segment results of operations for a variety of internal measures including strategic business planning, capital allocation and compensation. Management believes that the consolidated statements of income before special items provide current and prior period results of operations on a comparable basis as well as provide trends that are more indicative of future operating results than GAAP results of operations, given the non-operational and/or non-recurring nature of the special items removed for purposes of reporting results of operations before special items. While some of these items have been periodically reported in Verizon's consolidated results of operations, such as significant severance and impairment charges, their occurrence in future periods is dependent upon future business and economic factors, among other evaluation criteria, and may frequently be beyond the control of management. As a result of these factors, management also provides this information externally, along with a complete reconciliation to their comparable GAAP amounts so readers have access to the detail and general nature of adjustments made to GAAP results. Descriptions of the special items are provided in the schedules accompanying the news release.
 
Management believes that Verizon's operating income margins adjusted to exclude net pension and other postretirement (OPEB) expenses, Domestic Telecom's operating income margins and cash expenses excluding pension/OPEB and Verizon Wireless's operating income before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and EBITDA margin, additional non-GAAP financial measures, are also useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating financial performance. Operating income margins and cash expenses excluding net pension/OPEB expenses are non-GAAP operating performance measures used internally to evaluate current and prior operating expense efficiency, as well as assist management in evaluating the financial results of Verizon and its largest operating segment with and without a significant expense driver compared to prior periods. Management believes this presentation assists readers in better understanding the impact of this significant expense driver on our results of operations and trends from period to period. In addition, Verizon Wireless's EBITDA is determined by adding-back depreciation and amortization to operating income and the Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Verizon Wireless's EBITDA by Verizon Wireless's service revenues. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP operating performance measures that are used internally to evaluate current operating expense efficiency and operating profitability on a more variable cost basis by excluding the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions (particularly customer base amortization) that occurred in prior years. In addition, Verizon management uses this information to evaluate operating performance in relation to Verizon Wireless's competitors. The Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin utilizes service revenues rather than total revenues. Service revenues exclude primarily equipment revenues (as well as other non-service revenues) in order to capture the impact of providing service to the wireless customer base on an ongoing basis. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA margin is presented along with Verizon Wireless's operating income margin so as not to imply more emphasis should be placed on it than the corresponding GAAP measure. Management believes this presentation assists readers in preparing comparisons of this type of performance measure (operating profitability) using the GAAP measure as well as the measure segment management evaluates segment results and performs comparisons to other wireless carriers.
Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is also useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating liquidity and operating financial performance. Free cash flow is a financial measure that is commonly used by readers of financial information in assessing financial performance, including liquidity and the company's ability to meet obligations with available cash flows and cash balances. Management uses free cash flow information for allocating resources to debt repayment and for other cash investing and financing activities. The definition of free cash flow, cash from operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends paid to Verizon's shareowners, is readily determinable from amounts provided in Verizon's consolidated statements of cash flows.
 
It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance understanding of Verizon's GAAP consolidated financial statements and should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

Showing continued strong revenue growth, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) today reported third-quarter 2004 earnings of $1.8 billion  64 cents per diluted share, or 65 cents per share before one special item.
NEW YORK 
 
Quarterly consolidated operating revenues topped $18 billion for the first time in the company's history  increasing 6.7 percent to $18.2 billion, compared with $17.1 billion in the third quarter 2003.
 
Also for the first time, Verizon Wireless contributed more than 40 percent of Verizon's total revenues. The nation's leading wireless company grew revenues 23.0 percent to $7.3 billion, compared with $5.9 billion in the third quarter 2003.
 
This marks Verizon Wireless' ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit, year-over-year revenue increases, and the third consecutive quarter that increases totaled more than $1 billion compared with the previous year's quarter.
 
Overall, Verizon's growth businesses  wireless, long-distance, broadband, data and Enterprise services  accounted for 55 percent of third-quarter 2004 revenues. This compares with 49 percent of third-quarter 2003 revenues. Over the past year, revenues from these businesses have grown by 20.8 percent.
 
Domestic Telecom operating revenues were $9.6 billion in the third quarter 2004, a 2.1 percent decrease compared with the third quarter 2003 and a slight increase compared with the second quarter 2004. The segment's third-quarter results included an 8.7 percent increase in revenues from all long-distance services, which were $1.1 billion compared with $1.0 billion in the third quarter 2003, and an 11.5 percent increase in total data revenues, which were $2.0 billion compared with $1.8 billion in the third quarter 2003.
 
 
"Verizon has posted record revenues and another quarter of strong profitability. We are steadily building momentum and accelerating our transformation into an industry-leading wireless and broadband company," said Ivan Seidenberg, Verizon chairman and CEO. "Our wireless business has been a driver of overall revenue growth and a model of sustained excellence in terms of network quality, product innovation and customer satisfaction.
Verizon News Release, page 3
 
"As our business shifts from traditional narrow-band services and related markets, we are encouraged by the pace at which our overall revenue mix is evolving toward higher-growth services. We continue to see the benefits of cost controls and productivity improvements in our stable margins and cash flows, and we have the strongest balance sheet since our company was formed."
 
 
Verizon Wireless added 1.7 million net new customers, the largest quarterly customer increase in the history of the company, which was formed in April 2000. The total number of customers grew 16.9 percent year-over-year to 42.1 million, including 40.2 million retail customers.
 
As the company attracts new customers in record numbers, Verizon Wireless continues to produce industry-leading operational and profitability results. Average monthly churn, a key gauge of customer satisfaction, was 1.5 percent and continued to be the lowest in the industry among major carriers that have reported. Average monthly service revenue per customer increased 3.1 percent year-over-year to $51.58.
 
Wireless' operating income margin of 22.5 percent in the third quarter 2004 compares with 18.9 percent in the third quarter 2003. Quarterly operating income grew 46.4 percent year-over-year to $1.6 billion.
 
Wireless' EBITDA margin in the third quarter was 43.7 percent, the third consecutive quarter above 40 percent. (EBITDA  or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization  is a non-GAAP measure that adds depreciation and amortization to operating income; EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing EBITDA by Wireless' service revenues.)
 
 
On a consolidated basis, Verizon's operating income margin rose to 19.8 percent in the third quarter 2004, compared with 18.7 percent in the third quarter 2003. When adjusted to exclude the special and non-recurring items described later in this release as well as net pension and OPEB (other post-retirement benefit) impact, Verizon's consolidated operating income margin would have been 21.0 percent in the third quarter 2004 and 19.0 percent in the third quarter 2003 (non-GAAP measures).
Verizon News Release, page 4
 
Domestic Telecom's operating income margin was 14.7 percent in the third quarter 2004, compared with 16.3 percent in the third quarter 2003. When adjusted to exclude the items listed above, Domestic Telecom's operating income margin would have been 16.3 percent in the third quarter 2004 and 15.1 percent in the third quarter 2003 (non-GAAP measures).
 
Consistent with past practice, Verizon believes that excluding the impact of net pension and OPEB expenses or credits enhances comparability and provides a better picture of operating cost management.
 
 
Verizon added a net of 309,000 broadband DSL lines in the third quarter 2004 for a total of 3.3 million DSL lines in service, representing 1.1 million net additions over the past year. The company also began rolling out FiOS fiber-optic-based services in the third quarter 2004.
 
Revenues from DSL contributed to Verizon's total data revenues of $2.0 billion in the third quarter 2004. Data revenues represented 21 percent of Domestic Telecom's total operating revenues in the quarter, up from 18 percent in the third quarter 2003.
 
 
Cash flows from operating activities were $5.6 billion in the third quarter 2004, an increase of 5.5 percent compared with $5.3 billion in the third quarter 2003. Net cash used in investing activities was $3.1 billion, and net cash used in financing activities was $2.5 billion in the third quarter 2004.
 
Free cash flow was $1.3 billion for the third quarter of 2004, and $3.2 billion for the first nine months of the year. This compares with $1.4 billion for the third quarter of 2003, and $4.9 billion for the first nine months of 2003. Impacts on cash flow in 2004 have included severance payments associated with a 21,000-employee voluntary separation program, as well as increased capital investments compared with 2003 to fund broadband growth initiatives.
 
Total debt at the end of the third quarter 2004 was $40.5 billion, a reduction of 10.7 percent compared with $45.4 billion at year-end 2003.
Verizon News Release, page 5
 
 
Reported operating expenses increased 5.3 percent compared with the third quarter 2003, to $14.6 billion in the third quarter 2004.
 
When adjusted for special and non-recurring items, operating expenses were also $14.6 billion in the third quarter 2004, an increase of 6.1 percent from comparable expenses in the third quarter 2003 (non-GAAP measures). This increase was driven by the negative impact of $268 million related to pension and OPEB costs, and by costs associated with Verizon's growth businesses. Expenses for last year's third quarter included additional Domestic Telecom labor and weather-related repair costs, partially offset by non-operational expense benefits in other business units.
 
In Domestic Telecom, wage and salary expenses again decreased by more than $200 million year-over-year due to last year's voluntary separation program. These savings were used to fund increases in sales and marketing expenses and other operating costs in the growth areas of the wireline segment.
 
 
Reported earnings were 64 cents per share in both the third quarter 2004 and the third quarter 2003.
 
Before a $20 million (1 cent per share) special item related to pension settlements, third-quarter 2004 earnings were 65 cents per share. Third-quarter 2003 earnings were 67 cents per share before one special item of $81 million (3 cents per share), also related to pension settlements.
 
 
Following are third-quarter 2004 highlights from Verizon's four business segments.
