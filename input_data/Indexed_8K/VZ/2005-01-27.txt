Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
Attached as an exhibit hereto is a press release and financial tables dated January 27, 2005 issued by Verizon Communications Inc.
 
Non-GAAP Measures
 
Verizon's press release and financial tables include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.
 
The consolidated statements of income before special items eliminate special items and non-recurring items of revenues, expenses, gains and losses primarily as a result of their non-operational and/or non-recurring nature. Management believes this presentation of operating performance assists readers in better understanding our results of operations and trends from period to period, consistent with management's evaluation of Verizon's consolidated and segment results of operations for a variety of internal measures including strategic business planning, capital allocation and compensation. Management believes that the consolidated statements of income before special items provide current and prior period results of operations on a comparable basis as well as provide trends that are more indicative of future operating results than GAAP results of operations, given the non-operational and/or non-recurring nature of the special items removed for purposes of reporting results of operations before special items. While some of these items have been periodically reported in Verizon's consolidated results of operations, such as significant severance and impairment charges, their occurrence in future periods is dependent upon future business and economic factors, among other evaluation criteria, and may frequently be beyond the control of management. As a result of these factors, management also provides this information externally, along with a complete reconciliation to their comparable GAAP amounts so readers have access to the detail and general nature of adjustments made to GAAP results. Descriptions of the special items are provided in the schedules accompanying the news release.
 
Management believes that Verizon's operating income margins adjusted to exclude net pension and other postretirement (OPEB) expenses, Domestic Telecom's operating income margins and cash expenses excluding pension/OPEB and Verizon Wireless's operating income before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and EBITDA margin, additional non-GAAP financial measures, are also useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating financial performance. Operating income margins and cash expenses excluding net pension/OPEB expenses are non-GAAP operating performance measures used internally to evaluate current and prior operating expense efficiency, as well as assist management in evaluating the financial results of Verizon and its largest operating segment with and without a significant expense driver compared to prior periods. Management believes this presentation assists readers in better understanding the impact of this significant expense driver on our results of operations and trends from period to period. In addition, Verizon Wireless's EBITDA is determined by adding-back depreciation and amortization to operating income and the Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Verizon Wireless's EBITDA by Verizon Wireless's service revenues. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP operating performance measures that are used internally to evaluate current operating expense efficiency and operating profitability on a more variable cost basis by excluding the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions (particularly customer base amortization) that occurred in prior years. In addition, Verizon management uses this information to evaluate operating performance in relation to Verizon Wireless's competitors. The Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin utilizes service revenues rather than total revenues. Service revenues exclude primarily equipment revenues (as well as other non-service revenues) in order to capture the impact of providing service to the wireless customer base on an ongoing basis. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA margin is presented along with Verizon Wireless's operating income margin so as not to imply more emphasis should be placed on it than the corresponding GAAP measure. Management believes this presentation assists readers in preparing comparisons of this type of performance measure (operating profitability) using the GAAP measure as well as the measure segment management evaluates segment results and performs comparisons to other wireless carriers.
Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is also useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating liquidity and operating financial performance. Free cash flow is a financial measure that is commonly used by readers of financial information in assessing financial performance, including liquidity and the company's ability to meet obligations with available cash flows and cash balances. Management uses free cash flow information for allocating resources to debt repayment and for other cash investing and financing activities. The definition of free cash flow, cash from operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends paid to Verizon's shareowners, is readily determinable from amounts provided in Verizon's consolidated statements of cash flows.
 
It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance understanding of Verizon's GAAP consolidated financial statements and should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

Notes: See the schedules accompanying this news release and www.verizon.com/investor for reconciliations to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the non-GAAP financial measures included in this announcement. Discontinued operations in the quarterly periods presented include the operations of Verizon Information Services Canada, following a third-quarter 2004 agreement to sell this business. Fourth quarter and year-to-date 2004 also include the gain on the sale.
 
Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) today reported strong fourth-quarter and year-end 2004 results as quarterly revenues increased 6.2 percent, driven by a 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit, year-over-year revenue increases for wireless services. Wireless contributed $27.7 billion to the corporation's $71.3 billion total revenues in 2004.
NEW YORK 
 
For the fourth quarter 2004, Verizon reported earnings of $3.0 billion, or $1.08 per diluted share, compared with a loss of $1.5 billion, or 53 cents per share, in the fourth quarter 2003. Reported earnings in the fourth quarter 2004 included non-recurring gains from sales of non-strategic assets and tax benefits, while the fourth quarter 2003 loss included non-recurring expenses from a voluntary separation plan and environmental remediation costs.
 
Before special items, earnings were 64 cents per share in the fourth quarter 2004 and 58 cents per share in the fourth quarter 2003.
 
For the year, Verizon reported earnings of $7.8 billion, or $2.79 per share, compared with $3.1 billion, or $1.12 per share, in 2003. Before special items, earnings were $7.0 billion ($2.51 per share) in 2004, and $7.3 billion ($2.60 per share) in 2003.
 
Quarterly consolidated operating revenues reached a company-record $18.3 billion in the fourth quarter 2004, increasing 6.2 percent compared with $17.2 billion in the fourth quarter 2003. Annual consolidated operating revenues were $71.3 billion in 2004, increasing 5.7 percent compared with $67.5 billion in 2003  Verizon's strongest annual revenue growth in three years.
 
Verizon Wireless contributed more than 40 percent of Verizon's total revenues in the fourth quarter 2004, compared with less than 35 percent in the fourth quarter 2003. Wireless

revenues were $7.3 billion in the fourth quarter 2004, a 22.7 percent increase compared with $6.0 billion in the fourth quarter 2003. Full-year 2004 wireless revenues were $27.7 billion, an increase of $5.2 billion, or 23.0 percent, compared with 2003.
 
Overall, Verizon's growth businesses  wireless, long-distance, broadband, data and Enterprise services  accounted for 55.2 percent of fourth-quarter 2004 revenues, compared with 49.3 percent of fourth-quarter 2003 revenues. Over the past year, revenues from these businesses have grown by 19.0 percent.
 
Operating revenues for Domestic Telecom, the company's U.S. wireline business segment, were $9.7 billion in the fourth quarter 2004, a 2.4 percent decrease compared with the fourth quarter 2003. For the year, wireline operating revenues were $38.6 billion, a 2.7 percent decrease compared with 2003.
 
 
"Building on our excellent fourth-quarter and full-year results, our business fundamentals as we enter 2005 are the strongest they've been in years," said Ivan Seidenberg, Verizon chairman and CEO.
 
"In 2004, we changed our growth profile by divesting non-strategic assets, by extending our industry leadership in wireless, and by gaining momentum in broadband, long-distance and Enterprise markets. Our wireline business has maintained stable margins, and Verizon Information Services and International have continued to contribute significant revenue, income and cash flow. As we move forward, we are realizing value from our diversified asset base, and we are investing in growth areas as we build tomorrow's networks to provide customers with continuous service enhancements and product innovations."
 
 
Verizon Wireless added 1.7 million net new customers, the largest quarterly customer increase in the history of the company, which was formed in April 2000. For the year, Verizon Wireless added 6.3 million net new customers, as its total number of customers grew 16.8 percent year-over-year to 43.8 million, including 41.8 million retail customers.
 
Total churn reached record-low levels for the quarter and the year. Total churn was 1.43 percent for the fourth quarter and 1.50 percent for the year. Churn among retail post-pay customers  or 92 percent of the company's customers  was 1.2 percent for the quarter and 1.3 percent for the year.

On a consolidated basis, Verizon's operating income margin was 18.4 percent in the fourth quarter 2004, compared with negative margins due to the reported loss in the fourth quarter 2003. When adjusted to exclude the special and non-recurring items described later in this release as well as net pension and OPEB (other post-retirement benefit) impact, Verizon's consolidated operating income margin would have been 20.3 percent in the fourth quarter 2004 and 18.3 percent in the fourth quarter 2003 (non-GAAP measures).
 
Operating income margin for the wireline segment was 15.2 percent in the fourth quarter 2004, compared with 15.4 percent in the fourth quarter 2003. When adjusted to exclude the items listed above, wireline's operating income margin would have been 17.3 percent in the fourth quarter 2004 and 15.4 percent in the fourth quarter 2003 (non-GAAP measures).
 
Consistent with past practice, Verizon believes that excluding the impact of special and non-recurring items and net pension and OPEB expenses or credits enhances comparability, providing a better picture of operating cost management.
 
Verizon Wireless' operating income margin was 18.7 percent in the fourth quarter 2004, compared with 18.5 percent in the fourth quarter 2003, and a record 21.1 percent for full-year 2004, compared with 18.2 percent for 2003.
 
Wireless' EBITDA margin was 39.5 percent in the fourth quarter 2004, compared with 39.7 percent in the fourth quarter 2003. (EBITDA  or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization  is a non-GAAP measure that adds depreciation and amortization to operating income; EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing EBITDA by Wireless' service revenues.) Fourth-quarter 2004 EBITDA margin was impacted by expenses attributable to Verizon Wireless' long-term employee incentive plan, which have increased as the value of Verizon Wireless has increased.
 
Verizon Wireless' 2004 EBITDA margin of 42.3 percent was its highest-ever margin for a full year.

Verizon added a net of 306,000 broadband DSL lines in the fourth quarter 2004 for a total of 3.6 million DSL lines in service, representing 1.2 million net additions over the past year  a growth rate of 53.5 percent.
 
Revenues from DSL contributed to total wireline data revenues of $2.0 billion in the fourth quarter 2004, a 9.2 percent increase compared with $1.9 billion in data revenues in the fourth quarter 2003. For the year, data revenues of $7.8 billion grew 7.4 percent compared with 2003 and now represent more than 20 percent of total wireline revenues.
 
Even as strong DSL customer and revenue growth continue, Verizon has begun deploying FiOS next-generation, fiber-optic-based broadband services. FiOS services currently have more than 20 percent market penetration in Keller, Texas, Verizon's first market, after the first four and a half months of sales.
 
In another wireline growth area, revenues from long-distance services, including regional toll services, were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter 2004, a 5.8 percent increase compared with $1.0 billion in the fourth quarter 2003. On an annual basis, these revenues totaled $4.2 billion in 2004, a 10.4 percent increase compared with 2003.
 
 
Verizon's total debt decreased $6.1 billion last year, to $39.3 billion at year-end 2004 from $45.4 billion at year-end 2003  reaching a previously announced target of debt levels in relation to corporate earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
 
CFFO was $21.8 billion in 2004, compared with $22.5 billion in 2003. The change is primarily due to 2004 severance payments related to the 21,000-employee voluntary separation plan in the fourth quarter 2003, offset by strong cash flow. In 2004, net cash used in investing activities was $10.3 billion, and net cash used in financing activities was $9.9 billion.
 
On a segment level, wireline's CFFO was $11.8 billion in 2004, compared with $12.3 billion in 2003. Verizon Wireless' CFFO was $9.5 billion in 2004, compared with $7.5 billion in 2003.
 
Free cash flow (non-GAAP, cash from operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends) was $4.3 billion in 2004, compared with $6.4 billion in 2003. Impacts on cash flow in 2004 included severance payments associated with the voluntary separation plan, as well as increased capital investments compared with 2003 to fund wireless and fiber-optic broadband growth initiatives.
Verizon News Release, page 6
 
Capital expenditures in 2004 totaled $13.3 billion, compared with $11.9 billion in 2003. In 2005, overall capital spending is expected to increase approximately 10 percent over 2004, driven by focused investments in growth markets.
 
 
In the fourth quarter 2004, reported operating expenses decreased 23.0 percent compared with the fourth quarter 2003, to $14.9 billion. When adjusted for special and non-recurring items, operating expenses were $14.8 billion in the fourth quarter 2004, an increase of 5.1 percent from comparable expenses in the fourth quarter 2003 (non-GAAP measure). Expenses for the fourth quarter 2003 included special items associated with the voluntary separation plan, environmental remediation costs and leasing operations costs, partially offset by net gains on sales of investments.
 
 
Verizon's reported fourth-quarter 2004 earnings of $3.0 billion, or $1.08 per share, principally included these special items: net gains of $1.0 billion, or 36 cents per share, from the sales of Verizon Information Services Canada and Verizon's investment stake in TELUS Corp.; and tax benefits of $0.2 billion, or 8 cents per share, from previous investment-related losses. Verizon's reported year-end 2004 earnings of $7.8 billion, or $2.79 per share, also included $0.5 billion, or 18 cents per share, in previously reported severance-related charges, partially offset by a $43 million, or 2 cents per share, gain on the sale of an investment.
 
Verizon's reported year-end 2003 earnings of $3.1 billion, or $1.12 per share, included net charges of $4.2 billion. These net charges included gains of $0.5 billion related to accounting changes and to the net proceeds from sales of investments. These gains were more than offset by charges, including $3.4 billion related to severance, pension and benefit costs; $0.9 billion related to Verizon's decision to sell its interest in Grupo Iusacell, a Mexican wireless business; and $0.4 billion related to environmental remediation, leasing operations and other charges.
Verizon News Release, page 7
 
Earnings per share calculations in all periods are impacted by a recent accounting change that increases the net income and number of shares in the diluted earnings per share calculations. This accounting change decreased 2004 diluted earnings per share by 1 cent and 2003 diluted earnings per share by 2 cents.
