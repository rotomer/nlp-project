Item 8.01 Other Events.
 
Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon) reported in its Form 10-Q filing for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2004 that, effective January 1, 2005, Verizon would begin evaluating its wireless licenses for potential impairment using a direct value methodology, rather than the residual method, which had been used prior to January 1, 2005. Verizon initiated this change in accordance with a Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Announcement, "Use of the Residual Method to Value Acquired Assets Other Than Goodwill." The valuation and analyses prepared in connection with the adoption of a direct value method effective January 1, 2005 resulted in no adjustment to the carrying value of Verizon's wireless licenses, and accordingly, had no effect on our results of operations and financial position.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
