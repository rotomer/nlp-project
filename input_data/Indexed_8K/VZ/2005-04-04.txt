Exhibit 99
 
 
 
 
NEW YORK 
The following letter from Verizon (NYSE:VZ) to MCI, Inc. (NASDAQ:MCIP) describes some of the issues that Verizon believes the MCI Board of Directors might appropriately consider as it assesses Qwest's offer in light of the signed agreement with Verizon. Verizon believes that the decision facing MCI is not about the math of a particular moment in time; it is about good business judgment, the best interests of shareowners and the long-term viability of the new company.
 
Based on these criteria, Qwest has submitted what we believe to be an inferior offer. If the MCI Board, capitulating to Qwest's artificial deadline, declares this bid to be "superior," it would seem to us that the decision-making process is being driven by the interests of short-term investors rather than the company's long-term strength and viability. Should this occur, we would no longer be interested in participating in such a process.

Gentlemen:
 
On April 1, 2005, Qwest accused your Board of Directors of demonstrating "favoritism" and of "tilt[ing] the regulatory playing fieldin a dubious example of corporate governance." Although we believe the true facts will be revealed in due course, we nevertheless feel compelled to write to set the record straight.
 
We observe that MCI's Board appears to have devoted an extraordinary amount of time and energy to both understanding the industrial dynamics confronting MCI and evaluating alternatives available to it. We believe the decision to join with Verizon represents the most sensible course for MCI and its stakeholders. Moreover, we believe this decision is supported by a realistic and dispassionate assessment of the challenging industry environment we see confronting the company and the industry including:

We believe MCI's Board has correctly recognized that the company's stakeholdersparticularly its shareholderswill be subjected to these market forces whether the company remains independent or completes a transaction with either Verizon or Qwest. Moreover, we believe this Boardperhaps better than mostshould recognize that a company that fails to adequately address the forces at work in the telecom services marketplace is destined to repeat past calamities and suffer grief such as befell both WorldCom and Qwest.
 
Verizon has carefully built its business to be able to deliver a broad range of communications products and services while prudently managing its operations and finances. Verizon is well positioned to achieve growth while withstanding the financial and operational risks of the current environment. We believe a stakeholderand particularly a shareholderof Verizon/MCI would not need to be concerned about the financial viability of the company (as we believe would be the case if MCI combines with Qwest). In fact, shareholders of Verizon receive substantial dividends every quarter demonstrating the benefits of our balanced business model.
 
Not only would Verizon's financial position protect the new company from the inevitable operational and financial challenges as new business models emerge, but it would also allow Verizon/MCI to invest the substantial sums required to pursue exciting new opportunities in IP and wireless products and services.

Together, Verizon and MCI would form a leading global competitor with financial strength, an extensive U.S. and European presence, and industry leading capabilities in IP-based and wireless products and services. We believe a combined Verizon/MCI would be far better equipped to compete in the challenging industrial environment than a combined Qwest/MCI. Indeed, as we have written to you previously, we believe that instead of being an industry leader, a combined Qwest/MCI may not even form a viable competitor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Verizon's plan for MCI is clear and straight forwardVerizon intends to invest in MCI now and in the future so that MCI not only survives but prospers to become an even more formidable competitor. Verizon intends to use its local presence and industry leading national wireless capabilities to deliver world class products and services to MCI's customers. Verizon intends to provide MCI's suppliers and employees the comfort that MCI is financially secure and positioned for growth. Put simply, Verizon is seeking to acquire MCI to bolster its competitive positionnot to raid its balance sheet and use it as a financial life boat as we believe is the case with Qwest.

We believe the headline numbers in the Qwest proposal mask a myriad of financial and operational risks. We also believe MCI's Board understands that a proper comparative analysis is less about succumbing to the math of the moment and more about common sense and good business judgment. We observe that Qwest's artificial deadlines and attacks on your integrity, process and judgment may appeal to a vocal minority of MCI's shareholders; however, we believe they should not be permitted to stampede the Board into a rushed decision that has no meaning in the context of the thorough and disciplined process it has pursued.
 
The transaction to which Verizon and MCI have agreed provides:
 
 
 
 
 
We look forward to the opportunity to discuss our views more directly with your shareholders in the near future once you have completed the filing of required proxy materials.
 
Sincerely,
