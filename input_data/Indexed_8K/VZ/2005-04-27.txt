Attached as an exhibit hereto is a press release and financial tables dated April 27, 2005 issued by Verizon Communications Inc.
 
 
Non-GAAP Measures
 
Verizon's press release and financial tables include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.
 
The consolidated statements of income before special items eliminate special items and non-recurring items of revenues, expenses, gains and losses primarily as a result of their non-operational and/or non-recurring nature. Management believes this presentation of operating performance assists readers in better understanding our results of operations and trends from period to period, consistent with management's evaluation of Verizon's consolidated and segment results of operations for a variety of internal measures including strategic business planning, capital allocation and compensation. Management believes that the consolidated statements of income before special items provide current and prior period results of operations on a comparable basis as well as provide trends that are more indicative of future operating results than GAAP results of operations, given the non-operational and/or non-recurring nature of the special items removed for purposes of reporting results of operations before special items. While some of these items have been periodically reported in Verizon's consolidated results of operations, such as significant severance and impairment charges, their occurrence in future periods is dependent upon future business and economic factors, among other evaluation criteria, and may frequently be beyond the control of management. As a result of these factors, management also provides this information externally, along with a complete reconciliation to their comparable GAAP amounts so readers have access to the detail and general nature of adjustments made to GAAP results. Descriptions of the special items are provided in the schedules accompanying the news release.
 
Management believes that Domestic Telecom's cash expenses excluding net pension and other postretirement (OPEB) expenses, a non-GAAP financial measure, is also useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating financial performance. Cash expenses excluding net pension/OPEB expenses is a non-GAAP operating performance measure used internally to evaluate current and prior operating expense efficiency, as well as assist management in evaluating the financial results of Verizon and its largest operating segment with and without a significant expense driver compared to prior periods. Management believes this presentation assists readers in better understanding the impact of this significant expense driver on our results of operations and trends from period to period.
 
It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance understanding of Verizon's GAAP consolidated financial statements and should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

Verizon News Release, page 2
 
Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) today reported first-quarter 2005 earnings of $1.8 billion, or 63 cents per diluted share, as quarterly revenues increased 6.6 percent, driven by the fifth consecutive quarter of more than 20 percent total revenue growth year-over-year at Verizon Wireless.
NEW YORK 
 
The $1.8 billion in reported first-quarter 2005 earnings compares with $1.2 billion, or 43 cents per share, in the first quarter 2004. Verizon's 63 cents per share in first-quarter 2005 earnings increased 8.6 percent compared with 58 cents per share in the first quarter 2004, when 2004 results are adjusted for special items, primarily for pension settlements associated with a voluntary separation plan (non-GAAP measure). No special items or adjustments are included in first-quarter 2005 results.
 
Consolidated revenues of $18.2 billion in the first quarter 2005 increased 6.6 percent, or $1.1 billion, compared with the first quarter 2004.
 
Verizon Wireless contributed $7.4 billion, or 40.8 percent, of first-quarter 2005 consolidated revenues. This compares with wireless revenues of $6.2 billion, or 36.1 percent of consolidated revenues, in the first quarter 2004. Total wireless revenues have increased by more than 10 percent year-over-year for 11 consecutive quarters, including the 20 percent-plus year-over-year increases for the past five quarters.
 
Operating revenues for Domestic Telecom, the company's U.S. wireline business segment, were $9.5 billion in the first quarter 2005, a 1.2 percent decrease compared with $9.6 billion in the first quarter 2004. This is the segment's lowest rate of revenue decline in nearly four years.
 
 
"This is not only a great start to 2005, it's also an improvement on key industry-leading results that Verizon has delivered over the past year," said Ivan Seidenberg, Verizon chairman and CEO. "Our significant network investments have given us a technology platform to successfully compete for customers in changing and growing markets, as evidenced by our unrivaled results in wireless. Even as we continue to transform our business, we are driving revenue growth and sustaining high-performance operating metrics and financial results.

"In an outstanding first quarter, Verizon Wireless launched exciting new broadband services and improved on its industry-leading customer loyalty, while wireline produced strong revenue growth in the broadband, long-distance and data markets. Our margins continue to be stable as we continue to make strategic capital investments in growth markets."
 
 
Verizon Wireless added 1.64 million net new customers, the largest first-quarter customer increase in the history of the company. Wireless has added more than 6.5 million net new customers over the past year and now has a total of 45.5 million customers nationwide.
 
Customer turnover reached record-low levels for the second consecutive quarter. The total churn rate, a key measure of customer loyalty, was 1.33 percent for the first quarter 2005, down from 1.60 percent in the first quarter 2004 and 1.43 percent in the fourth quarter 2004. Churn among retail post-pay customers  representing 92 percent of the company's customer base  was a record 1.11 percent for the first quarter 2005, compared with 1.35 percent for the first quarter 2004.
 
 
Verizon added a net of 385,000 wireline broadband connections in the first quarter 2005 for a total of 3.9 million broadband connections  a growth rate of 48 percent compared with first quarter 2004. Wireline broadband connections include both DSL lines and new FiOS next-generation, fiber-optic-based services. DSL net additions in the first quarter 2005 were the highest quarterly total in Verizon's history, representing the vast majority of the 385,000 total.
 
Revenues from wireline broadband services contributed to total wireline data revenues of $2.1 billion in the first quarter 2005, an 11.6 percent increase compared with $1.9 billion in the first quarter 2004.
 
Revenues from wireline long-distance services, including regional toll services, were $1.1 billion in the first quarter 2005, an 8.3 percent increase compared with $1.0 billion in the first quarter 2004. The number of Verizon long-distance lines in service rose to more than 18 million, an 11.6 percent increase compared with the first quarter 2004.

In the first quarter 2005, operating expenses increased 1.4 percent to $14.8 billion, compared with first-quarter 2004 operating expenses of $14.6 billion. On a comparable basis, first-quarter 2005 expenses increased 6.7 percent over first-quarter 2004 expenses adjusted to exclude the non-recurring pension settlements noted earlier (non-GAAP measure).
 
Verizon's total debt at the end of the first quarter 2005 declined to $39.2 billion, compared with $39.3 billion at year-end 2004 and $44.5 billion at the end of the first quarter 2004.
 
Cash Flows From Operating Activities (CFFO) were $3.9 billion in the first quarter 2005, compared with $4.0 billion in the first quarter 2004. There were significant non-recurring cash outflows in both periods, including pension contributions and taxes on prior-year investment sales in the first quarter 2005 and severance payments in the first quarter 2004.
 
In the first quarter 2005, net cash used in investing activities was $4.3 billion, and net cash used in financing activities was $1.2 billion. Included in first-quarter 2005 investing activities were $3.6 billion in capital expenditures, which were $953 million higher than in the first quarter 2004 due to increased infrastructure investments to support broadband wireline and wireless growth and operational efficiency initiatives.
 
On a segment level, Domestic Telecom's CFFO was $2.0 billion in the first quarter 2005, a 1.0 percent decrease compared with the first quarter 2004. Wireless CFFO was $3.0 billion in the first quarter 2005, a 32.4 percent increase compared with the first quarter 2004.
