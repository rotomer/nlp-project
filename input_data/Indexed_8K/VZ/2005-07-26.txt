Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
Attached as an exhibit hereto is a press release and financial tables dated July 26, 2005 issued by Verizon Communications Inc.
 
Non-GAAP Measures
 
Verizon's press release and financial tables include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.
 
The consolidated statements of income before special items eliminate special items and non-recurring items of revenues, expenses, gains and losses primarily as a result of their non-operational and/or non-recurring nature. This also includes current and prior periods' operating revenues and operating expenses of significant operations sold, including Verizon's Hawaii wireline and directory operations which were sold during the second quarter of 2005. Management believes this presentation of operating performance assists readers in better understanding our results of operations and trends from period to period, consistent with management's evaluation of Verizon's consolidated and segment results of operations for a variety of internal measures including strategic business planning, capital allocation and compensation. Management believes that the consolidated statements of income before special items provide current and prior period results of operations on a comparable basis as well as provide trends that are more indicative of future operating results than GAAP results of operations, given the non-operational and/or non-recurring nature of the special items removed for purposes of reporting results of operations before special items. While some of these items have been periodically reported in Verizon's consolidated results of operations, such as significant severance and impairment charges, their occurrence in future periods is dependent upon future business and economic factors, among other evaluation criteria, and may frequently be beyond the control of management. As a result of these factors, management also provides this information externally, along with a complete reconciliation to their comparable GAAP amounts so readers have access to the detail and general nature of adjustments made to GAAP results. Descriptions of the special items are provided in the schedules accompanying the news release.
 
Management believes that Verizon Wireless's operating income before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and EBITDA margin, additional non-GAAP financial measures, are also useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating Verizon Wireless's operating financial performance. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA is determined by adding-back depreciation and amortization to operating income and the Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Verizon Wireless's EBITDA by Verizon Wireless's service revenues. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP operating performance measures that are used internally to evaluate current operating expense efficiency and operating profitability on a more variable cost basis by excluding the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions (particularly customer base amortization) that occurred in prior years. In addition, Verizon management uses this information to evaluate operating performance in relation to Verizon Wireless's competitors. The Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin utilizes service revenues rather than total revenues. Service revenues exclude primarily equipment revenues (as well as other non-service revenues) in order to capture the impact of providing service to the wireless customer base on an ongoing basis. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA margin is presented along with Verizon Wireless's operating income margin so as not to imply more emphasis should be placed on it than the corresponding GAAP measure. Management believes this presentation assists readers in preparing comparisons of this type of performance measure (operating profitability) using the GAAP measure as well as the measure segment management evaluates segment results and performs comparisons to other wireless carriers.
 
It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance understanding of Verizon's GAAP consolidated financial statements and should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

Notes: Reclassifications of prior-period amounts have been made to reflect comparable results excluding Verizon's Hawaii wireline and directory operations, which were sold in the second quarter 2005. Growth percentages cited above compare second quarter 2005 with second quarter 2004. See the schedules accompanying this news release and www.verizon.com/investor for reconciliations to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the non-GAAP financial measures included in this announcement. Discontinued operations in the prior-year periods presented include the operations of Verizon Information Services Canada.
 
Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) today reported second-quarter 2005 earnings of $2.1 billion, or 75 cents per diluted share, highlighted by another record-breaking quarter at Verizon Wireless and continued strong consolidated cash flows and revenue growth.
NEW YORK 
 
Second-quarter earnings included $336 million, or 12 cents per share, from the sale of wireline and directory operations in Hawaii, as well as tax benefits of $242 million recognized on prior-year investment losses, partially offset by net tax expense of $232 million for the repatriation of foreign earnings. Earnings before these special items (non-GAAP measure) were $1.8 billion, or 63 cents per share. This compares with $1.8 billion, or 64 cents per share, in earnings before special items in the second quarter 2004.
 
The tax on repatriated foreign earnings relates primarily to the more than $2 billion that Verizon expects to receive in 2005 from share buybacks initiated by Italian wireless provider Vodafone Omnitel. Verizon received $1.2 billion in proceeds in the second quarter 2005 and anticipates receiving the final amount in the second half of 2005.
 
 
Consolidated operating revenues of $18.6 billion in the second quarter 2005 set a company record, increasing 4.6 percent compared with the second quarter 2004. Consolidated operating revenues on a comparable basis (non-GAAP measure, excluding revenues from Verizon's Hawaii operations in both periods) were $18.5 billion in the second quarter 2005. This is an increase of 5.1 percent, or $0.9 billion, compared with the second quarter 2004.
 
Second-quarter total revenues at Verizon Wireless increased 14.6 percent, or $1.0 billion, to $7.8 billion when compared with the second quarter 2004, marking the 12th consecutive quarter of more than 10 percent year-over-year increases.
Verizon News Release, page 3
 
Operating revenues on a comparable basis at Domestic Telecom were $9.4 billion in the second quarter 2005. This 0.5 percent decrease, compared with the second quarter 2004, was the segment's lowest rate of revenue decline in four years. Domestic Telecom revenues in the second quarter 2005 increased $78 million over the first quarter 2005 on a comparable basis.
 
In the second quarter 2005, consolidated operating expenses increased 3.0 percent to $14.5 billion, compared with second-quarter 2004 operating expenses of $14.1 billion.
 
 
"These are strong first-half results, with contributions from all segments of our diverse revenue base," said Ivan Seidenberg, Verizon chairman and chief executive officer. "Wireless in particular remains in high gear. Because of the healthy margins in our wireless business, we are able to take the steps to increase our market share, which we did effectively this quarter. We continue to make the technology and infrastructure investments that allow us to unleash the full potential of the best wireless network in the country. As is evident by our market-share gains and our industry-leading customer-loyalty results, customers are responding.
 
"This same winning formula of putting customers first and building profitable growth on a foundation of investment and innovation is also evident in wireline, where we continue to see steady improvement in revenue trends. Customers  whether they choose wireless, wireline or both  are seeing the value of our superior, next-generation broadband services."
 
 
Verizon Wireless added 1.9 million net new customers. Excluding acquisitions, this is the largest quarterly customer increase in the history of the wireless industry. Wireless has added 6.9 million net new customers over the past 12 months and now has a total of 47.4 million customers nationwide.
 
Customer turnover reached record-low levels for the third consecutive quarter. The total churn rate, a key measure of customer loyalty, was 1.2 percent for the second quarter 2005, down from 1.4 percent in the second quarter 2004. Churn in the retail post-paid segment  a base of 44 million customers  was 1.0 percent in the second quarter 2005.
 
Strict cost-management contributed to strong operating income margin of 22.7 percent in the second quarter 2005. This was the second-highest margin in the company's history, driven
Verizon News Release, page 4
 
by industry-leading lows for cash expense-per-customer, even as the company added an extraordinary volume of customers in the quarter. EBITDA margin at Verizon Wireless was 43.0 percent in the quarter. (EBITDA  or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization  is a non-GAAP measure that adds depreciation and amortization to operating income; EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing EBITDA by wireless service revenues.)
 
 
In wireline, quarterly operating revenues were supported by 0.7 percent year-over-year revenue growth in the consumer business, reversing a trend that had been negative since the company began reporting wireline revenue by line of business in 2002. The consumer business generated $3.8 billion in second-quarter 2005 revenues, driven by continued solid growth from sales of broadband and long-distance services.
 
Revenues from wireline broadband services contributed to $2.1 billion in total data revenues in the second quarter 2005, a 10.9 percent increase from $1.9 billion in comparable revenues in the second quarter 2004.
 
Revenues from wireline long-distance services, including regional toll services, were $1.1 billion in the second quarter 2005, a 6.7 percent increase from $1.0 billion in comparable revenues in the second quarter 2004. Long-distance lines totaled 18.0 million at the end of the second quarter 2005, an 8.8 percent increase from a comparable total of 16.5 million lines at the end of the second quarter 2004.
 
In the second quarter 2005, Verizon added a net of 278,000 wireline broadband connections, which represents the total number of DSL and Fios lines put in service. Fios is Verizon's recently introduced next-generation, fiber-optic-based service. Verizon has a total of 4.1 million wireline broadband connections  a growth rate of 43.7 percent from the second quarter 2004 on a comparable basis.
 
 
Cash Flows From Operating Activities (CFFO) were $9.9 billion in the first six months of 2005, a slight increase compared with the first six months of 2004.
 
In the first six months of 2005, net cash used in investing activities was $10.9 billion, and net cash provided by financing activities was $125 million. Investing activities included $7.7 billion in capital expenditures, predominantly focused on growth markets.
Verizon News Release, page 5
 
Verizon anticipates that 2005 capital spending will increase approximately 15 percent over 2004 expenditures of $13.3 billion. This revises its previous guidance of an increase of approximately 10 percent. The increase is attributable to the strong growth at Verizon Wireless and increased spending for the deployment of Fios video services.
 
Verizon's total debt at the end of the second quarter 2005 was $41.8 billion, compared with $41.9 billion at the end of the second quarter 2004. Short-term debt in the second quarter 2005 increased as a result of Verizon's investing activities, including the NextWave Telecom wireless spectrum purchase.
 
 
As noted above, reported earnings were 75 cents per share in the second quarter 2005 and 64 cents per share in the second quarter 2004.
 
Second-quarter 2005 earnings were 63 cents per share before the gain on the sale of Verizon's Hawaii wireline and directory operations, and net tax benefits. These net tax benefits include $242 million related to prior-year investment losses that became recognizable as a result of capital gains on the Hawaii operations sale, net of tax expense of $232 million related to the repatriation of prior-year foreign earnings.
 
Second-quarter 2004 earnings were 64 cents per share as charges of 4 cents per share related to operating asset losses, pension settlements and the early retirement of debt offset an expense credit of 4 cents per share resulting from the favorable resolution of pre-bankruptcy amounts due from MCI.
 
 
Following are second-quarter 2005 highlights from Verizon's four business segments.
