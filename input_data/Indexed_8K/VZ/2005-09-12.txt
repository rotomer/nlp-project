A merger with Verizon is a highly compelling value proposition for MCI shareholders
Significant premium to stand-alone valuation of MCI
Pricing mechanism provides protection against a decline in Verizon's stock price with upside participation through continuing interest in Verizon equity
Immediate cash return via special dividend by MCI
Verizon stock consideration offers ownership in a strong integrated carrier with above average dividend yield and that is positioned for growth
2
 
Summary of key transaction terms1
Stock and cash consideration valued at $26.00 per MCI share, prior to any adjustments:
Up to $5.60 in cash paid by MCI after shareholder approval2
20.40 in stock plus any amount of cash dividend not previously paid by MCI, paid on closing
Minimum value of $26.00 per MCI share3 (before any downward adjustment for liabilities) with upside if Verizon's stock price is above $35.52
Mix of stock and cash may change if Verizon's stock price is below $35.52
Potential downward purchase price adjustment based on amount of MCI's remaining bankruptcy and tax-related liabilities in excess of $1.775 billion, if any, at closing; under the purchase price adjustment mechanism, full amount of merger consideration at risk. MCI currently estimates range of adjustment at $0.00-$0.21 per MCI share.
1 See Proxy Statement and Merger Agreement for a more complete description of the terms.
2 If MCI pays less than the $5.60 dividend, the remainder, net of any purchase price adjustment, will be paid out by Verizon as cash merger consideration, without interest, at closing.
3 If Verizon's average stock price during the 20-day measurement period is $35.52 or greater, the merger consideration will be 0.5743 shares of Verizon common stock per MCI share. If Verizon's average stock price during the measurement period is less than $35.52, the merger consideration will be increased to include additional Verizon common stock or cash (at Verizon's option) to ensure the value of the merger consideration is $20.40 assuming no downward purchase price adjustment.

MCI's Deal Process
MCI's Board conducted a thorough, fair and transparent process:
Extensive and even-handed negotiations with Verizon, Qwest and other parties throughout 2004 and 2005
Thoroughly considered all aspects of potential strategic alternatives
All directors and former SEC Chairman Richard Breeden, MCI's corporate monitor, participated throughout
MCI's Board had concerns about Qwest's proposals:
Risk of significant decline in Qwest stock price during extended period prior to closing
Impact on MCI enterprise business from significant negative customer reaction to a transaction with Qwest
Achievability of Qwest's claimed level of synergies
Qwest much less attractive partner than Verizon in competing against SBC / AT&T
Expected financial condition of Qwest after transaction (liquidity profile, debt level)
Qwest's contingent liabilities
11
 
Steps required to complete the merger
MCI shareholder vote DoJ approval FCC approval State approvals International approvals
12
 
Shareholder meeting on October 6
Approval by a majority of the outstanding MCI shares required No Verizon shareholder vote on the transaction is required No alternative offer for MCI is now available
If shareholders vote against the Verizon merger (or simply do not vote), then MCI will:
Lose the benefits of combining with Verizon including access economics and wireless capabilities
Face the challenges of competing on a stand-alone basis against AT&T/SBC and Sprint/Nextel
If another offer emerges, could require up to 12 to 18 months to obtain regulatory approvals with the potential of not closing until 2007
13
 
Important progress being made toward transaction completion in late 2005/early 2006
HSR notification and report forms filed in February 2005
Applications for FCC approval filed on March 11th
MCI and Verizon certified substantial compliance with DoJ 2nd Request on June 17th and May 27th, respectively
Approvals being sought from various state public service or public utility commissions or similar state regulatory bodies
Fifteen approvals already received from State PUC or other regulatory bodies
European Commission and other international approvals proceeding on course
Six international approvals secured
14
 
In conclusion
MCI Board unanimously approved and recommends a vote in favor of this merger
Customers prefer the Verizon merger
Merger with Verizon provides significant financial and operational strength
Merger with Verizon is a highly compelling value proposition for MCI shareholders
