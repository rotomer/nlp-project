Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
 
On January 6, 2006, Verizon Communications Inc. (the "Company") completed the merger (the "Merger") of MCI, Inc. ("MCI") with and into Eli Acquisition, LLC ("Merger Sub"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving company under the name MCI, LLC, in accordance with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 14, 2005, as amended as of March 4, 2005, March 29, 2005 and May 1, 2005 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among the Company, Merger Sub and MCI.
 
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, MCI stockholders received 0.5743 shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Company and a cash payment for each of the MCI shares they owned immediately prior to the merger. Verizon elected to make a supplemental cash payment of $2.738 per MCI share (or $779 million in the aggregate) rather than issue additional shares of Verizon common stock in the Merger so that the merger consideration to be received by MCI stockholders will equal at least $20.40 per share of MCI common stock. Verizon, Merger Sub and MCI mutually agreed that there would be no purchase price adjustment related to the amount of MCI liabilities.
 
This description of the Merger contained in this Item 2.01 does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement and the amendments to the Merger Agreement, which are incorporated by reference as Exhibit 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
The Company expects that, based upon the unaudited annual financial information of each of Verizon and MCI as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005, no additional financial statements or pro forma financial information will be required by Item 9.01 once Verizon completes and files its 2005 financial statements prior to 71 calendar days from the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K.
