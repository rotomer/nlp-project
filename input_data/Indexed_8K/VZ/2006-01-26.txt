Attached as an exhibit hereto is a press release and financial tables dated January 26, 2006 issued by Verizon Communications Inc.
 
Non-GAAP Measures
 
Verizon's press release and financial tables include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.
 
The consolidated statements of income before special items eliminate special items and non-recurring items of revenues, expenses, gains and losses primarily as a result of their non-operational and/or non-recurring nature. This also includes current and prior periods' operating revenues and operating expenses of significant operations sold, including Verizon's Hawaii wireline and directory operations which were sold during the second quarter of 2005. Management believes this presentation of operating performance assists readers in better understanding our results of operations and trends from period to period, consistent with management's evaluation of Verizon's consolidated and segment results of operations for a variety of internal measures including strategic business planning, capital allocation and compensation. Management believes that the consolidated statements of income before special items provide current and prior period results of operations on a comparable basis as well as provide trends that are more indicative of future operating results than GAAP results of operations, given the non-operational and/or non-recurring nature of the special items removed for purposes of reporting results of operations before special items. While some of these items have been periodically reported in Verizon's consolidated results of operations, such as significant severance and impairment charges, their occurrence in future periods is dependent upon future business and economic factors, among other evaluation criteria, and may frequently be beyond the control of management. As a result of these factors, management also provides this information externally, along with a complete reconciliation to their comparable GAAP amounts so readers have access to the detail and general nature of adjustments made to GAAP results. Descriptions of the special items are provided in the schedules accompanying the press release.
 
Management believes that Verizon's operating income margins adjusted to exclude net pension and other postretirement (OPEB) expenses, Domestic Telecom's operating income margins excluding pension/OPEB, Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer and Verizon Wireless's operating income before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and EBITDA margin, additional non-GAAP financial measures, are also useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating financial performance. Operating income margins excluding net pension/OPEB expenses are non-GAAP operating performance measures used internally to evaluate current and prior operating expense efficiency, as well as assist management in evaluating the financial results of Verizon and its largest operating segment with and without a significant expense driver compared to prior periods. Management believes this presentation assists readers in better understanding the impact of this significant expense driver on our results of operations and trends from period to period. In addition, Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer is determined by subtracting equipment and other revenue from Verizon Wireless's cost of sales and services and selling, general and administrative expenses, divided by average customers during the period. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA is determined by adding-back depreciation and amortization to operating income and the Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Verizon Wireless's EBITDA by Verizon Wireless's service revenues. Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer, EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP operating performance measures that are used internally to evaluate current operating expense efficiency and operating profitability on a more variable cost basis by excluding the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions (particularly customer base amortization) that occurred in prior years. Cash expense per customer is determined by reflecting equipment and other revenue on a net cost basis in order to illustrate the impact of the net cost of selling handsets and other equipment to the customers and other similar transactions with customers. In addition, Verizon management uses this information to evaluate operating performance in relation to Verizon Wireless's competitors. The Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin utilizes service revenues rather than total revenues. Service revenues exclude primarily equipment revenues (as well as other non-service revenues) in order to capture the impact of providing service to the wireless customer base on an ongoing basis. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA margin is presented along with Verizon Wireless's operating income margin so as not to imply more emphasis should be placed on it than the corresponding GAAP measure. Management believes this presentation assists readers in preparing comparisons of this type of performance measure (operating profitability) using the GAAP measure as well as the measure segment management evaluates segment results and performs comparisons to other wireless carriers.
It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance understanding of Verizon's GAAP consolidated financial statements and should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) today reported strong fourth-quarter and year-end 2005 results, highlighted by an industry-record quarterly total for net new wireline broadband connections, as well as continued record growth and sustained margins at Verizon Wireless.
NEW YORK 
 
For the fourth quarter 2005, Verizon reported earnings of $1.7 billion, or 59 cents per diluted share, compared with $3.0 billion, or $1.08 per share, in the fourth quarter 2004. Reported earnings in the fourth quarter 2005 include non-recurring net expenses for previously announced changes to management retirement benefit plans, as well as severance and relocation costs. The fourth quarter 2004 principally included non-recurring gains from sales of non-strategic assets and tax benefits.
 
Before special items, earnings were 64 cents per share in both the fourth quarter 2005 and the fourth quarter 2004.
 
For the year, Verizon reported earnings of $7.4 billion, or $2.65 per share, in 2005, compared with $7.8 billion, or $2.79 per share, in 2004. Before special items, earnings were $7.2 billion, or $2.56 per share, in 2005, compared with $7.0 billion, or $2.51 per share, in 2004.
 
 
"Verizon finished the year strongly, and as we begin 2006 our strategies are taking root," said Ivan Seidenberg, Verizon chairman and CEO. "We continue to grow what is already a great customer base  especially as we continue to introduce innovations in wireless and broadband services.
Verizon News Release, page 3
 
"At the same time, we are investing in our powerful networks to position Verizon for additional growth in the future. We see real momentum in these growth initiatives, and we look forward to seizing the opportunities we see in the large-business market with our new Verizon Business unit."
 
 
Quarterly consolidated operating revenues reached $19.3 billion in the fourth quarter 2005. On a comparable basis (non-GAAP, excluding revenues in both periods from operations that Verizon sold in 2005), consolidated operating revenues increased 6.7 percent from $18.1 billion in the fourth quarter 2004.
 
Verizon's growth businesses  wireless, broadband, data and long-distance services  contributed 59.6 percent to fourth-quarter 2005 revenues, compared with a 54.9 percent contribution to fourth-quarter 2004 revenues.
 
Annual consolidated operating revenues were $75.1 billion in 2005, or $74.9 billion excluding revenues from operations since sold. On a comparable basis, this is a revenue increase of 6.0 percent from $70.7 billion in 2004.
 
Total operating expenses were $15.6 billion in the fourth quarter 2005 and $60.3 billion for the full year, up 4.8 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively, from the similar periods in 2004.
 
 
Verizon's total customer connections  which include wireline switched access lines, wireless customers, and wireline and wireless customers using broadband connections (EV-DO, DSL or FiOS)  increased to 105.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter 2005. This is an
Verizon News Release, page 4
 
increase of 5.7 percent compared with the fourth quarter 2004, and an increase of 1.8 million customer connections compared with the end of the third quarter 2005.
 
Switched access lines totaled 48.8 million at the end of the fourth quarter 2005, a decline of 6.7 percent compared with the end of the fourth quarter 2004. This has been more than offset by increases of 47.6 percent in wireline broadband connections and 17.2 percent in total wireless customers over the same period.
 
 
Verizon's consolidated operating income margin was 19.2 percent in the fourth quarter 2005, compared with 18.4 percent in the fourth quarter 2004. When adjusted to exclude the special and non-recurring items as well as net pension and OPEB (other post-retirement benefits) impact, Verizon's consolidated operating income margin would have been 22.1 percent in the fourth quarter 2005 and 20.2 percent in the fourth quarter 2004 (non-GAAP measures)  the fourth consecutive quarter of gains in consolidated margins.
 
Cash Flows From Operations were $22.0 billion in 2005, compared with $21.8 billion in 2004. In 2005, net cash used in investing activities was $18.5 billion, including $15.3 billion in capital expenditures. Net cash used in financing activities was $5.0 billion.
 
Verizon's total debt decreased $0.3 billion compared with year-end 2004, to $39.0 billion at year-end 2005.
 
 
At Verizon Wireless, record growth and profitability in the fourth quarter 2005 built on the momentum of its sustained strong performance, quarter after quarter. This was the 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit, year-over-year revenue growth; the seventh consecutive
Verizon News Release, page 5
 
quarter that the company added more than 1.5 million customers, and the fourth consecutive quarter of EBITDA margins of more than 40 percent.
 
Verizon Wireless added 7.5 million net new customers over the last 12 months and now has 51.3 million customers nationwide.
 
The company continued to set records for low churn, a key measure of customer loyalty, with total churn of 1.2 percent for the fourth quarter 2005 (matching the company's previous quarterly record) and 1.3 percent for the year. Churn among the company's 47 million retail postpaid customers was even lower  1.0 percent for the quarter and 1.1 percent for the year.
 
Verizon Wireless revenues were $8.7 billion in the fourth quarter 2005, an 18.3 percent increase compared with $7.3 billion in the fourth quarter 2004  driven by continued strong customer growth and demand for data services. Full-year 2005 wireless revenues were $32.3 billion, an increase of 16.8 percent compared with 2004.
 
Wireless operating income margins were 25.8 percent for the fourth quarter and 22.8 percent for the year, the result of the company's continued focus on managing costs and efficiencies as it added record numbers of customers.
 
Wireless EBITDA margins were 46.8 percent for the fourth quarter and 43.2 percent for the year. (EBITDA  or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization  is a non-GAAP measure that adds depreciation and amortization to operating income; EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing EBITDA by wireless service revenues.)
 
 
Verizon's wireline business segment added a net of 613,000 wireline broadband connections in the fourth quarter 2005. This is a broadband industry record, topping any prior quarterly total posted by a telecommunications or cable company.
Verizon News Release, page 6
 
This brings the company's year-end total to 5.1 million wireline broadband connections, representing 1.7 million net additions in 2005  a growth rate of 47.6 percent compared with year-end 2004. Wireline broadband connections include totals for both DSL and FiOS, Verizon's next-generation, fiber-optic-based service.
 
Operating revenues on a comparable basis at Domestic Telecom were $9.4 billion in the fourth quarter 2005, a 1.8 percent decrease compared with the fourth quarter 2004. For the year, comparable wireline operating revenues were $37.6 billion, a 1.1 percent decrease compared with 2004.
 
Revenues from DSL and FiOS data contributed to total wireline data revenues of $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter 2005, a 9.0 percent increase compared with the fourth quarter 2004. For the year, data revenues of $8.5 billion grew 10.5 percent compared with 2004 and now represent 23.4 percent of total wireline revenues, up from 21.1 percent at the end of 2004.
 
Long-distance services including regional toll services, another wireline growth area, contributed $1.1 billion to total wireline revenues in the fourth quarter 2005 and $4.3 billion in the full year, up 2.7 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively, compared with the similar periods in 2004.
 
Operating income margin for the wireline segment was 11.1 percent in fourth quarter 2005 and 12.7 percent for the year, compared with 15.0 percent and 14.9 percent in the similar periods in 2004. When adjusted to exclude the net pension and OPEB impact, wireline's operating income margin would have been 14.5 percent in the fourth quarter 2005 and 16.1 percent for the year, compared with 17.1 percent and 17.0 percent in the similar periods in 2004 (non-GAAP measures). For 2006, Verizon is targeting comparable annual operating income margins of about 16 percent.
Verizon News Release, page 7
 
Consistent with past practice, Verizon believes that excluding the impact of net pension and OPEB expenses or credits enhances comparability, providing a better picture of operating cost management.
 
 
Verizon's reported fourth-quarter 2005 earnings of $1.7 billion, or 59 cents per share, primarily included non-recurring expenses of $59 million, or 2 cents per share, to recognize the net effect of the restructuring of management retirement benefit plans announced in December 2005, and 1 cent per share in expenses each for a voluntary severance program for union-represented employees ($36 million) and for net relocation costs associated with the new Verizon Center in New Jersey ($29 million).
 
Fourth-quarter 2004 earnings of $1.08 per share included net gains of $1.0 billion, or 36 cents per share, from the sales of Verizon Information Services Canada and Verizon's investment stake in TELUS Corp.; and tax benefits of $234 million, or 8 cents per share, from previous investment-related losses.
 
Verizon's reported year-end 2005 earnings of $7.4 billion, or $2.65 per share, also included non-recurring gains of $336 million each, or 12 cents per share each, related to the sale of wireline and directory operations in Hawaii, and for tax benefits recognized on prior-year investment losses. These gains were partially offset by net tax expense of $206 million, or 7 cents per share, for the repatriation of foreign earnings, as well as asset impairments at Verizon's leasing operations and other costs of $133 million, or 5 cents per share.
 
Reported year-end 2004 earnings of $7.8 billion, or $2.79 per share, also included $499 million, or 18 cents per share, in severance-related charges, partially offset by a $43 million, or 2 cents per share, gain on the sale of an investment.
Verizon News Release, page 8
 
Net pension and OPEB costs reduced Verizon's earnings by 30 cents per share in 2005, compared with 21 cents per share in 2004. The earnings dilution from FiOS was 15 cents per share in 2005, compared with 4 cents per share in 2004.
 
 
In 2006, Verizon expects that net pension and OPEB costs will reduce earnings by 34 cents to 36 cents per share, compared with the 30 cents per share noted above.
 
Regarding 2006 capital spending, the company reiterated previous guidance of from $15.4 billion to $15.7 billion, excluding capital related to Verizon's recently closed merger with MCI, Inc. Verizon announced today that, with MCI, total 2006 capital spending is expected to be from $17.0 billion to $17.4 billion. This includes about $550 million in integration capital in 2006 to improve efficiencies and help achieve merger synergies, which have a net present value of approximately $8 billion in incremental revenues and operational savings, including investments in network and systems to achieve these savings.
 
Network savings represent nearly half of the synergies, as bringing traffic onto Verizon's networks is expected to save more than $200 million in 2006. Workforce reductions and information technology savings each represent about 20 percent of the synergy totals.
 
 
Related to the merger closing, Verizon Business  the industry's new provider of advanced communications and information technology solutions to large businesses and government - earlier this week unveiled a robust line of integrated services, including new integrated wireless and wireline network access offerings.
