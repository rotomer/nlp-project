VIII. INDEMNIFICATION The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Reselling Purchaser and each person, if any, who controls such Reselling Purchaser within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (if used within the period set forth in Paragraph (D) of Article VI hereof, and as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are based upon any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished to the Company by any Reselling Purchaser or the Representative by or on behalf of any Reselling Purchaser in writing expressly for use therein or by any statement or omission in the Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee under the Indenture. Each Reselling Purchaser severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and any person controlling the Company to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Reselling Purchaser, but only with reference to information relating to said Reselling Purchaser furnished to the Company in writing by the Reselling Purchaser or the Representative by or on behalf of said Reselling Purchaser expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus. In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person or persons against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding (provided, however, that if such indemnified party shall object to the selection of counsel after having been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the indemnified party which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall designate other counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party) and the indemnifying party shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. -8-
If the indemnification provided for in this Article VIII is unavailable to an indemnified party under the first or second paragraph hereof or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party shall severally contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Reselling Purchasers on the other from the offering of the New Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Reselling Purchasers on the other in connection with the statement or omission that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Reselling Purchasers on the other in connection with the offering of the New Notes shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the New Notes received by Company bear to the total commissions, if any, received by all of the Reselling Purchasers in respect thereof. If there are no commissions allowed or paid by the Company to the Reselling Purchasers in respect of the New Notes, the relative benefits received by the Reselling Purchasers in the preceding sentence shall be the difference between the price received by such Reselling Purchasers upon resale of the New Notes and the price paid for the New Notes pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Reselling Purchasers on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Reselling Purchasers and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in this Article VIII shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article VIII, no Reselling Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the New Notes purchased by it under this Agreement and resold as contemplated herein and in the Prospectus exceeds the amount of any damages which such Reselling Purchaser has otherwise paid or becomes liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Reselling Purchasers' obligations to contribute as provided in this Article VIII are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint. IX. SURVIVAL The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in Article VIII and the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Article VII of this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, -9-
(ii) any investigation made by any Reselling Purchaser or on behalf of any Reselling Purchaser or any persons controlling any Reselling Purchaser and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the New Notes. X. TERMINATION BY RESELLING PURCHASERS At any time prior to the Closing Date this Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Reselling Purchasers, by notice given to the Company, if (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or materially limited, (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, (iii) minimum prices shall have been established on the New York Stock Exchange by Federal or New York State authorities or (iv) any outbreak or material escalation of hostilities involving the United States or declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis shall have occurred, the effect of any of which is such as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the delivery of the New Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus. XI. TERMINATION BY PURCHASERS If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Purchasers because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason (other than those set forth in Article V) the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Purchasers for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by such Purchasers in connection with the New Notes. Except as provided herein, the Purchasers shall bear all of their expenses, including the fees and disbursements of counsel. XII. SUBSTITUTION OF PURCHASERS If for any reason any Purchaser shall not purchase the New Notes it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the remaining Purchasers shall have the right within 24 hours to make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such New Notes hereunder. If they fail to do so, the amounts of New Notes that the remaining Purchasers are obligated, severally, to purchase under this Agreement shall be increased in the proportions which the total amount of New Notes which they have respectively agreed to purchase bears to the total amount of New Notes which all non-defaulting Purchasers have so agreed to purchase, or in such other proportions as the Purchasers may specify to absorb such unpurchased New Notes, provided that such aggregate increases shall not exceed 10% of the total amount of the New Notes set forth in Schedule A to the Purchase Agreement. If any unpurchased New Notes still remain, the Company shall have the right either to elect to consummate the sale except as to any such unpurchased New Notes so remaining or, within the next succeeding 24 hours, to make arrangements satisfactory to the remaining Purchasers for the purchase of such New Notes. In any such cases, either the Purchasers or the Representative or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for not more than seven business days to a mutually acceptable -10-
date. If the Company shall not elect to so consummate the sale and any unpurchased New Notes remain for which no satisfactory substitute Purchaser is obtained in accordance with the above provisions, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Purchaser or the Company for the purchase or sale of any New Notes under this Agreement. No provision in this paragraph shall relieve any defaulting Purchaser of liability to the Company for damages occasioned by such default. XIII. NO ADVISORY OR FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP The Company acknowledges and agrees that (a) the purchase and sale of the New Notes pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the public offering price of the New Notes and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Purchasers, on the other hand, (b) in connection with the offering contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction each Purchaser is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, or its stockholders, creditors, employees or any other party, (c) no Purchaser has assumed or will assume an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Purchaser has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) and no Purchaser has any obligation to the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement, (d) the Purchasers and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company, and (e) the Purchasers have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the Company has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent deemed by it to be appropriate. XIV. MISCELLANEOUS This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of New York. -11-
EXHIBIT A [Letterhead of General Counsel of Verizon Communications Inc.] and the other several Purchasers referred to in the Purchase Agreement dated____________________, among such Purchasers and Verizon Communications Inc. Re: Verizon Communications Inc. ___% Notes due ____ Dear Sirs: I have been requested by Verizon Communications Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), as Executive Vice President and General Counsel of the Company, to furnish you with my opinion pursuant to a Purchase Agreement dated ______, (the "Agreement") among the Company and you, relating to the purchase and sale of $___,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's ___% Notes due ___ (the "New Notes"). In this connection I, or attorneys under my direction, have examined among other things: (a) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company, each as presently in effect; (b) A copy of the indenture dated as of December 1, 2000 (the "Original Indenture"), under which the New Notes are being issued, as supplemented by the supplemental indenture dated as of May 15, 2001 (the "First Supplemental Indenture"), as further supplemented by the supplemental indenture dated as of September 29, 2004 (the "Second Supplemental Indenture") and as further supplemented by the supplemental indenture dated as of February 1, 2006 (the "Third Supplemental Indenture", and together with the Original Indenture, the First Supplemental Indenture and the Second Supplemental Indenture, the "Indenture"), between the Company, as successor in interest to Verizon Global Funding Corp., and Wachovia Bank, National Association, formerly known as First Union National Bank (the "Trustee"); (c) [The Supplemental Indenture, dated as of ____________ between the Company and the Trustee] [The resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company adopted ____________, (the "Board Resolution")] [The certificate, dated ____________, of authorized officers of the Company pursuant to authorization from the Board of Directors (the "Officers' Certificate")] specifically authorizing the New Notes, including the issuance and sale of the New Notes; (d) The New Notes; (e) The Agreement; A-1
(f) The records of the corporate proceedings of the Company relating to the authorization, execution and delivery of the Indenture, [the Supplemental Indenture,] the Agreement and the New Notes; (g) The record of all proceedings taken by the Company relating to the registration of the New Notes under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "TIA"); (h) The Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, as each such term is defined in the Agreement, including all documents filed by the Company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), which are incorporated therein by reference (the "Incorporated Documents"). On the basis of my examination of the foregoing and of such other documents and matters as I have deemed necessary as the basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed, I am of the opinion that: 1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, is a duly licensed and qualified foreign corporation in good standing under the laws of those jurisdictions in which the Company's ownership of its property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification (except where the failure to so qualify would not have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects, properties, financial condition or results of operations of the Company), and has adequate corporate power to own and operate its properties and to carry on the business in which it is now engaged. 2. All legal proceedings necessary to the authorization, issue and sale of the New Notes have been taken by the Company. 3. The Agreement has been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. 4. The Indenture is in proper form, has been duly authorized, has been duly executed by the Company and the Trustee and delivered by the Company and constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as limited by bankruptcy, insolvency and other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and the availability of equitable remedies. The Indenture has been duly qualified under the TIA. 5. The New Notes conform as to legal matters with the statements concerning them in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, have been duly authorized and executed by the Company (assuming due authentication and delivery thereof by the Trustee) have been duly issued for value by the Company and (subject to the qualifications set forth in paragraph 4 above) constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms and are entitled to the benefits afforded by the Indenture. A-2
6. Except as may be required by the securities or Blue Sky laws of certain jurisdictions, no authorization, approval or consent of any governmental regulatory authority is required for the issuance and sale of the New Notes. 7. The execution and delivery of the Agreement and the Indenture and the consummation of the transactions contemplated therein will not result in a violation of or conflict with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any law, statute, order, decree, rule or regulation known to me of any court or governmental agency having jurisdiction over the Company or its property. 8. To my knowledge there is no litigation or governmental proceeding pending or threatened against the Company or its subsidiaries which would affect the subject matter of the Agreement. 9. The Registration Statement became effective under the Act and, to the best of my knowledge, no proceedings under Section 8 of the Act looking toward the possible issuance of a stop order with respect thereto are pending or threatened and the Registration Statement remains in effect on the date hereof. The Registration Statement as of its effective date (including each deemed effective date pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2)), the Pricing Prospectus as of the Applicable Time, as such term is defined in the Agreement, and the Prospectus as of the date thereof complied as to form in all material respects with the relevant provisions of the Act and of the Exchange Act as to the Incorporated Documents and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder, except that I express no opinion as to the financial statements or other financial data contained therein. The Prospectus is lawful for use for the purposes specified in the Act in connection with the offer for sale and sale of the New Notes in the manner therein specified. I have no reason to believe (A) that the Registration Statement and the Incorporated Documents, considered as a whole on the effective date of the Registration Statement (including each deemed effective date pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2)), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, (B) that the General Disclosure Package and the Incorporated Documents, considered as a whole as of the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (C) that the Prospectus and the Incorporated Documents, considered as a whole as of the date of the Prospectus and on the date hereof, contained or contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that in each case I express no opinion as to the financial statements or other financial data contained therein. Without my prior written consent, this opinion may not be relied upon by any person or entity other than the addressees, quoted in whole or in part, or otherwise referred to in any report or document, or furnished to any other person or entity, except that Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP may rely upon this opinion as if this opinion were separately addressed to them.

EXHIBIT B MILBANK, TWEED, HADLEY & McCLOY LLP 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza New York, New York 10005 VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. $___,000,000 __% Notes due ___ and the other several Purchasers referred to in the Purchase Agreement dated________________, among such Purchasers and Verizon Communications Inc. Ladies and Gentlemen: We have been designated by Verizon Communications Inc. (the "Company") as counsel for the purchasers of $___,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its __% Notes due ___ (the "New Notes"). Pursuant to such designation and the terms of a Purchase Agreement dated ________, relating to the New Notes (the "Purchase Agreement"), entered into by you with the Company, we have acted as your counsel in connection with your several purchases this day from the Company of the New Notes, which are issued under an Indenture dated as of December 1, 2000, as amended and supplemented (the "Indenture"), between the Company, as successor in interest to Verizon Global Funding Corp., and Wachovia Bank, National Association, formerly known as First Union National Bank, as Trustee. We have reviewed originals, or copies certified to our satisfaction, of such corporate records of the Company, indentures, agreements and other instruments, certificates of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company, and other documents, as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In such examination we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity with the original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. As to various questions of fact material to such opinions, we have, when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon certifications by officers of the Company and statements contained in the Registration Statement hereinafter mentioned. In addition, we attended the closing held today at the offices of the Company at One Verizon Way, Basking Ridge, New Jersey, at which the Company caused the New Notes to be delivered to and held by the Trustee on behalf of the Depository Trust Company, 55 Water Street, New York, New York, for your several accounts, against payment therefor. B-1
On the basis of the foregoing and having regard to legal considerations which we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that: 1. The Company is a validly existing corporation, in good standing, under the laws of the State of Delaware. 2. The Purchase Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by and on behalf of the Company. 3. The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws of general applicability affecting the enforceability of creditors' rights. The enforceability of the Indenture is subject to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including without limitation (i) the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (ii) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing. The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. 4. The New Notes have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and conform as to legal matters in all substantial respects to the description thereof contained in the Prospectus, as such term is defined in the Purchase Agreement. The New Notes (assuming due authentication and delivery by the Trustee) have been duly issued for value by the Company and (subject to the qualifications stated in paragraph 3 above) constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company, and are entitled to the benefits afforded by the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and of the New Notes. 5. On the basis of information received by the Company from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), the Registration Statement, as such term is defined in the Purchase Agreement, filed with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), is effective under the Act. The Prospectus is lawful for use for the purposes specified in the Act, in connection with the offer for sale and sale of the New Notes in the manner therein specified, subject to compliance with the provisions of securities or Blue Sky laws of certain States in connection with the offer for sale or sale of the New Notes in such States. To the best of our knowledge, the Registration Statement remains in effect at this date. 6. The Registration Statement, as of its effective date (including each deemed effective date pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2)), the Pricing Prospectus, as of the Applicable Time (as such term is defined in the Purchase Agreement), and the Prospectus, as of the date thereof, together with the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents") (except any financial statements or other financial data included in or omitted from, or incorporated by reference in, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or such Incorporated Documents, as to which no opinion is expressed) appear on their face to be appropriately responsive, in all material respects relevant to the offering of the New Notes, to the B-2
requirements of the Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as applicable, and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. None of the Registration Statement that was filed on Form S-3 under the Act, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus necessarily contain a current description of the Company's business and affairs, since Form S-3 provides for the incorporation by reference of certain documents filed with the Commission which contain descriptions as of various dates. We participated in conferences with counsel for, and representatives of, the Company in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus[,] [and] the Prospectus [and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus identified in Schedule B to the Purchase Agreement which constitutes part of the General Disclosure Package (as such term is defined in the Purchase Agreement)] and we have reviewed the Incorporated Documents. In connection with our participation in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus[,][and] the Prospectus [and such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus(es)], we have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained therein or in the Incorporated Documents, and the limitations inherent in the review made by us and the knowledge available to us are such that we are unable to assume, and we do not assume, any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus [, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus(es)] or the Incorporated Documents, except as otherwise specifically stated herein. None of the foregoing disclosed to us any information which gave us reason to believe that the Registration Statement and the Incorporated Documents, considered as a whole on the effective date of the Registration Statement (including each deemed effective date pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2)), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or that the General Disclosure Package and the Incorporated Documents, considered as a whole as of the Applicable Time, as such term is defined in the Purchase Agreement, or the Prospectus and the Incorporated Documents, considered as a whole on the date thereof and on the date hereof, contained or contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. We express no opinion as to any document filed by the Company under the Exchange Act, whether prior or subsequent to such effective date, except to the extent that such documents are Incorporated Documents read together with the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus and considered as a whole, nor do we express any opinion as to the financial statements or other financial data included in or omitted from, or incorporated by reference, in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or the Incorporated Documents. We express no opinion as to matters governed by any laws other than the laws of the State of New York, the Federal laws of the United States of America, the corporate laws of the State of Delaware and, to the extent the foregoing opinions involve laws other than the laws of the State of New York, the Federal laws of the United States of America or the corporate laws of the State of Delaware, in reliance upon the opinion of even date herewith of the General Counsel of the Company, such other laws. B-3
The opinions contained herein are rendered to you and are solely for your benefit and the benefit of the Purchasers represented by you in connection with the transaction contemplated by the Purchase Agreement.

The Company will pay interest in arrears on each Interest Payment Date (as defined below), commencing with the first Interest Payment Date next succeeding ___________ (the "Original Issue Date"), and on the Maturity Date. Interest on this Debt Security will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed.

The amount of accrued interest payable for any Interest Period shall be calculated by multiplying the face amount of this Debt Security by an accrued interest factor. Such accrued interest factor is computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day from the Original Issue Date, or from the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, to the date for which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor for each day shall be computed by dividing the Interest Rate applicable to such day by 360.
If the Maturity Date of this Debt Security falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, as if made on the date such payment was due, and no interest on such payment shall accrue on such payment for the period from and after the Maturity Date to the date of such payment on the next succeeding Business Day.

The Interest Rate shall be reset each ________ (each an "Interest Reset Date"), commencing ______, ____ (the "Initial Interest Reset Date"). The Interest Rate in effect on each day that is not an Interest Reset Date shall be the Interest Rate determined as of the second London Business Day (as defined below) preceding the applicable Interest Reset Date (each an "Interest Determination Date") pertaining to the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date and the Interest Rate in effect on any day that is an Interest Reset Date shall be the Interest Rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date pertaining to such Interest Reset Date; provided, however, that the interest rate in effect for the period from the Original Issue Date to the first Interest Reset Date shall be the Initial Interest Rate. If any Interest Reset Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, except that if such Business Day falls in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.

on such Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in United States dollars in such market at such time. If at least two such quotations are so provided, then LIBOR on such Interest Determination Date shall be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, then LIBOR on such Interest Determination Date shall be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 A.M., in The City of New York, on such Interest Determination Date by three major banks in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent for loans in United States dollars to leading European banks, having a __ month maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in United States dollars in such market at such time; provided, however, that if the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, LIBOR determined as of such Interest Determination Date shall be LIBOR in effect on such Interest Determination Date. "Telerate Page 3750" means the display designated as "Page 3750" on Telerate, Inc. (or any successor service) for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for United States dollars. The Interest Rate applicable to each Interest Period commencing on the related Interest Reset Date shall be the rate determined as of the applicable Interest Determination Date on or prior to the Calculation Date (as defined below). The Calculation Agent (which initially shall be Wachovia Bank, National Association and which may be changed by the Company from time to time) shall calculate the Interest Rate on this Debt Security on or before each Calculation Date and, upon request, provide holders of the Debt Securities the Interest Rate then in effect and, if determined, the Interest Rate which shall become effective as a result of a determination made for the next succeeding Interest Reset Date with respect to this Debt Security. The Calculation Agent's determination of any interest rate shall be final and binding absent error in the calculation thereof. The "Calculation Date" pertaining to any Interest Determination Date shall be the earlier of (a) the tenth calendar day after such Interest Determination Date, or if any such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day, or (b) the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the other provisions herein, the Interest Rate hereon shall in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law, as the same may be modified by United States law of general application. Except as otherwise provided herein, all percentages resulting from any calculation shall be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)), and all amounts used in or resulting from such calculation shall be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward). The Company is obligated to make payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, in respect of this Debt Security in United States dollars. This Debt Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, or be valid or become obligatory for any purpose, until the Certificate of Authentication hereon shall have been signed by or on behalf of the Trustee. The provisions of this Debt Security are continued on the reverse side hereof and such continued provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place. 3
