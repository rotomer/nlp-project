The Notes are governed by the terms of the Indentures, each dated as of April 20, 2004, among the Original Issuer, certain subsidiaries of the Original Issuer and Citibank, N.A., as amended (collectively as amended, the Indentures). The Indentures contain provisions that would apply upon a change of control of the Original Issuer. On January 6, 2006, MCI, Inc. was merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon), with the subsidiary changing its name to MCI, LLC (the Company) and continuing as the surviving person under the terms of the Indentures. The merger constituted a change of control of the Original Issuer under the Indentures and the Company has assumed the obligations of the Original Issuer under the Indentures. Pursuant to the change of control provisions of the Indentures, the Company offered to purchase all or a portion of the Notes for a purchase price, in cash, equal to $1,010 per $1,000 of Notes tendered by noteholders.
On February 21, 2006, the Company accepted for payment $1,804,261,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2007 Notes for a purchase price, in cash, equal to $1,822,303,610, plus accrued interest in the amount of $38,083,940.24 resulting in a total purchase price of $1,860,387,550.24. On February 22, 2006, the Company will accept for payment $164,674,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2009 Notes for a purchase price, in cash, equal to $166,320,740, plus accrued interest in the amount of $3,903,542.28 resulting in a total purchase price of $170,224,282.28. All of the 2014 Notes, including 2014 Notes previously tendered by noteholders under the change of control offer but not yet accepted for payment, were redeemed by the Company on February 16, 2006 at a price that exceeded the price specified in the change of control offer.
