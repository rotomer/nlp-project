Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Attached as an exhibit hereto is a press release and financial tables dated May 2, 2006 issued by Verizon Communications Inc.
Non-GAAP Measures
Verizon's press release and financial tables include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.
The consolidated statements of income before special items eliminate special items and non-recurring items of revenues, expenses, gains and losses primarily as a result of their non-operational and/or non-recurring nature. This also includes current and prior periods' operating revenues and operating expenses of significant operations sold, including Verizon's Hawaii wireline and directory operations which were sold during the second quarter of 2005. Management believes this presentation of operating performance assists readers in better understanding our results of operations and trends from period to period, consistent with management's evaluation of Verizon's consolidated and segment results of operations for a variety of internal measures including strategic business planning, capital allocation and compensation. Management believes that the consolidated statements of income before special items provide current and prior period results of operations on a comparable basis as well as provide trends that are more indicative of future operating results than GAAP results of operations, given the non-operational and/or non-recurring nature of the special items removed for purposes of reporting results of operations before special items. While some of these items have been periodically reported in Verizon's consolidated results of operations, their occurrence in future periods is dependent upon future business and economic factors, among other evaluation criteria, and may frequently be beyond the control of management. As a result of these factors, management also provides this information externally, along with a complete reconciliation to their comparable GAAP amounts so readers have access to the detail and general nature of adjustments made to GAAP results. Descriptions of the special items are provided in the schedules accompanying the press release.
Management believes that Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer and Verizon Wireless's operating income before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and EBITDA margin, additional non-GAAP financial measures, are also useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating financial performance. Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer is determined by subtracting equipment and other revenue from Verizon Wireless's cost of sales and services and selling, general and administrative expenses, divided by average customers during the period. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA is determined by adding-back depreciation and amortization to operating income and the Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Verizon Wireless's EBITDA by Verizon Wireless's service revenues. Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer, EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP operating performance measures that are used internally to evaluate current operating expense efficiency and operating profitability on a more variable cost basis by excluding the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions (particularly customer base amortization) that occurred in prior years. Cash expense per customer is determined by reflecting equipment and other revenue on a net cost basis in order to illustrate the impact of the net cost of selling handsets and other equipment to the customers and other similar transactions with customers. In addition, Verizon management uses this information to evaluate operating performance in relation to Verizon Wireless's competitors. The Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin utilizes service revenues rather than total revenues. Service revenues exclude primarily equipment revenues (as well as other non-service revenues) in order to capture the impact of providing service to the wireless customer base on an ongoing basis. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA margin is presented along with Verizon Wireless's operating income margin so as not to imply more emphasis should be placed on it than the corresponding GAAP measure. Management believes this presentation assists readers in preparing comparisons of this type of performance measure (operating profitability) using the GAAP measure as well as the measure segment management evaluates segment results and performs comparisons to other wireless carriers.
The pro forma financial information presents the combined operating results of Verizon and the former MCI on a comparable basis, before special items and non-recurring items. Management believes this presentation of pro forma financial information before special items assists readers in better understanding our results of operations and trends from period to period, consistent with management's evaluation of Verizon's consolidated and segment results of operations for a variety of internal measures. Management believes that the pro forma financial information provides current and prior period results of operations on a comparable basis as well as provides trends that are more indicative of future operating results than GAAP results of operations, given the merger during the period and the non-operational and/or non-recurring nature of the special items removed for purposes of reporting results of operations before special items. Management provides this information externally, along with a complete reconciliation to their comparable GAAP amounts so readers have access to the detail and general nature of adjustments made to GAAP results. Descriptions of these special items are provided in the schedules accompanying the press release.
It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance understanding of Verizon's GAAP consolidated financial statements and should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

Notes: Reclassifications of prior-period amounts have been made to reflect comparable results excluding Verizon's Hawaii wireline and directory operations, which were sold in the second quarter 2005. See the schedules accompanying this news release and www.verizon.com/investor for reconciliations to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the non-GAAP financial measures included in this announcement.
Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) today reported strong financial and operational results for the first quarter 2006. Verizon Wireless continued to lead the industry in profitable growth and customer loyalty, and Verizon's wireline business sustained industry-leading levels of broadband customer growth and, after the completion of the MCI, Inc. merger, greatly expanded its global presence in business and government markets.
NEW YORK 
For the first quarter 2006, Verizon reported earnings of $1.6 billion, or 56 cents per diluted share, compared with $1.8 billion, or 63 cents per share, in the first quarter 2005. Reported earnings in the first quarter 2006 reflect 4 cents per share in special items for employee relocations and merger integration costs, the early extinguishment of debt, and the cumulative effect of an accounting change. Before these special items (non-GAAP), Verizon's earnings were 60 cents per share in the first quarter 2006.
Consolidated operating revenues in the first quarter 2006 were $22.7 billion, a 25.1 percent increase compared with the first quarter 2005; consolidated total operating expenses were $18.9 billion, a 27.6 percent increase compared with the first quarter 2005; and consolidated operating income was $3.9 billion, a 14.0 percent increase compared with the first quarter 2005. Reported results include MCI subsequent to the close of the merger on Jan. 6, 2006.
Verizon News Release, page 3
 
On a pro-forma basis (non-GAAP), comparing first quarter 2006 with first quarter 2005, adjusted earnings per share decreased 3.3 percent, adjusted operating revenues increased 3.1 percent and adjusted operating income increased 13.5 percent. Adjusted operating income margins would have been 17.2 percent in first quarter 2006, compared with 15.6 percent in first quarter 2005. Pro-forma adjusted information presents the combined operating results of Verizon and the former MCI on a comparable basis.
"Our financial performance in the first quarter was on target, and we are focused on driving revenue growth in each of our business segments," said Ivan Seidenberg, Verizon chairman and CEO. "Our goal is simple: Given the quality of our superior networks and customer service, we expect Verizon Wireless and our wireline segment  Verizon Telecom and Verizon Business  to lead the industry, not necessarily in size but in profitable growth.
"Verizon Wireless is already there, and this quarter it has once again enhanced its position as the industry leader in terms of network reliability and customer loyalty. Verizon Telecom is taking the necessary steps to ramp up revenue growth from fiber-based FiOS data and TV services, and Verizon Business is already seeing revenue growth in strategic IP-based business services.
"This quarter also demonstrates Verizon's continued focus on delivering increased value to shareowners as well as to customers. We have repurchased shares, and we are divesting operations that are not core to our strategy of building network-based businesses that create new markets and drive profitable growth."
Verizon News Release, page 4
 
Verizon Wireless continued to surpass performance milestones previously set by the company and the industry with record net customer additions and profitability for a first quarter, and all-time industry low churn among major carriers.
This was the 15th consecutive quarter of double-digit, year-over-year revenue growth. It was also the eighth consecutive quarter that the company added more than 1.5 million customers, the fifth consecutive quarter with EBITDA margins above 40 percent and the 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in gross customer additions.
Verizon Wireless added 1.7 million net new customers in the first quarter 2006, for a total of 53.0 million customers nationwide, representing a 16.7 percent increase from the first quarter last year. At the end of the first quarter 2006, the company was the fastest growing in the industry in terms of customers, adding a net of 7.6 million new customers in the past 12 months.
Verizon Wireless continued to set new records for the company and the industry for low customer churn, a key measure of customer loyalty. For the first quarter 2006, total churn was a record-low 1.18 percent, and churn among the company's retail postpaid customers was 0.92 percent, another record.
Verizon Wireless revenues grew 18.8 percent to $8.8 billion in the first quarter 2006, driven by continued strong customer growth and demand for data services. At $872 million, wireless data revenues accounted for nearly 11.5 percent of total wireless service revenues in the quarter.
Wireless operating income margins were 24.0 percent in the quarter, reflecting the company's ability to maintain industry-leading cost efficiency even as it added the most retail customers.
Verizon News Release, page 5
 
Wireless EBITDA margins were 44.5 percent. (EBITDA  or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization  is a non-GAAP measure that adds depreciation and amortization to operating income; EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing EBITDA by wireless service revenues.)
Verizon's wireline business added 541,000 net broadband connections in the first quarter. Verizon now has 5.7 million wireline broadband connections, which includes both DSL and FiOS, Verizon's next-generation, fiber-optic-based service. Verizon has added nearly 1.2 million net wireline broadband connections over the past six months and 1.8 million net broadband connections over the past year, a growth rate of 47.1 percent comparing the first quarter 2006 with the first quarter 2005.
Strong sales of Verizon Freedom packages, which offer local wireline services with various combinations of long-distance and Internet access, were instrumental in retaining retail wireline customers. More than 6.3 million Verizon Freedom packages were in service to mass market (residential and small business) customers by the end of the first quarter 2006, an increase of 1.6 million since the end of the first quarter 2005 and 0.8 million since year-end 2005.
Following the MCI merger, Verizon's wireline business segment includes both Verizon Telecom and Verizon Business operations. Total wireline operating revenues were $12.5 billion in the first quarter 2006, an increase of 33.3 percent compared with the first quarter 2005 on an adjusted basis (non-GAAP)  excluding revenues from operations sold in 2005. Total wireline operating expenses were $11.4 billion in the first quarter 2006, a 40.6 percent increase compared with the first quarter 2005 on the same basis.
Verizon News Release, page 6
 
The MCI integration is on plan, and Verizon Business is ahead of plan to achieve the $550 million target in merger synergies this year. Approximately $50 million in merger synergies were realized in the first quarter 2006, and this is expected to ramp up to total $150 million by the end of the second quarter. A total of $400 million in synergies is expected in the second half of the year. Synergies include reducing the workforce by approximately 3,500 in 2006, and to date the company is about a third of the way toward this target.
Network traffic migration and systems integration plans are ahead of plan, including the migration of more than 80 percent of the voice traffic from the legacy Verizon Global Network Services network and 68 percent of all IP (Internet protocol) traffic onto the Verizon Business network. Systems integration includes consolidation of systems for the unit's sales force and product catalogs.
Since its launch in January, Verizon Business has rolled out a steady stream of new products and services that demonstrate immediate benefits for large business and government customers. For example, simultaneous with its formal market entry, Verizon Business unveiled integrated wireless and wireline offerings designed to enhance workforce mobility and provide reliable backup for customer data networks.
Verizon Business has capitalized on this initial momentum by expanding Verizon's Ethernet access services in key cities in the U.S., Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, and integrating these services with Private IP, the business unit's fastest-growing service.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities were $6.1 billion in the first quarter 2006, compared with $3.9 billion in the first quarter 2005, primarily due to lower distributions from the Verizon Wireless partnership, lower pension contributions in the first quarter 2006 and the absence of the tax payments that were made in the first quarter 2005 related to 2004 asset sales.
First-quarter capital expenditures were $4.1 billion in 2006, including an increase in wireline investment primarily driven by the inclusion of MCI, compared with $3.6 billion in 2005.
Total debt increased to $43.1 billion, compared with $39.0 billion at year-end 2005, primarily due to the assumption of MCI debt. Verizon either redeemed or refinanced the MCI debt in the first quarter 2006, resulting in an expected $190 million in interest expense savings in 2006.
In the first quarter 2006, Verizon repurchased 11.6 million shares at a cost of $0.4 billion. As previously announced, the company has a target of $1 billion in share repurchases in 2006.
Following are first-quarter 2006 highlights for Verizon's business segments.

Information Services and International:
In December 2005, Verizon announced that it is exploring divesting Verizon Information Services (VIS) through a spin-off, sale or other strategic transaction. However, since this process is still ongoing, VIS' results of operations, financial position and cash flows remain in continuing operations. In April 2006, Verizon announced that definitive agreements were reached to sell its Verizon International interests in the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Venezuela. Since Verizon committed to the divestitures after the end of the first quarter 2006, the operations are included in the International segment as continuing operations for the first quarter 2006.
