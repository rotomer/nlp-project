Item 8.01 Other Events.
On April 3, 2006, Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon) entered into definitive agreements to sell our interests in our Caribbean and Latin American operations in three separate transactions to Amrica Mvil, S.A. de C.V. (Amrica Mvil), a wireless service provider throughout Latin America, and a company owned jointly by Telfonos de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (Telmex) and Amrica Mvil. Accordingly, our interests in the consolidated operations to be sold  Puerto Rico Telephone and Verizon Dominicana  will be classified as discontinued operations beginning with the second quarter of 2006. As a convenience to investors who may want to consider the effects of the above, we are making available unaudited historical consolidated financial information for the last five quarters restated for the new discontinued operations presentation. In addition, we are also making available unaudited pro forma financial information for the last five quarters. The pro forma financial information reflects the merger with MCI. The restatement of the historical results and the pro forma presentation for the last five quarters and for the year-ended December 31, 2005, are provided as Exhibit 99.1, 99.2 and 99.3 hereto. Exhibit 99.4 includes pro forma information for the wireline segment and includes reclassifications within the wireline segment.
The unaudited pro forma results are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect the realization of potential cost savings, and any related integration costs. Certain cost savings may result from the merger; however, there can be no assurance that these cost savings will be achieved. Cost savings, if achieved, could result from, among other things, the reduction of overhead expenses, including employee levels and the elimination of duplicate facilities and capital expenditures. These pro forma results do not purport to be indicative of the results that would have actually been obtained if the merger occurred as of January 1, 2005, nor does the pro forma data intend to be a projection of results that may be obtained in the future.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
