Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Attached as an exhibit hereto is a press release and financial tables dated August 1, 2006 issued by Verizon Communications Inc.
Non-GAAP Measures
Verizon's press release and financial tables include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.
The consolidated statements of income before special items eliminate special items and non-recurring items of revenues, expenses, gains and losses primarily as a result of their non-operational and/or non-recurring nature. This also includes current and prior periods' operating revenues and operating expenses of significant operations sold, including Verizon's Hawaii wireline and directory operations which were sold during the second quarter of 2005. Management believes this presentation of operating performance assists readers in better understanding our results of operations and trends from period to period, consistent with management's evaluation of Verizon's consolidated and segment results of operations for a variety of internal measures including strategic business planning, capital allocation and compensation. Management believes that the consolidated statements of income before special items provide current and prior period results of operations on a comparable basis as well as provide trends that are more indicative of future operating results than GAAP results of operations, given the non-operational and/or non-recurring nature of the special items removed for purposes of reporting results of operations before special items. While some of these items have been periodically reported in Verizon's consolidated results of operations, their occurrence in future periods is dependent upon future business and economic factors, among other evaluation criteria, and may frequently be beyond the control of management. As a result of these factors, management also provides this information externally, along with a complete reconciliation to their comparable GAAP amounts so readers have access to the detail and general nature of adjustments made to GAAP results. Descriptions of the special items are provided in the schedules accompanying the press release.
Management believes that Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer and Verizon Wireless's operating income before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and EBITDA margin, additional non-GAAP financial measures, are also useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating financial performance. Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer is determined by subtracting equipment and other revenue from Verizon Wireless's cost of sales and services and selling, general and administrative expenses, divided by average customers during the period. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA is determined by adding-back depreciation and amortization to operating income and the Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Verizon Wireless's EBITDA by Verizon Wireless's service revenues. Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer, EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP operating performance measures that are used internally to evaluate current operating expense efficiency and operating profitability on a more variable cost basis by excluding the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions (particularly customer base amortization) that occurred in prior years. Cash expense per customer is determined by reflecting equipment and other revenue on a net cost basis in order to illustrate the impact of the net cost of selling handsets and other equipment to the customers and other similar transactions with customers. In addition, Verizon management uses this information to evaluate operating performance in relation to Verizon Wireless's competitors. The Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin utilizes service revenues rather than total revenues. Service revenues exclude primarily equipment revenues (as well as other non-service revenues) in order to capture the impact of providing service to the wireless customer base on an ongoing basis. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA margin is presented along with Verizon Wireless's operating income margin so as not to imply more emphasis should be placed on it than the corresponding GAAP measure. Management believes this presentation assists readers in preparing comparisons of this type of performance measure (operating profitability) using the GAAP measure as well as the measure segment management uses to evaluate segment results and perform comparisons to other wireless carriers.
The pro forma financial information presents the combined operating results of Verizon and the former MCI on a comparable basis, before special items. Management believes this presentation of pro forma financial information before special items assists readers in better understanding our results of operations and trends from period to period, consistent with management's evaluation of Verizon's consolidated and segment results of operations for a variety of internal measures. Management believes that the pro forma financial information provides current and prior period results of operations on a comparable basis and provides trends that are more indicative of future operating results than GAAP results of operations, given the merger during the period and the non-operational and/or non-recurring nature of the special items removed for purposes of reporting results of operations before special items. Management believes that the combined and Wireline pro forma cash expense information, additional non-GAAP financial measures, are also useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating financial performance. Cash expense is determined by subtracting depreciation and amortization expense from operating expenses before special items. Combined pro forma cash expense and Wireline pro forma cash expense are non-GAAP operating performance measures that are used internally to evaluate current operating expense efficiency on a more variable cost basis. Management provides this information externally, along with a complete reconciliation to their comparable GAAP amounts so readers have access to the detail and general nature of adjustments made to GAAP results. Descriptions of these pro forma items are provided in the schedules accompanying the press release.
It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance understanding of Verizon's GAAP consolidated financial statements and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

Notes: Reclassifications of prior-period amounts have been made to reflect comparable results excluding Verizon's Hawaii wireline and directory operations, which were sold in the second quarter 2005. See the schedules accompanying this news release and www.verizon.com/investor for reconciliations to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the non-GAAP financial measures included in this announcement.
Maintaining industry-leading growth in wireless and broadband markets, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) today reported continued strong financial and operational results for the second quarter 2006.
NEW YORK 
Verizon reported quarterly earnings of $1.6 billion, or 55 cents per diluted share, compared with $2.1 billion, or 75 cents per share, in the second quarter 2005.
Reported earnings in the second quarter 2006 reflect 9 cents per share in special items for severance and related pension and benefits charges, and for employee relocations and merger integration costs. Reported earnings in the second quarter 2005 had included a net of 12 cents per share in non-recurring gains, principally from the sale of Verizon's wireline and directory operations in Hawaii.
Before special items (non-GAAP), Verizon's earnings were 64 cents per share in the second quarter 2006, compared with 63 cents in the second quarter 2005.
For the full year, Verizon has reiterated guidance of 2006 EPS similar to 2005 earnings of $2.56 per share before special items.
Consolidated operating revenues in the second quarter 2006 were $22.7 billion, a 25.6 percent increase compared with the second quarter 2005. Consolidated total operating expenses were $19.1 billion, a 35.7 percent increase compared with the second quarter 2005. Reported results in the second quarter 2006 include revenues and expenses from the former MCI, Inc., which merged with Verizon on Jan. 6, 2006.
Verizon News Release, page 3
On a pro-forma (non-GAAP) basis, comparing second quarter 2006 with second quarter 2005, adjusted operating revenues increased 2.3 percent, adjusted cash expenses increased 1.0 percent and adjusted operating income increased 12.4 percent. Adjusted operating income margins, including the effects of net pension and OPEB (other post-retirement benefits), would have been 17.7 percent in second quarter 2006, compared with 16.1 percent in second quarter 2005. Pro-forma adjusted information presents the combined operating results of Verizon and the former MCI on a comparable basis.
"Our second-quarter results are strong, and we are gaining momentum as we focus on growth initiatives and creating shareholder value," said Ivan Seidenberg, Verizon chairman and CEO. "We have maintained excellent cost management across our network-based wireless, broadband and enterprise businesses, and we are confident in our ability to grow earnings."
He continued: "Verizon Wireless produced another industry-leading quarter of profitable growth. The sustainability of the company's market leadership is due to our network reliability, handset and services innovation, and exceptional customer loyalty.
"In our wireline business, we continue to see strong demand for broadband services. Verizon Telecom is tightly controlling costs in traditional businesses as we make the fiber network investments to accelerate growth and market expansion. At Verizon Business, we're off to an aggressive start. Using the Verizon model of network strength, product and service innovation, and quality customer service, we already see revenue trends improving, coupled with declining costs.
"As our strategic initiatives are proceeding on target, we are continuing our share repurchase program in another sign of our confidence."
Verizon News Release, page 4
Verizon Wireless again generated industry-leading net customer additions and profitability in the second quarter 2006, and again set new all-time low churn records among the major carriers.
This was the 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit, year-over-year revenue growth. This was the sixth consecutive quarter with EBITDA margins above 40 percent, the ninth consecutive quarter in which the company added more than 1.5 million total customers and the eighth consecutive quarter in which it added more than 1.5 million retail customers.
Verizon Wireless added 1.8 million net customers in the second quarter 2006, for a total of 54.8 million customers nationwide, representing a 15.8 percent increase in total customers from the end of the second quarter last year. During the past 12 months, the company added nearly 7.5 million net customers, more than any other carrier in the industry.
All of the net additions in the quarter and almost all of those in the past 12 months were retail customers  that is, businesses and consumers directly served and managed by Verizon Wireless and who buy Verizon Wireless-branded service, rather than customers of the company's resellers.
Verizon Wireless continued to set new industry records for low customer churn, a key measure of customer loyalty. For the second quarter 2006, total churn was a record-low 1.13 percent, and churn among the company's retail postpaid customers was 0.87 percent, another record.
Verizon Wireless revenues grew 18.0 percent year-over-year to $9.3 billion in the second quarter 2006, driven by continued strong customer growth and demand for data services. Topping $1.0 billion for the first time in a quarter, wireless data revenues accounted for nearly 12.9 percent of total wireless service revenues.
Verizon News Release, page 5
Verizon Wireless operating income margin was 25.6 percent in the quarter, reflecting its ability to maintain industry-leading cost efficiency even as it added the most retail customers.
Wireless EBITDA margin was 44.4 percent. (EBITDA  or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization  is a non-GAAP measure that adds depreciation and amortization to operating income; EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing EBITDA by wireless service revenues.)
In the second quarter, Verizon's wireline business added 440,000 net broadband connections, which include both DSL and FiOS, Verizon's next-generation, fiber-optic-based service. Over the past three quarters, Verizon has added 1.6 million net new DSL and FiOS customers, more than any other company offering broadband services in the United States for that period.
FiOS Internet customers accounted for 111,000 of the net broadband connection additions in the second quarter 2006 and now make up 375,000 of the company's 6.1 million total wireline broadband connections, which have increased 47.9 percent compared with the second quarter 2005. FiOS data services are becoming increasingly available for sale in 16 states, as Verizon's FTTP (fiber to the premises) network passed a total of 4.5 million premises by mid-July 2006 and is on target to pass 6 million premises by year-end.
Penetration of FiOS Internet services now stands at 12 percent across all markets. In markets where Verizon has been selling FiOS data services for at least a year, the average penetration rate was 15 percent at the one-year mark, well on the way toward achieving the company's goal
Verizon News Release, page 6
of 30 percent penetration in five years. Earnings dilution from FiOS data and video deployment was 7 cents per share in the second quarter 2006 and is expected in the range of 28 cents per share to 30 cents per share for the full year.
Total wireline operating revenues were $12.8 billion in the second quarter 2006, an increase of 35.3 percent compared with the second quarter 2005 on an adjusted basis (non-GAAP) excluding revenues from operations sold in 2005. On the same adjusted basis, total wireline operating expenses were $11.6 billion in the second quarter 2006, a 40.1 percent increase compared with the second quarter 2005.
On a pro-forma basis, wireline operating revenues decreased 6.2 percent comparing second quarter 2006 with second quarter 2005, driven in part by expected declines in the former MCI mass market business. Also on a pro-forma basis, wireline cash expenses (total operating expenses less depreciation and amortization expense) of $9.1 billion in the second quarter 2006 decreased 6.7 percent compared with the second quarter 2005.
Verizon Business, which provides advanced communications and information technology solutions to large business and government customers globally, steadily built momentum during the second quarter.
Verizon Business experienced improving revenue trends in the quarter. The business remains ahead of plan to achieve its 2006 target of $550 million in synergies from the MCI merger. By the end of the second quarter, approximately $200 million in synergies were realized, at a rate that will continue to ramp up through the remainder of the year.
Compared with the first quarter 2006, Verizon Business operating revenues increased 1.6 percent, on a pro-forma basis, to $5.1 billion in the second quarter 2006. Over the same period, pro-forma revenues from strategic growth products  including a variety of IP (Internet protocol) and managed network services  rose 5.4 percent, to $938 million.
Verizon News Release, page 7
Verizon Business continued to deliver on the success of its January 2006 launch, unveiling additional products and services that meet customers' advanced communications and information technology needs. As the business communications market continued its shift to IP technology, Verizon Business moved to further enhance its industry-leading VoIP (voice over IP) product portfolio, rolling out new offerings such as a VoIP security assessment service in the U.S. and extending VoIP capabilities to international markets.
At the consolidated level, Cash Flows from Operating Activities were $11.5 billion in the first half of 2006, compared with $9.9 billion in the first half of 2005. Capital expenditures were $8.3 billion in the first half of 2006, including a nearly $1.0 billion increase in wireline investment primarily driven by the inclusion of MCI, compared with $7.5 billion in 2005.
In the first half of the year, Verizon repurchased $1.0 billion in shares, meeting its previously stated full-year target. The company plans to continue its share buyback program in 2006, and it is targeting an additional $500 million in repurchases in the second half.
Verizon's total debt at the end of the second quarter 2006 was $42.4 billion, compared with $38.3 billion at the end of 2005. The increase was primarily due to the addition of MCI's debt as a result of the merger.
Special items in the second quarter 2006 included $186 million in after-tax charges, or 6 cents per share, for severance and related charges for 3,200 employees, primarily in the company's wireline business, who will leave Verizon before the end of the year. At the end of the second quarter, Verizon had more than 252,000 employees  essentially flat with the first-quarter total, as job growth in wireless balanced declines in other areas of the business.
Verizon News Release, page 8
Other special items were $48 million after-tax, or 2 cents per share, for MCI merger integration costs, and $29 million after-tax, or 1 cent per share, for relocation and other costs related to the Verizon Center in New Jersey.
In April 2006, Verizon announced that definitive agreements were reached to sell its interests in Verizon Dominicana, Telecomunicaciones de Puerto Rico and Compaia Annima Nacional Telfonos de Venezuela. Verizon Dominicana and Telecomunicaciones de Puerto Rico are now reported as discontinued operations.
Following are second-quarter 2006 highlights for Verizon's Wireless, Wireline and Information Services business segments.

Information Services:
In December 2005, Verizon announced that it is exploring divesting Verizon Information Services (VIS) through a spinoff, sale or other strategic transaction. In July 2006, Verizon
Verizon News Release, page 12
announced the filing of a Form 10 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in a step toward a proposed spinoff of Verizon's domestic print and Internet yellow pages directories to its stockholders. Verizon has not yet made a final decision whether a spinoff will occur, but the company continues to expect to complete a disposition of these operations  which could include the spinoff, a sale or other transaction, or combination of these alternatives  by the end of 2006. Since this process is still ongoing, VIS' results of operations, financial position and cash flows remain in continuing operations.
