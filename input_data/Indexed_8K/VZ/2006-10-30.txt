Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Attached as an exhibit hereto is a press release and financial tables dated October 30, 2006 issued by Verizon Communications Inc.
Non-GAAP Measures
Verizon's press release and financial tables include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.
The consolidated statements of income before special items eliminate special items and non-recurring items of revenues, expenses, gains and losses primarily as a result of their non-operational and/or non-recurring nature. This also includes current and prior periods' operating revenues and operating expenses of significant operations sold, including Verizon's Hawaii wireline and directory operations which were sold during the second quarter of 2005. Management believes this presentation of operating performance assists readers in better understanding our results of operations and trends from period to period, consistent with management's evaluation of Verizon's consolidated and segment results of operations for a variety of internal measures including strategic business planning, capital allocation and compensation. Management believes that the consolidated statements of income before special items provide current and prior period results of operations on a comparable basis as well as provide trends that are more indicative of future operating results than GAAP results of operations, given the non-operational and/or non-recurring nature of the special items removed for purposes of reporting results of operations before special items. While some of these items have been periodically reported in Verizon's consolidated results of operations, their occurrence in future periods is dependent upon future business and economic factors, among other evaluation criteria, and may frequently be beyond the control of management. As a result of these factors, management also provides this information externally, along with a complete reconciliation to their comparable GAAP amounts so readers have access to the detail and general nature of adjustments made to GAAP results. Descriptions of the special items are provided in the schedules accompanying the press release.
Management believes that Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer and Verizon Wireless's operating income before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and EBITDA margin, additional non-GAAP financial measures, are also useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating financial performance. Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer is determined by subtracting equipment and other revenue from Verizon Wireless's cost of sales and services and selling, general and administrative expenses, divided by average customers during the period. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA is determined by adding-back depreciation and amortization to operating income and the Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Verizon Wireless's EBITDA by Verizon Wireless's service revenues. Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer, EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP operating performance measures that are used internally to evaluate current operating expense efficiency and operating profitability on a more variable cost basis by excluding the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions (particularly customer base amortization) that occurred in prior years. Cash expense per customer is determined by reflecting equipment and other revenue on a net cost basis in order to illustrate the impact of the net cost of selling handsets and other equipment to the customers and other similar transactions with customers. In addition, Verizon management uses this information to evaluate operating performance in relation to Verizon Wireless's competitors. The Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin utilizes service revenues rather than total revenues. Service revenues exclude primarily equipment revenues (as well as other non-service revenues) in order to capture the impact of providing service to the wireless customer base on an ongoing basis. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA margin is presented along with Verizon Wireless's operating income margin so as not to imply more emphasis should be placed on it than the corresponding GAAP measure. Management believes this presentation assists readers in preparing comparisons of this type of performance measure (operating profitability) using the GAAP measure as well as the measure segment management uses to evaluate segment results and perform comparisons to other wireless carriers.
The pro forma financial information presents the combined operating results of Verizon and the former MCI on a comparable basis, before special items. Management believes this presentation of pro forma financial information before special items assists readers in better understanding our results of operations and trends from period to period, consistent with management's evaluation of Verizon's consolidated and segment results of operations for a variety of internal measures. Management believes that the pro forma financial information provides current and prior period results of operations on a comparable basis and provides trends that are more indicative of future operating results than GAAP results of operations, given the merger during the period and the non-operational and/or non-recurring nature of the special items removed for purposes of reporting results of operations before
special items. Management believes that the combined and Wireline pro forma cash expense information, additional non-GAAP financial measures, are also useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating financial performance. Cash expense is determined by subtracting depreciation and amortization expense from operating expenses before special items. Combined pro forma cash expense and Wireline pro forma cash expense are non-GAAP operating performance measures that are used internally to evaluate current operating expense efficiency on a more variable cost basis. Management provides this information externally, along with a complete reconciliation to their comparable GAAP amounts so readers have access to the detail and general nature of adjustments made to GAAP results. Descriptions of these pro forma items are provided in the schedules accompanying the press release.
It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance understanding of Verizon's GAAP consolidated financial statements and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

Notes: Prior-period amounts have been reclassified to reflect comparable results. See the schedules accompanying this news release and www.verizon.com/investor for reconciliations to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the non-GAAP financial measures included in this announcement. Verizon's 2006 reported results include revenues and expenses from the former MCI, Inc., which merged with Verizon in January 2006. Discontinued operations include the operations of Verizon Dominicana C. por A. and Telecomunicaciones de Puerto Rico Inc. foll

quarter 2006 agreements to sell the businesses.
Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) today reported strong financial and operational results for the third quarter 2006, as sales volumes gained momentum in wireless, broadband and enterprise markets.
NEW YORK 
Verizon reported quarterly earnings of $1.9 billion, or 66 cents per diluted share, compared with $1.9 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the third quarter 2005.
Reported earnings in the third quarter 2006 include a charge of 2 cents per share for special items, including pension settlement charges and Verizon Center relocation and merger integration costs. Reported earnings in the third quarter 2005 had included a net gain of 1 cent per share in special items, principally from gains on a real estate sale and tax benefits, partially offset by asset impairments. In the third quarter 2006, Verizon recognized an $85 million favorable tax benefit at Vodafone Omnitel.
Before special items (non-GAAP), Verizon's third-quarter 2006 earnings were $2.0 billion, or 68 cents per share. This is an increase of 7.5 percent compared with earnings of $1.8 billion, or 66 cents per share, in the third quarter 2005.
Consolidated third-quarter 2006 operating revenues were $23.3 billion, a 25.8 percent increase compared with the third quarter 2005. Consolidated total operating expenses were $19.3 billion, a 29.0 percent increase compared with the third quarter 2005. Verizon's third-quarter 2006 reported results include revenues and expenses from the former MCI.
Verizon News Release, page 3
Comparing third quarter 2006 with third quarter 2005 on a pro-forma (non-GAAP) basis:
 
 
 
Adjusted operating income margins, including the effects of net pension and OPEB (other post-retirement benefits) costs, were 17.3 percent in third quarter 2006, compared with 16.8 percent in third quarter 2005. Pro-forma, adjusted information presents the combined operating results of Verizon and the former MCI on a comparable basis.
"Verizon continues to win customers and market share for wireless, broadband and enterprise services," said Ivan Seidenberg, Verizon chairman and CEO. "These organic growth initiatives gained momentum in the third quarter, and we are confident this growth is sustainable. We are building long-term shareholder value on a foundation of infrastructure and technology investment, supported by innovative marketing and customer service initiatives.
"Once again, Verizon Wireless has posted another industry-leading quarter of profitable growth, while our other network-based businesses continue to establish new customer relationships. Verizon Telecom reported an excellent quarter in adding broadband and video customers. Verizon Business again delivered sequential revenue growth as it focuses on increasing its penetration of U.S.-based multi-national accounts, and the integration of the former MCI is producing significant operational benefits and synergies that are on plan."
Verizon News Release, page 4
Seidenberg added, "We are maintaining strong consolidated cash flows that we have used in part to continue our share repurchase program in the third quarter."
Verizon Wireless again delivered strong revenue growth, profitability, net customer additions and low churn that were significantly ahead of the industry.
Verizon Wireless is now the largest U.S. wireless carrier in terms of revenue. The company is also the largest wireless data provider based on data revenue, and it has the most retail customers  that is, businesses and consumers directly served by Verizon Wireless and who buy Verizon Wireless-branded service, rather than customers of the company's resellers.
Verizon Wireless revenues grew 18.2 percent year-over-year to $9.9 billion in the third quarter 2006, driven by strong customer growth and demand for data services. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of 18 percent or better revenue growth. Service ARPU (average revenue per user) increased year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter, and wireless data revenues grew to 14.1 percent of total wireless service revenues.
Verizon Wireless operating income margin was 26.2 percent in the quarter, its highest level ever, reflecting the company's ability to improve its industry-leading cost efficiency even as it added the most retail customers.
Wireless EBITDA margin was 45.0 percent. (EBITDA  or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization  is a non-GAAP measure that adds depreciation and amortization to operating income; EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing EBITDA by wireless service revenues.)
Verizon News Release, page 5
Verizon Wireless added 1.9 million net customers in the third quarter 2006, for a total of 56.7 million customers nationwide, a 15.1 percent increase in total customers from the end of the third quarter last year. During the past 12 months, the company has added nearly 7.5 million net customers, more than any other wireless carrier. All of the net additions in the third quarter and almost all net additions in the past 12 months were retail customers.
Key to the company's strong net add performance was its continued industry-leading low churn level. For the third quarter 2006, total churn was 1.24 percent, and churn among the company's retail postpaid customers  93 percent of all its customers  was 0.95 percent.
Verizon Telecom, which serves wireline residential and small-business customers, added 448,000 net broadband connections in the third quarter 2006. These results include new customers of both DSL and FiOS fiber-optic-based Internet access services. Over the past year, Verizon Telecom has added more than 2 million net new DSL and FiOS Internet customers. Verizon Telecom now has 6.6 million total broadband connections, an increase of 45.1 percent compared with the third quarter 2005.
FiOS Internet customers accounted for 147,000 of the net broadband connection additions in the third quarter and now total 522,000. In addition, Verizon Telecom had 118,000 FiOS TV customers at the end of the third quarter.
In the consumer market, Verizon added 120,000 more net broadband and video customers during the third quarter than it lost in primary wireline voice access lines. New broadband and video sales have more than made up for a reduction in primary wireline voice access lines of customers who turned to wireless, cable or Internet protocol (IP) services. Primary residential access lines decreased by 419,000 in the third quarter 2006, compared with the second quarter 2006, while Verizon added 539,000 residential broadband and video customers, including customers with DIRECTV bundles, over the same period.
Verizon News Release, page 6
At the end of the third quarter 2006, there were 46.0 million total domestic wireline access lines  which also include secondary residential lines, public telephones, business lines and wholesale voice connections. This represents a 7.5 percent decrease compared with the end of the third quarter 2005.
Total wireline operating revenues, including Verizon Business, were $12.8 billion in the third quarter 2006, an increase of 35.5 percent compared with the third quarter 2005. On an adjusted basis (non-GAAP), total wireline operating expenses were $11.7 billion in the third quarter 2006, a 43.3 percent increase compared with the third quarter 2005.
On a pro-forma basis, wireline operating revenues decreased 4.7 percent, comparing third quarter 2006 with third quarter 2005, driven in part by a continuation of the expected declines in former MCI operations serving mass market (residential and small business) customers. Wireline revenues were up sequentially for the second quarter in a row, with third quarter 2006 revenues up 0.1 percent over second quarter 2006.
Also on a pro-forma basis, wireline cash expenses (total operating expenses less depreciation and amortization expense) were $9.3 billion in the third quarter 2006, a decrease of 1.3 percent compared with the third quarter 2005.
Verizon Business, which provides advanced communications and information technology solutions to large business and government customers globally, continued to build momentum during the third quarter.
Verizon News Release, page 7
Compared with the second quarter 2006, Verizon Business operating revenues increased 1.7 percent to $5.2 billion in the third quarter 2006. Pro-forma revenues from key strategic services, such as IP and managed services, grew nearly 25 percent in the third quarter 2006, compared with the third quarter 2005.
During the third quarter 2006, Verizon Business realized approximately $150 million in incremental synergies from the integration of the former MCI. This brings the year-to-date total to approximately $350 million  on track with the company's year-end target of $550 million.
Verizon Business once again introduced a series of new products and capabilities for its large business and government customers, and delivered a strong quarterly performance. New offerings during the quarter included expansion of Ethernet access to the Verizon Business Private IP network in six additional European countries and the addition of new IP-based capabilities for its Contact Center Services and VoIP (voice over Internet protocol) portfolio to help businesses enhance customer-service operations and leverage the benefits of VoIP. Verizon Business also unveiled a new unified operations and security center for its federal government customers.
At the consolidated level, cash flows from continuing operations were $17.9 billion in the first nine months of 2006, compared with $15.0 billion in the first nine months of 2005. Capital expenditures from continuing operations were $12.3 billion in the first nine months of 2006, including a $1.1 billion increase in wireline investment primarily driven by the inclusion of MCI, compared with $11.4 billion over the same period in 2005. Verizon continues to maintain its guidance for full-year 2006 capital expenditures of $17.0 billion to $17.4 billion.
Verizon News Release, page 8
In the third quarter, Verizon repurchased approximately $350 million in shares, bringing total share repurchases to $1.35 billion over the first nine months of 2006, toward a previously announced target of $1.5 billion by year-end.
Verizon's total debt at the end of the third quarter 2006 was $41.7 billion, compared with $42.4 billion at the end of the second quarter 2006.
Special items in the third quarter 2006 included $64 million in after-tax charges, or 2 cents per share, for pension settlement charges, MCI merger integration costs, and relocation and other costs related to establishing the Verizon Center in New Jersey. Special items in the third quarter 2005 included a net gain of 1 cent per share on the sale of a New York City office building and related relocation costs, tax benefits, asset impairments and other costs.
The recently issued Financial Accounting Standard, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (FAS 158), will be effective at year-end 2006 and requires the recognition of the funded status of defined benefits plans as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet. Based on Verizon's current estimates, the company expects to decrease shareowners' equity by approximately $10 billion post-tax as a result of adopting this change. There is no impact on cash flows or earnings as a result of adopting this change.
Earlier this month, Verizon announced that its Board of Directors had approved the proposed spin-off of Information Services to its stockholders. The spin-off is expected to close on or about Nov. 17, resulting in a new public company called Idearc Inc.
As a result of the spin-off, Verizon is expected to reduce its outstanding indebtedness by approximately $7 billion through a debt-for-debt exchange as described in the Form 10
Verizon News Release, page 9
Registration Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Verizon is also expected to receive approximately $2 billion in cash proceeds from additional borrowings by Idearc in connection with the spin-off.
In April 2006, Verizon announced the execution of definitive agreements to sell its interests in Verizon Dominicana, Telecomunicaciones de Puerto Rico and Compaia Annima Nacional Telfonos de Venezuela. These asset sales are proceeding, and Verizon Dominicana and Telecomunicaciones de Puerto Rico are reported as discontinued operations.
Following are third-quarter 2006 highlights for Verizon's Wireless, Wireline and Information Services business segments.
