Item 1.01 Entry into Material Definitive Agreements
On November 17, 2006 (the "Distribution Date"), Verizon Communications Inc. ("Verizon") spun off the companies that comprised its domestic print and Internet yellow pages directories publishing operations. In connection with the spin-off, Verizon transferred to Idearc Inc. ("Idearc") all of its ownership interest in Idearc Information Services LLC and other assets, liabilities, businesses and employees primarily related to Verizon's domestic print and Internet yellow pages directories publishing operations (the "Contribution"). The spin-off was completed by making a pro rata distribution to Verizon's shareholders of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Idearc.
In connection with the spin-off, on the Distribution Date, and in consideration for the Contribution, Idearc (1) issued to Verizon additional shares of Idearc common stock, (2) issued to Verizon $2.85 billion aggregate principal amount of Idearc's 8% senior notes due 2016 and $4.3 billion aggregate principal amount of loans under Idearc's tranche B term loan facility (collectively, the "Idearc Debt Obligations") and (3) transferred to Verizon approximately $2.4 billion in cash from cash on hand, from the proceeds of loans under Idearc's tranche A term loan facility and from the proceeds of the remaining portion of the loans under Idearc's tranche B term loan facility.
In addition, in connection with the spin-off, Verizon entered into the agreements described below.
Distribution Agreement
On November 13, 2006, Verizon entered into a distribution agreement with Idearc, which contains the key provisions relating to the separation of Idearc from Verizon and the distribution of Idearc common stock. The distribution agreement identifies the assets to be transferred, liabilities to be assumed and contracts to be assigned to Idearc by Verizon and by Idearc to Verizon in the separation and describes when and how these transfers, assumptions and assignments occur. The Contribution is made on an "as is," "where is" basis without any representations or warranties, and Idearc bears the economic and legal risks that the conveyance is insufficient to vest good and marketable title, free and clear of any lien or other security interest, that any necessary consents or approval were not obtained, and that requirements of laws or judgments were not complied with. A copy of the distribution agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference into this Item 1.01.
Exchange Agreements
On November 13, 2006, Verizon entered into (1) an Exchange Agreement with Idearc (with respect to certain sections thereof) and J.P. Morgan Ventures Corporation and (2) an Exchange Agreement with Idearc (with respect to certain sections thereof) and

Procedures for Indemnification for Third-Party Claims
(a) Verizon shall, and shall cause the other Verizon Indemnitees to, notify Spinco in writing promptly after learning of any Third-Party Claim for which any Verizon Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification from Spinco under this Agreement. Spinco shall, and shall cause the other Spinco Indemnitees to, notify Verizon in writing promptly after learning of any Third-Party Claim for which any Spinco Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification from Verizon under this Agreement. The failure of any Indemnitee to give such notice shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Article V except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. Such notice shall describe such Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail considering the Information provided to the Indemnitee and shall indicate the amount (estimated if necessary) of the Indemnifiable Loss that has been claimed against or may be sustained by such Indemnitee.
 
(b) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this Section 5.3, an Indemnifying Party may, by notice to the Indemnitee and to Verizon, if Spinco is the Indemnifying Party, or to the Indemnitee and Spinco, if Verizon is the Indemnifying Party, within thirty (30) days after receipt by such Indemnifying Party of such Indemnitee's notice of a Third-Party Claim, undertake (itself or through another member of the Group of which the Indemnifying Party is a member) the defense or settlement of such Third-Party Claim, at such Indemnifying Party's own expense and by counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee. If an Indemnifying Party undertakes the defense of any Third-Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party shall control the investigation and defense or settlement thereof, and the Indemnitee may not settle or compromise such Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, except that such Indemnifying Party shall not () require any Indemnitee, without its prior written consent, to take or refrain from taking any action in connection with such Third-Party Claim, or make any public statement, which such Indemnitee reasonably considers to be against its interests, or () without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee and of Verizon, if the Indemnitee is a Verizon Indemnitee, or the Indemnitee and of Spinco, if the Indemnitee is a Spinco Indemnitee, consent to any settlement that does not include as a part thereof an unconditional release of the relevant Indemnitees from liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim or that requires the Indemnitee or any of its Representatives or Affiliates to make any payment that is not fully indemnified under this Agreement or to be subject to any non-monetary remedy. Subject to the Indemnifying Party's control rights, as specified herein, the Indemnitees may participate in such investigation and defense, at their own expense. Following the provision of notices to the Indemnifying Party, until such time as an Indemnifying Party has undertaken the defense of any Third-Party Claim as provided herein, such Indemnitee shall control the investigation and defense or settlement thereof, without prejudice to its right to seek indemnification hereunder.
i
ii
(c) If an Indemnitee reasonably determines that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to its Indemnifying Party which make it inappropriate for the Indemnifying Party to undertake the defense or settlement thereof, then such Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to undertake the defense or settlement of such Third-Party Claim; and counsel for the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to conduct the defense of such Indemnifying Party and counsel for the Indemnitee (selected by the Indemnitee) shall be entitled to conduct the defense of such Indemnitee, in which case the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnitee (but not more than one such counsel (in addition to local counsel, if any) reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party) shall be paid by such Indemnifying Party, it being understood that both such counsel shall cooperate with each other to conduct the defense or settlement of such action as efficiently as possible.
(d) In no event shall an Indemnifying Party be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all Indemnitees (in addition to local counsel and its own
 
counsel, if any) in connection with any one action, or separate but similar or related actions, in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances; provided, however, (i) if the Indemnitees are individuals, (ii) the claims for which they are seeking indemnification are covered under the Indemnifying Party's directors and officers liability policy, and (iii) the Indemnifying Party's insurance carrier has agreed to pay fees and expenses for multiple counsel, then the Indemnifying Party shall pay such fees and expenses.
(e) If the Indemnifying Party undertakes the defense or settlement of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall make available to the Indemnifying Party and its counsel all information and documents reasonably available to it which relate to such Third-Party Claim, and otherwise cooperate as may reasonably be required in connection with the investigation, defense and settlement thereof, subject to the terms and conditions of a mutually acceptable joint defense agreement.
Section 5.5 . The amount that any Indemnifying Party is or may be required to pay to any Indemnitee pursuant to this Article V shall be reduced (retroactively or prospectively) by () any insurance proceeds or other amounts actually recovered from third parties by or on behalf of such Indemnitee in respect of the related Indemnifiable Losses (net of all costs of recovery, including deductibles, co-payments or other payment obligations) and () any tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnitee in respect of the related Indemnifiable Losses. The existence of a claim by an Indemnitee for insurance or against a third party in respect of any Indemnifiable Loss or the availability of potential tax benefits shall not, however, delay or reduce any payment pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained herein and otherwise determined to be due and owing by an Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall make payment in full of such amount so determined to be due and owing by it and, if, and to the extent that, there exists a claim against any third party (other than an insurer) in respect of such Indemnifiable Loss, the Indemnitee shall assign such claim against such third party to the Indemnifying Party. Any tax benefit actually received by an Indemnified Party shall be paid over to the Indemnifying Party to the extent such tax benefit relates to an Indemnifiable Loss for which indemnification has already been received. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, it is the intention of the Parties hereto that no insurer or any other third party shall be () entitled to a benefit it would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the foregoing indemnification provisions or () relieved of the responsibility to pay any claims for which it is obligated. If an Indemnitee shall have received the payment required by this Agreement from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Indemnifiable Losses and shall subsequently actually receive insurance proceeds, tax benefits or other amounts in respect of such Indemnifiable Losses, then such Indemnitee shall hold such insurance proceeds in trust for the benefit of such Indemnifying Party and shall promptly pay to such Indemnifying Party a sum equal to the amount of such insurance proceeds, tax benefits or other amounts actually received, up to the aggregate amount of any payments received from such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement in respect of such Indemnifiable Losses.

Contribution
(a) If the indemnification provided for in this Article V is unavailable to, or insufficient to hold harmless, any Indemnitee in respect of any Losses for which indemnification is provided for herein, then the relevant Indemnifying Party shall contribute to the Losses for which such indemnification is unavailable or insufficient in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and such Indemnitee in connection with the circumstances which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
(b) The relative fault of Verizon and Spinco shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the Parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission and, in the case of any Losses arising out of or due to any of the matters described in Section 5.3(a)(ii) or Section 5.3(b)(ii), whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by Verizon or by Spinco.
(c) Verizon and Spinco agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5.6 were determined by any method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 5.6(b). The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an Indemnitee and referred to in Section 5.3(a) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Section 5.7 . In no event shall an Indemnifying Party be liable for any Indemnitee's special, punitive, exemplary, incidental, consequential or indirect damages, or lost profits, whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other law or otherwise.
Consequential Damages
Section 5.8 . With respect to any Third Party Claim in which both Verizon and Spinco are, or reasonably may be expected to be, named as parties, or that otherwise implicates both Verizon and Spinco to a material degree, the Parties shall reasonably cooperate with respect to such Third Party Claim and maintain a joint defense in a manner that will preserve applicable privileges.

No such terminated contract, license, agreement, commitment or other arrangement (including any provision thereof that purports to survive termination) shall be of any further force or effect after the Distribution Date and all parties thereto shall be released from all obligations thereunder.

Exhibit 99.1
NEWS RELEASE
 
On Monday, Nov. 20, Idearc Inc. common stock will begin trading in the regular way market on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol "IAR."
NEW YORK 
The previously announced spin-off of Idearc to shareholders of Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) was completed today, and Idearc now owns what were the Verizon domestic print and Internet yellow pages directories publishing operations. Verizon distributed a dividend of one share of Idearc common stock for every 20 shares of Verizon common stock held as of 5 p.m. on Nov. 1 (the "Idearc Stock Dividend").
Beginning Nov. 6 and continuing through the close of business today, there have been two markets in Verizon common stock: a "regular way" market (which includes the Idearc Stock Dividend) and an "ex-distribution" market (which does not include the Idearc Stock Dividend).
Verizon has been advised by the NYSE that regular way trading under the symbol "VZ" includes the Idearc Stock Dividend through the close of business today. This means that a purchaser who buys shares of Verizon common stock in the regular way market under the symbol "VZ" through the close of business today will also buy the right to receive the Idearc Stock Dividend associated with those Verizon shares. Similarly, when-issued trading in Idearc common stock under the symbol "IAR wi" will continue on the NYSE through the close of business today.
Beginning on Nov. 20, Verizon common stock trading under the symbol "VZ" will no longer include the Idearc Stock Dividend.
For further information, see Idearc's Form 10 Registration Statement, as amended, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available online at .
