Item 8.01 Other Events.
On November 17, 2006, Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon) completed the previously announced spin-off of Idearc Inc. (Idearc) to shareholders of Verizon. Idearc now owns what was the Verizon domestic print and Internet yellow pages directories publishing operations, which had been the principal component of our Information Services segment. Accordingly, the Information Services segment is now classified as discontinued operations. As a convenience to investors who may want to consider the effects of this transaction, we are making available historical consolidated financial information for the last eleven quarters showing the revised discontinued operations presentation. This revised financial information is provided as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 hereto. Discontinued operations now includes our former Information Services segment, as well as our interests in Verizon Dominicana C. por A. (Verizon Dominicana) and Telecomunicaciones de Puerto Rico, Inc. (TELPRI), which were classified as discontinued operations in April 2006 concurrent with our entering into definitive agreements to sell our interests in separate transactions to Amrica Mvil, S.A. de C.V. (Amrica Mvil). The sale of Verizon Dominicana closed during the fourth quarter of 2006.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
