Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Attached as an exhibit hereto is a press release and financial tables dated January 29, 2007 issued by Verizon Communications Inc.
Non-GAAP Measures
Verizon's press release and financial tables include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.
The consolidated statements of income before special items eliminate special items and non-recurring items of revenues, expenses, gains and losses primarily as a result of their non-operational and/or non-recurring nature. This also includes current and prior periods' operating revenues and operating expenses of significant operations sold, including Verizon's Hawaii wireline operations which were sold during the second quarter of 2005. Management believes this presentation of operating performance assists readers in better understanding our results of operations and trends from period to period, consistent with management's evaluation of Verizon's consolidated and segment results of operations for a variety of internal measures including strategic business planning, capital allocation and compensation. Management believes that the consolidated statements of income before special items provide current and prior period results of operations on a comparable basis as well as provide trends that are more indicative of future operating results than GAAP results of operations, given the non-operational and/or non-recurring nature of the special items removed for purposes of reporting results of operations before special items. While some of these items have been periodically reported in Verizon's consolidated results of operations, their occurrence in future periods is dependent upon future business and economic factors, among other evaluation criteria, and may frequently be beyond the control of management. As a result of these factors, management also provides this information externally, along with a complete reconciliation to their comparable GAAP amounts so readers have access to the detail and general nature of adjustments made to GAAP results. Descriptions of the special items are provided in the schedules accompanying the press release.
Management believes that Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer and Verizon Wireless's operating income before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and EBITDA margin, additional non-GAAP financial measures, are also useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating financial performance. Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer is determined by subtracting equipment and other revenue from Verizon Wireless's cost of sales and services and selling, general and administrative expenses, divided by average customers during the period. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA is determined by adding-back depreciation and amortization to operating income and the Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Verizon Wireless's EBITDA by Verizon Wireless's service revenues. Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer, EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP operating performance measures that are used internally to evaluate current operating expense efficiency and operating profitability on a more variable cost basis by excluding the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions (particularly customer base amortization) that occurred in prior years. Cash expense per customer is determined by reflecting equipment and other revenue on a net cost basis in order to illustrate the impact of the net cost of selling handsets and other equipment to the customers and other similar transactions with customers. In addition, Verizon management uses this information to evaluate operating performance in relation to Verizon Wireless's competitors. The Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin utilizes service revenues rather than total revenues. Service revenues exclude primarily equipment revenues (as well as other non-service revenues) in order to capture the impact of providing service to the wireless customer base on an ongoing basis. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA margin is presented along with Verizon Wireless's operating income margin so as not to imply more emphasis should be placed on it than the corresponding GAAP measure. Management believes this presentation assists readers in preparing comparisons of this type of performance measure (operating profitability) using the GAAP measure as well as the measure segment management uses to evaluate segment results and perform comparisons to other wireless carriers.
The pro forma financial information presents the combined operating results of Verizon and the former MCI on a comparable basis, before special items. Management believes this presentation of pro forma financial information before special items assists readers in better understanding our results of operations and trends from period to period, consistent with management's evaluation of Verizon's consolidated and segment results of operations for a variety of internal measures. Management believes that the pro forma financial information provides current and prior period results of operations on a comparable basis and provides trends that are more indicative of future operating results than GAAP results of operations, given the merger during the period and the non-operational and/or non-recurring nature of the special items removed for purposes of reporting results of operations before
special items. Management believes that the combined and Wireline pro forma cash expense information, additional non-GAAP financial measures, are also useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating financial performance. Cash expense is determined by subtracting depreciation and amortization expense from operating expenses before special items. Combined pro forma cash expense and Wireline pro forma cash expense are non-GAAP operating performance measures that are used internally to evaluate current operating expense efficiency on a more variable cost basis. Management provides this information externally, along with a complete reconciliation to their comparable GAAP amounts so readers have access to the detail and general nature of adjustments made to GAAP results. Descriptions of these pro forma items are provided in the schedules accompanying the press release.
It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance understanding of Verizon's GAAP consolidated financial statements and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

Notes: Prior-period amounts have been reclassified to reflect comparable results. See the schedules accompanying this news release and www.verizon.com/investor for reconciliations to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the non-GAAP financial measures included in this announcement. Verizon's 2006 reported results include revenues and expenses from the former MCI, Inc., subsequent to the close of the merger in January 2006. Discontinued operations include Verizon's former directory publishing unit, which was spun-off to shareholders in the fourth quarter 2006, and the operations of Verizon Dominicana C. por A. and Telecomunicaciones de Puerto Rico Inc. (PRT) following second-quarter 2006 agreements to sell the businesses. The Verizon Dominicana sale closed in the fourth quarter 2006.
Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) today reported strong fourth-quarter and full-year 2006 financial and operational results, capping a year in which the company's organic growth initiatives gained momentum in wireless, consumer broadband and global enterprise markets.
NEW YORK 
For the fourth quarter 2006, Verizon reported earnings of $1.0 billion, or 35 cents per share, compared with $1.7 billion, or 59 cents per share, in the fourth quarter 2005. Fourth-quarter 2006 earnings include non-recurring charges for the recognition of taxes related to the sale of Verizon's Dominican Republic assets and for costs related to the spin-off of Verizon's directories publishing business.
Verizon News Release, page 3
Before these and other special items (non-GAAP), Verizon's fourth-quarter 2006 earnings were 62 cents per share, compared with 64 cents per share before special items in the fourth-quarter 2005.
For the year, Verizon reported earnings of $6.2 billion, or $2.12 per share, compared with $7.4 billion, or $2.65 per share, in 2005. Before special items, 2006 earnings were $7.4 billion, or $2.54 per share, compared with $7.2 billion, or $2.56 per share, in 2005.
"We had a strong 2006 both operationally and financially," said Ivan Seidenberg, Verizon chairman and CEO. "We have become a leaner, more competitive and global company, with a greater percentage of our revenues from broadband and other growth initiatives.
"We enter 2007 well-positioned to continue to gain momentum. We have strengthened our balance sheet, in part through strategic transactions that have created shareholder value, and we have assembled the right team to deliver the communications, data and entertainment services that customers want.
"We are focused on execution and continued innovation in 2007. Our superior wireless, consumer broadband and global enterprise networks will differentiate us from competitors and provide Verizon with a platform for long-term, high-margin organic growth."
Consolidated fourth-quarter 2006 operating revenues were $22.6 billion, a 26.1 percent increase compared with the fourth quarter 2005. Full-year 2006 operating revenues were $88.1 billion, a 26.8 percent increase compared with 2005.
Consolidated fourth-quarter 2006 total operating expenses were $19.2 billion, a 29.6 percent increase compared with the fourth quarter 2005. Full-year 2006 total operating expenses
Verizon News Release, page 4
were $74.8 billion, a 31.3 percent increase compared with 2005. For 2006, Verizon's reported results include revenues and expenses from the former MCI, subsequent to the close of the merger on Jan. 6, 2006.
Comparing fourth quarter 2006 with fourth quarter 2005 on a pro-forma (non-GAAP) basis, which presents the combined operating results of Verizon and the former MCI on a comparable basis, adjusted operating revenues increased 3.9 percent and adjusted cash expenses increased 5.4 percent. Comparing full-year 2006 with 2005 on the same basis, adjusted operating revenues increased 3.3 percent and adjusted cash expenses increased 3.0 percent.
Verizon Wireless remains significantly ahead of the industry with record retail net customer additions, and strong revenue growth, profitability and low churn in the fourth quarter 2006.
Verizon Wireless remains the largest U.S. wireless company in terms of total revenues, and the largest wireless data provider based on revenues, and has the most retail customers (businesses and consumers directly served by Verizon Wireless and who buy Verizon Wireless-branded service, rather than customers of the company's resellers).
Verizon Wireless added 2.3 million net customers in the fourth quarter 2006 for a total of 59.1 million customers nationwide, a 15 percent increase in total customers from the end of the fourth quarter 2005. This was the second time in the company's history that quarterly net customer additions exceeded the 2 million mark.
Of the company's net customer additions in the fourth quarter, a record 2.2 million were retail, a 23.6 percent increase over the fourth quarter 2005 and almost all post-paid customers. Based on publicly available information, the company has the largest retail customer base in the industry  56.8 million retail customers of its 59.1 million total customers (which include retail and wholesale)  and the company added 7.8 million to its retail customer base in 2006.
Verizon News Release, page 5
The company continued to set industry records for low churn. Total churn was 1.14 percent for the quarter and 1.17 percent for the year. Churn among the company's retail post-paid customers  almost 93 percent of total customers  was even lower, at 0.89 percent for the fourth quarter and 0.91 percent for the year.
Verizon Wireless quarterly revenues topped $10 billion for the first time. Total revenues were $10.1 billion in the fourth quarter 2006, a 16.3 percent increase compared with $8.7 billion in the fourth quarter 2005  driven by strong customer growth and demand for data services. Full-year 2006 Wireless revenues were $38.0 billion, an increase of 17.8 percent compared with 2005.
Wireless operating income margins were 25.0 percent for the fourth quarter and 25.2 percent for the year, the result of the company's continued focus on efficiencies, even as it added record net retail customers.
Wireless EBITDA margins were 43.2 percent for the fourth quarter and 44.3 percent for the full year, an improvement of 1.1 percentage points from full-year 2005. (EBITDA  or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization  is a non-GAAP measure that adds depreciation and amortization to operating income; EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing EBITDA by wireless service revenues.)
Fourth-quarter results at Wireline highlighted a year of strong customer growth in broadband markets, including video.
Verizon News Release, page 6
Verizon's broadband fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) network  over which customers receive FiOS Internet and FiOS TV services  passed a total of more than 6 million premises by the end of 2006. This exceeds the company's year-end target and more than doubles the number of premises passed by year-end 2005.
Availability of FiOS TV service significantly ramped up in the fourth quarter 2006. FiOS TV was available for sale to 2.4 million premises as of year-end  nearly double the number of premises as at the end of the third quarter 2006. Verizon Telecom, which serves wireline residential and small-business customers, had 207,000 FiOS TV customers at the end of its first full year of offering the service, adding 89,000 in the fourth quarter.
As of year-end 2006, Verizon Telecom provided 7.0 million total broadband connections  which include customers of both DSL and FiOS Internet services  an increase of 35.7 percent compared with year-end 2005. In 2006, Verizon Telecom added more than 1.8 million net new broadband connections, 517,000 of which serve FiOS Internet customers. In the fourth quarter 2006, Verizon Telecom added 409,000 net broadband connections. FiOS Internet customers accounted for 165,000 of the net broadband connection additions in the fourth quarter and totaled 687,000 at year-end.
In the consumer market, new broadband and video sales have more than made up for a reduction in primary wireline voice access lines of customers who turned to wireless, cable or Internet protocol (IP) services. Verizon Telecom added 142,000 more net broadband and video customers during the fourth quarter 2006 than it lost in primary wireline voice access lines, compared with 120,000 added in the third quarter 2006. Primary residential access lines decreased by 366,000 in the fourth quarter 2006 compared with the third quarter 2006, while Verizon added 508,000 residential broadband and video customers over the same period.
Verizon News Release, page 7
At year-end 2006, Verizon served 45.1 million total domestic wireline access lines  which also include secondary residential lines, public telephones, business lines and wholesale voice connections. This is a 7.6 percent decrease compared with year-end 2005.
Verizon Business, which provides advanced communications and information technology solutions to large-business and government customers globally, generated sequential revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter as well as year-over-year revenue growth for the fourth quarter 2006. The company is the only major U.S.-based enterprise carrier to show such growth in that market.
Verizon Business operating revenues rose to $5.3 billion in the fourth quarter 2006. This is a 2.3 percent increase compared with the third quarter 2006, and a 2.7 percent increase compared with the fourth quarter 2005 (pro-forma).
During 2006, Verizon realized approximately $600 million in synergies from the integration of the former MCI, ahead of the company's year-end target of $550 million. With systems integration projects well under way, Verizon has increased its 2007 MCI synergy target to $900 million, from $825 million.
Verizon Business again launched new products and capabilities during the quarter as it continued to meet the ongoing global enterprise market shift to IP-based products and services. New offerings included expansion of the company's VoIP (voice over IP) and Ethernet capabilities internationally; cutting-edge video- and Web-based conferencing capabilities; and enhancements to its virtual private network portfolio. Verizon Business also signed an agreement with five major Asia-Pacific carriers to build the first next-generation, high-speed cable system directly linking mainland China and the United States, further highlighting the company's global presence and growth.
Verizon News Release, page 8
At the consolidated level, cash flows from continuing operations were $23.0 billion in 2006, compared with $20.4 billion in 2005. Capital expenditures totaled $17.1 billion in 2006, including $1.6 billion due to the inclusion of former MCI, compared with $15.0 billion in 2005.
Verizon repurchased $1.7 billion in shares in 2006 and returned $4.7 billion in dividends to shareholders. Verizon's total debt at the end of 2006 was $36.4 billion, compared with $38.3 billion at the end of 2005, excluding debt from discontinued operations.
Verizon's adjusted earnings from continuing operations (non-GAAP) exclude income from directories publishing, Verizon Dominicana and PRT, and were 52 cents per share for the fourth quarter 2006 and $2.06 per share for the full year.
Special items in the fourth quarter 2006 included $541 million, or 19 cents per share, related to the sale of Verizon Dominicana which, as previously announced, was due to the impact of taxes on reinvested earnings net of a pre-tax gain on the sale. Other special items were 3 cents per share in charges for costs related to the fourth-quarter spin-off of Verizon's directories publishing business, and a total of 5 cents per share for severance, pension and benefits charges; MCI merger integration costs; and relocation and other costs related to establishing the Verizon Center in New Jersey. Special items in the fourth quarter 2005 included a total of 4 cents per share in net expenses for changes to management retirement benefit plans, as well as severance and relocation costs.
 
Verizon News Release, page 9
Special items for the full-year 2006 totaled 42 cents per share in charges, including the 27 cents per share detailed above for the fourth quarter; additional severance, pension and benefits charges, and merger integration and relocation costs in the first three quarters; the extinguishment of debt; and the cumulative effect of an accounting change.
Special items for 2005 included non-recurring gains of 12 cents per share each related to tax benefits and the sale of operations in Hawaii. These gains were partially offset by a total of 15 cents per share in charges for a net tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign earnings, as well as asset impairments and other costs.
In January 2007, the government of Venezuela issued statements expressing its intent to nationalize certain companies, including Compaa Annima Nacional Telfonos de Venezuela (CANTV). As a result of these statements, Verizon is evaluating the potential effect on its investment in CANTV, which is currently carried at approximately $750 million.
Verizon is targeting capital expenditures of from $17.5 billion to $17.9 billion in 2007. As part of that total, Wireline capital expenditures are expected in the range of $10.7 billion to $10.9 billion, and Wireless capital expenditures are expected in the range of $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion. Verizon is also targeting approximately the same level of share repurchases in 2007 as the $1.7 billion repurchased in 2006.
Earnings dilution from FiOS deployment  which, as previously announced, will be at its peak through the first quarter 2007  is expected to be about 11 cents per share in the first quarter and then decline in each successive quarter in 2007.
Following are highlights for Verizon's Wireless and Wireline business segments.
