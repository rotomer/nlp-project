Item 8.01 Other Events.
On a January 29, 2007 conference call with financial analysts and investors, Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon) discussed its fourth quarter 2006 and full year results. In 2007, Verizon expects, on an adjusted basis, relatively flat pension and postretirement costs compared to 2006 and operating income growth of at least 10 percent. Earnings dilution from Verizon's fiber-to-the-premises deployment strategy, known as FiOS, is expected to be in the mid thirties cent range in 2007. Verizon continues to target wireless EBITDA margins (EBITDA  or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization  adds depreciation and amortization to operating income; EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing EBITDA by wireless service revenues) to be in the 43 to 45 percent range in a high growth environment. Verizon expects adjusted full year 2007 wireline operating income margins to be generally stable with those of 2006, increasing over the course of the year, subject to some variability from quarter to quarter.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
