On July 19, 2007, Verizon Wireless and Broadcom Corporation entered into a license agreement that permits the continued importation and sale by Verizon Wireless of mobile devices that are the subject of the current patent infringement cases between Broadcom and Qualcomm Incorporated before the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) and in federal court.
The agreement allows Verizon Wireless to sell new handsets and other wireless devices that were banned by the ITC's June 7, 2007 exclusion order. Under the agreement, Verizon Wireless will make payments to Broadcom at a rate of $6.00 for each 1xEV-DO handset, PDA, data card, or other wireless device sold on or after July 19, 2007, subject to a maximum payment of $40 million per calendar quarter and a lifetime maximum payment of $200 million. The agreement provides Verizon a perpetual license to the six Broadcom patents currently being litigated between Broadcom and Qualcomm subject to making the maximum payment and other terms of the agreement. Given the limits of the payments under the agreement, Verizon does not expect that there will be a material effect on Verizon Wireless's annual results.
As a result of the agreement, Verizon Wireless has ceased its efforts to overturn the ITC's order.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
