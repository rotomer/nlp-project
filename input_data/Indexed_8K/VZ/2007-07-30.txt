Attached as an exhibit hereto is a press release and financial tables dated July 30, 2007 issued by Verizon Communications Inc.
Non-GAAP Measures
Verizon's press release and financial tables include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.
The consolidated statements of income before special items eliminate special items and non-recurring items of revenues, expenses, gains and losses primarily as a result of their non-operational and/or non-recurring nature. This also includes current and prior periods' operating revenues and operating expenses of non-strategic operations sold in the current year-to-date period. Management believes this presentation of operating performance assists readers in better understanding our results of operations and trends from period to period, consistent with management's evaluation of Verizon's consolidated and segment results of operations for a variety of internal measures including strategic business planning, capital allocation and compensation. Management believes that the consolidated statements of income before special items provide current and prior period results of operations on a comparable basis as well as provide trends that are more indicative of future operating results than GAAP results of operations, given the non-operational and/or non-recurring nature of the special items removed for purposes of reporting results of operations before special items. While some of these items have been periodically reported in Verizon's consolidated results of operations, their occurrence in future periods is dependent upon future business and economic factors, among other evaluation criteria, and may frequently be beyond the control of management. As a result of these factors, management also provides this information externally, along with a complete reconciliation to their comparable GAAP amounts so readers have access to the detail and general nature of adjustments made to GAAP results. Descriptions of the special items are provided in the schedules accompanying the press release.
Management believes that Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer and Verizon Wireless's operating income before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and EBITDA margin, additional non-GAAP financial measures, are also useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating financial performance. Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer is determined by subtracting equipment and other revenue from Verizon Wireless's cost of sales and services and selling, general and administrative expenses, divided by average customers during the period. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA is determined by adding-back depreciation and amortization to operating income and the Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Verizon Wireless's EBITDA by Verizon Wireless's service revenues. Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer, EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP operating performance measures that are used internally to evaluate current operating expense efficiency and operating profitability on a more variable cost basis by excluding the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions (particularly customer base amortization) that occurred in prior years. Cash expense per customer is determined by reflecting equipment and other revenue on a net cost basis in order to illustrate the impact of the net cost of selling handsets and other equipment to the customers and other similar transactions with customers. In addition, Verizon management uses this information to evaluate operating performance in relation to Verizon Wireless's competitors. The Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin utilizes service revenues rather than total revenues. Service revenues exclude primarily equipment revenues (as well as other non-service revenues) in order to capture the impact of providing service to the wireless customer base on an ongoing basis. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA margin is presented along with Verizon Wireless's operating income margin so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on it than the corresponding GAAP measure. Management believes that this presentation assists readers in preparing comparisons of this type of performance measure (operating profitability) using the GAAP measure as well as the measure segment management uses to evaluate segment results and perform comparisons to other wireless carriers.
The pro forma financial information presents the combined operating results of Verizon and the former MCI on a comparable basis, before special items. Management believes this presentation of pro forma financial information before special items assists readers in better understanding our results of operations and trends from period to period, consistent with management's evaluation of Verizon's consolidated and segment results of operations for a variety of internal measures. Management believes that the pro forma financial information provides current and prior period results of operations on a comparable basis and provides trends that are more indicative of future operating results than GAAP results of operations, given the merger during 2006 and the non-operational and/or non-recurring nature of the special items removed for purposes of reporting results of operations before special items. Management provides this information externally, along with a complete reconciliation to their comparable GAAP amounts so readers have access to the detail and general nature of adjustments made to GAAP results. Descriptions of these pro forma items are provided in the schedules accompanying the press release.
It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance understanding of Verizon's GAAP consolidated financial statements and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

for reconciliations to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the non-GAAP financial measures included in this announcement. Discontinued operations include Verizon Information Services, as well as interests in Verizon Dominicana C. por A. and Telecomunicaciones de Puerto Rico, Inc. The dispositions of these non-strategic businesses were completed on Nov. 17, 2006; Dec. 1, 2006; and March 30, 2007, respectively.
Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) today reported strong second-quarter 2007 financial and operational results, as the company expanded margins while continuing revenue growth momentum in its key strategic markets  wireless, broadband, data, video and global IP.
NEW YORK 
Verizon reported second-quarter 2007 earnings of $1.7 billion, or 58 cents in fully diluted earnings per share (EPS). This compares with reported EPS in the second quarter 2006 of 43 cents before discontinued operations. Including results from discontinued operations, which Verizon has since divested, second-quarter 2006 reported earnings were 55 cents per share.
On an adjusted basis (non-GAAP), Verizon's second-quarter 2007 earnings totaled $1.7 billion, or 58 cents in EPS. This is an increase of 11.5 percent compared with 52 cents per share before discontinued operations in the second quarter 2006.
Adjustments for special items in the second quarter 2007 included less than a penny per share in merger integration costs. Adjusted earnings in the second quarter 2006 reflected 9 cents per share in special items, consisting of severance and related pension and benefits charges, merger integration and Verizon Center relocation costs.

"Verizon's strategy of focusing on organic revenue growth and improving margins continues to gain momentum," said Chairman and CEO Ivan Seidenberg. "Results show that we are producing accelerating  and sustainable  top-line growth across all key markets.
"Verizon is also generating strong operating cash flows, which we expect to improve throughout the year. With our strong balance sheet and investment in advanced network platforms, we can continue to drive future earnings growth and return value to shareholders. We are confident we have the products and services, distribution infrastructure and customer service capabilities to continue to capture share from the competition in strategic markets."
Verizon's total operating revenues grew 6.3 percent to $23.3 billion, compared with the second quarter of 2006. Year-over-year operating revenues grew 6.5 percent on an adjusted basis (non-GAAP).
Verizon's total operating expenses increased to $19.1 billion, or 2.4 percent year over year. On an adjusted basis (non-GAAP), operating expenses increased 4.8 percent to $19.1 billion over the same period.
On a reported basis, Verizon's operating income grew 29.0 percent year over year to $4.1 billion and, on an adjusted basis, by 14.9 percent to $4.2 billion. Operating income margin rose to 17.8 percent, compared with 14.7 percent in the second quarter 2006. On an adjusted basis, Verizon's operating income margin rose to 17.9 percent, compared with 16.6 percent in the second quarter 2006 and 17.3 percent in the first quarter 2007.
Verizon News Release, page 4
Margin expansion and revenue growth contributed to $11.6 billion in operating cash flows from continuing operations in the first half of 2007. This represents an increase of more than $800 million, or 7.5 percent, compared with the first half of 2006.
Capital expenditures totaled $4.4 billion in the second quarter 2007, in line with the company's guidance for full-year expenditures.
Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $32.5 billion, down from $34.7 billion at the end of the first quarter 2007.
Verizon Wireless continued its record of strong, industry-leading retail net customer additions, revenue growth, low churn and profitability.
Verizon Wireless remains the largest U.S. wireless company in terms of total revenues and data revenues. In addition, it has 60.1 million retail customers  the most customers of any wireless brand. In the second quarter:

Verizon's Wireline business  which includes Verizon Telecom, serving domestic residential and small-business customers, and Verizon Business, serving large-business and government customers globally  reported accelerating growth in sales of FiOS fiber-optic services and sales of strategic services to enterprise customers. In the second quarter 2007:
 
 
 
Verizon News Release, page 6
Sales of FiOS TV continued to accelerate as Verizon Telecom added a net of 167,000 new FiOS TV customers in the second quarter 2007. Net customer additions averaged about 2,600 per business day in the quarter. The company had a total of 515,000 FiOS TV customers as of the end of the second quarter 2007  an addition of 460,000 FiOS TV customers since the end of the second quarter 2006.
Complementing the FiOS TV rollout, the company added 125,000 satellite TV customers in partnership with DIRECTV in the second quarter 2007. At the end of the quarter, Verizon had a total of nearly 1.3 million video customers.
Second-quarter revenues in Verizon Telecom's consumer market decreased by 2.1 percent, to $4.2 billion, compared with the second quarter 2006. In legacy Verizon markets, year-over-year consumer revenues grew 3.4 percent, to $3.8 billion, in the second quarter 2007, more than doubling the year-over-year growth rate reported in the first quarter 2007. ("Legacy Verizon" excludes former MCI consumer markets, where Verizon's strategic focus has led to expected declines.) ARPU in these markets increased 10.9 percent, to $57.47, comparing second quarter 2007 with second quarter 2006, as customers purchased value-added broadband services.
Verizon Business reported second-quarter 2007 revenues of $5.3 billion, or growth of 2.4 percent compared with the second quarter 2006 on an adjusted basis (non-GAAP). This is the third consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year pro-forma revenue growth (non-GAAP, calculated as if Verizon and MCI had merged on Jan. 1, 2006).
Verizon News Release, page 7
Overall revenue growth at Verizon Business was driven by the continued momentum of strong sales of key strategic services, such as IP (Internet protocol) and managed services as well as Ethernet and optical ring services. In the second quarter 2007, strategic services generated $1.3 billion in revenue, up 25.5 percent from the second quarter 2006.
Growth in revenues from strategic services also continued to exceed declines in revenues from core services, such as traditional voice and data services. Strategic services revenues were also up sequentially, increasing 9.3 percent from the first quarter 2007.
Verizon Business rolled out significant enhancements to its global networking and managed services offerings during the quarter. On July 1, Verizon Business became the leading provider of managed security services to business and government customers worldwide with the completion of its previously announced acquisition of Cybertrust.
