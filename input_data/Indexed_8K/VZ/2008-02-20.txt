Item 8.01 Other Events
On a February 20, 2008 investor relations conference call, Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon) provided an update on the recently announced Verizon Wireless Nationwide Unlimited Anytime Minute Plans. Verizon indicated that there are currently approximately 305,000 single line customers, or 0.5% of its customer base, with monthly voice price plans in excess of $99.99 per month. The average monthly voice revenue for such customers is between $125 and $135 per month. Verizon believes that, over time, the reduced revenues from these higher value customers moving down to the unlimited plan will be more than offset by increased revenues as a result of customers moving up in value to the unlimited plan.
Attached as an exhibit is a summary of the voice pricing under the Verizon Wireless Nationwide Unlimited Anytime Minute Plans.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
