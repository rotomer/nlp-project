Attached as an exhibit hereto is a press release and financial tables dated April 28, 2008 issued by Verizon Communications Inc.
Non-GAAP Measures
Verizon's press release and financial tables include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.
The consolidated statements of income before special items eliminate items of revenues, expenses, gains and losses as a result of their non-operational and/or non-recurring nature. Management believes this presentation of operating performance assists readers in better understanding our results of operations and trends from period to period, consistent with management's evaluation of Verizon's consolidated and segment results of operations for a variety of internal measures including strategic business planning, capital allocation and compensation. Management believes that the consolidated statements of income before special items provide current and prior period results of operations on a comparable basis as well as provide trends that are more indicative of future operating results than GAAP results of operations, given the non-operational and/or non-recurring nature of the special items removed for purposes of reporting results of operations before special items. While some of these items have been periodically reported in Verizon's consolidated results of operations, their occurrence in future periods is dependent upon future business and economic factors, among other evaluation criteria, and may frequently be beyond the control of management. As a result of these factors, management also provides this information externally, along with a complete reconciliation to their comparable GAAP amounts so readers have access to the detail and general nature of adjustments made to GAAP results. Descriptions of the special items are provided in the schedules accompanying the press release.
Management believes that Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer and Verizon Wireless's EBITDA and EBITDA margin, additional non-GAAP financial measures, are also useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating financial performance. Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer is determined by subtracting equipment and other revenue from Verizon Wireless's cost of sales and services and selling, general and administrative expenses, divided by average customers during the period. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA is determined by adding-back depreciation and amortization to operating income and the Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Verizon Wireless's EBITDA by Verizon Wireless's service revenues. Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer, EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP operating performance measures that are used internally to evaluate current operating expense efficiency and operating profitability on a more variable cost basis by excluding the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions (particularly customer base amortization) that occurred in prior years. Cash expense per customer is determined by reflecting equipment and other revenue on a net cost basis in order to illustrate the impact of the net cost of selling handsets and other equipment to the customers and other similar transactions with customers. In addition, Verizon management uses this information to evaluate operating performance in relation to Verizon Wireless's competitors. The Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin utilizes service revenues rather than total revenues. Service revenues exclude primarily equipment revenues (as well as other non-service revenues) in order to capture the impact of providing service to the wireless customer base on an ongoing basis. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA margin is presented along with Verizon Wireless's operating income margin so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on it than the corresponding GAAP measure. Management believes that this presentation assists readers in preparing comparisons of this type of performance measure (operating profitability) using the GAAP measure as well as the measure management uses to evaluate segment results and perform comparisons to other wireless carriers.
It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance understanding of Verizon's GAAP consolidated financial statements and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) today reported another quarter of strong sales and operational results. In the first quarter 2008, Verizon Wireless continued to lead the industry in key metrics, and Verizon's Wireline business reported continued strong growth in sales of domestic FiOS services and global strategic business services.
NEW YORK 
Verizon reported first-quarter 2008 earnings of 57 cents in diluted earnings per share (EPS). This compares with first-quarter 2007 earnings of 51 cents per share, both before and after an extraordinary item and income from discontinued operations that have been divested.
On an adjusted basis (non-GAAP), first-quarter 2008 earnings were 61 cents per share. This is a 13.0 percent increase, compared with 54 cents per share before discontinued operations in the first quarter 2007  Verizon's fifth consecutive quarter of a double-digit percentage increase in adjusted EPS.
Adjusted earnings in the first quarter 2008 excluded 4 cents per share in special items: 3 cents per share for costs related to the spinoff of wireline access lines in three states, completed March 31, 2008; and 1 cent per share in merger integration costs. Adjusted earnings in the first quarter 2007 excluded an extraordinary loss of 5 cents in EPS from the nationalization and sale of Verizon's interest in Compaa Annima Nacional Telfonos de Venezuela.
"Verizon has weathered the current economic uncertainty with strong first-quarter results," said Verizon Chairman and CEO Ivan Seidenberg. "I am also confident of our position over the long term because we have further opportunities to drive revenue growth and further opportunities to eliminate costs.

"With our strong cash flows, we continue to invest in growth, evolve our business and return value to shareholders," he said. "In a larger sense, Verizon is leading an industry transformation. In wireless, we are changing the game with our open development initiative, our plans for next-generation technology deployment, and our strategic investment in spectrum for nationwide broadband services. In wireline, we have spun off nonstrategic access lines, and we continue to introduce innovative FiOS and enterprise services."
Verizon's total operating revenues grew 5.5 percent to $23.8 billion, compared with the first quarter 2007. Total operating expenses increased 3.8 percent to $19.5 billion over the same period.
Verizon's operating income grew 14.1 percent to $4.3 billion, compared with the first quarter 2007. On an adjusted basis (non-GAAP), operating income grew 14.2 percent to $4.5 billion. Operating income margin rose to 18.2 percent, compared with 16.8 percent in the first quarter 2007. On an adjusted basis, Verizon's operating income margin rose to 18.7 percent, compared with 17.3 percent in the first quarter 2007.
Cash flows from continuing operations totaled $5.4 billion through the first three months of 2008, up 6.9 percent over the same period last year. During the first quarter 2008, Verizon took advantage of market conditions to repurchase $1 billion of its common stock.
Total debt was $35.8 billion, compared with $31.2 billion at year-end 2007, and Verizon ended the quarter with $5.5 billion in cash and equivalents. Most of this cash, along with $4 billion in capital raised through long-term borrowings in April, has been used to pay for the wireless licenses won in the Federal Communications Commission's 700 MHz spectrum auction.
