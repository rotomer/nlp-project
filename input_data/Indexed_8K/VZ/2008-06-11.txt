Pursuant to the Debt Purchase Agreement the Sellers agreed to sell to Verizon Wireless approximately $4.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior interim loans (the "Loans") under the senior interim loan credit agreement, dated as of November 16, 2007, among ACI, ACFI, the Administrative Agent and the lenders party thereto (the "Senior Interim Loan Agreement").

The foregoing description of the Minority Debt Holder Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Minority Debt Holder Purchase Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 99.4 hereto, and is incorporated into this report by reference.
On June 10, 2008, Verizon Wireless completed the purchase of the Loans pursuant to the Debt Purchase Agreement and the Minority Debt Holder Purchase Agreement.
 
On June 5, 2008, Verizon Wireless entered into a $7.550 billion 364-Day Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent and as lead arranger and bookrunner, and the lenders named therein. The Credit Agreement includes a $4.8 billion term facility and a $2.75 billion delayed draw facility. The borrowings under each facility are subject to customary conditions precedent. The Credit Agreement provides that the proceeds of the loans under the Credit Agreement may be used for any one or more of the following: (a) the debt purchase transactions pursuant to the Debt Purchase Agreement and the Minority Debt Holder Purchase Agreement, (b) the completion of Verizon Wireless's acquisition of Rural Cellular Corporation and the refinancing of the outstanding indebtedness of that corporation, (c) the payment of fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing, and (d) general corporate purposes in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding $5,000,000. The delayed draw facility is available until the 90
th
day following the date of the execution of the Credit Agreement and may be drawn down in up to three installments. The Credit Agreement matures on June 4, 2009. Consenting lenders may agree with Verizon Wireless to extend the maturity date on their loans for an additional period of one year.
On June 10, 2008, Verizon Wireless borrowed $4,795,000,000 under the Credit Agreement in order to complete the purchase of the Loans pursuant to the Debt Purchase Agreement and the Minority Debt Holder Purchase Agreement.
Interest Rate and Fees
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to, at the option of Verizon Wireless, (i) the base rate (defined as the greater of the rate published in as the "prime lending rate" or the federal funds rate plus 0.50%) or (ii) LIBOR, in each case plus a margin to be determined by reference to the long-term credit rating of Verizon Wireless issued by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. Initially, borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to the base rate plus 0.00% or LIBOR plus 0.75%. The interest rate on the loans increases 0.25% if the aggregate principal amount of the loans outstanding on the date that is six months following the Effective Date (as defined in the Credit Agreement) exceeds $1,887,500,000. In addition, Verizon Wireless will pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the delayed draw facility at a rate to be determined by reference to the long-term credit rating of Verizon Wireless issued by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. Initially, the commitment fee on the unused portion of the delayed draw facility is 0.080%.
The Wall Street Journal
Prepayments
The Credit Agreement requires Verizon Wireless to prepay the loans and terminate unused commitments with 100% of the net cash proceeds received from issuances or sales of equity (in each case subject to specified exceptions, including certain intercompany transactions and equity issuances and sales to Vodafone Group plc or any of its subsidiaries) and incurrences of indebtedness constituting borrowed money.
Covenants and Events of Default
The Credit Agreement contains certain negative covenants, including a negative pledge covenant, a fundamental changes covenant and an accounting changes covenant, and affirmative covenants and events of default that are customary for companies maintaining an investment grade credit rating. An event of default may result in the termination of any unused commitments and the acceleration of the outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires Verizon Wireless to maintain a Leverage Ratio (as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement) not in excess of 3.25:1.00.

Exhibit 99.5
NEWS RELEASE
 
Verizon Wireless has entered into an agreement with Alltel Corporation and Atlantis Holdings LLC, an affiliate of private investment firm TPG Capital and GS Capital Partners, to acquire Alltel Corporation in a cash merger. Verizon Wireless is a joint venture of Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) and Vodafone (NYSE and LSE: VOD).
BASKING RIDGE, N.J., and LITTLE ROCK, Ark. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Verizon Wireless will acquire the equity of Alltel for approximately $5.9 billion. Based on Alltel's projected net debt at closing of $22.2 billion, the aggregate value of the transaction is $28.1 billion.
The parties are targeting completion of the merger by the end of the year, subject to obtaining regulatory approvals.
Once this transaction closes, customers of both companies will have access to an expanded range of products and services, including a premier lineup of basic and advanced devices and an expanded IN Network calling community. Alltel customers also will benefit from advanced services including over-the-air downloadable music from a three-million-song library, and a network that is nationwide, for a uniform coast-to-coast experience. They also will be able to take advantage of industry-leading consumer policies, including Test Drive and Worry Free Guarantee.
"This move will create an enhanced platform of network coverage, spectrum and customer care to better serve the growing needs of both Alltel and Verizon Wireless customers for reliable basic and advanced broadband wireless services," said Lowell McAdam, Verizon Wireless president and chief executive officer.
Alltel serves more than 13 million customers in markets in 34 states. This includes 57 primarily rural markets that Verizon Wireless does not serve. The transaction puts the Alltel markets and customers on a path to advanced 4
th
generation services as Verizon Wireless deploys LTE technology throughout its network over the next several years. Alltel's customers also will reap the benefits of Verizon Wireless' Open Development initiative, which welcomes third-party devices and services to use the Verizon Wireless network.
Verizon Communications, the owner of the majority stake in Verizon Wireless, expects that the transaction will be immediately accretive, excluding transaction and integration costs. "This is a perfect fit, with Alltel's high-value post-paid customer base, its solid financials, our common network technology, and significant, readily attainable synergies," said Ivan Seidenberg, Verizon chief executive officer and chairman of the Verizon board. "Verizon Wireless' acquisition of Alltel clearly provides opportunities for enhanced value for Verizon shareholders."
Alltel President and Chief Executive Officer Scott Ford will continue in his current position as head of Alltel until the merger is completed.
"Both Alltel and Verizon Wireless have long track records of delivering a high-quality customer experience in the marketplace," Ford said. "The combination of our two companies will continue and improve upon that heritage as, together, we can more quickly deliver an expanded range of innovative products and services to our customers."
Verizon Wireless expects to realize synergies with a net present value, after integration costs, of more than $9 billion driven by reduced capital and operating expense savings. Synergies are expected to generate incremental cost savings of $1 billion in the second year after closing.
 
Alltel and Verizon Wireless both use a common network technology, which provides advantages of a seamless transition for Alltel customers, ease in integrating the two companies' networks, and scale efficiencies in operating the larger integrated network.
Morgan Stanley acted as financial advisor to Verizon Wireless on this transaction and is providing bridge financing. Debevoise & Plimpton LLP acted as legal advisor to Verizon Wireless.
Citibank, Goldman Sachs and RBS advised the sellers on the transaction. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz acted as legal advisor to Alltel, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP and Ropes & Gray LLP acted as legal advisors to the sellers.
