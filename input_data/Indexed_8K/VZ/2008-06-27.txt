On June 27, 2008, Verizon Communications Inc. ("Verizon") posted to the Verizon Investor Relations web site a supplemental note regarding historical financial information adjusted for the exclusion of Verizon's Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont local exchange and related business assets following the completion of the spin-off on March 31, 2008. The supplemental note is attached as Exhibit 99 to this report.
NOTE: This report contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The following important factors could affect future results and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements: materially adverse changes in economic and industry conditions and labor matters, including workforce levels and labor negotiations, and any resulting financial and/or operational impact, in the markets served by us or by companies in which we have substantial investments; material changes in available technology, including disruption of our suppliers' provisioning of critical products or services; the impact of natural or man-made disasters or litigation and any resulting financial impact not covered by insurance; technology substitution; an adverse change in the ratings afforded our debt securities by nationally accredited ratings organizations; the final results of federal and state regulatory proceedings concerning our provision of retail and wholesale services and judicial review of those results; the effects of competition in our markets; the timing, scope and financial impacts of our deployment of fiber-to-the-premises broadband technology; the ability of Verizon Wireless to continue to obtain sufficient spectrum resources; changes in our accounting assumptions that regulatory agencies, including the SEC, may require or that result from changes in the accounting rules or their application, which could result in an impact on earnings; and the ability to complete acquisitions and dispositions.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99
The historical information file (2006 through the first quarter 2008) and the first quarter 2008 supplemental schedule on Verizon's Investor Relations web site were updated on June 20, 2008 to reflect the exclusion of the Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont local exchange and related business assets following the completion of the spin-off on March 31, 2008. The first quarter 2008 supplemental schedule also adjusted the appropriate volume metrics to exclude Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont operations. Any sequential increase in access line losses or decrease in FiOS volumes in the second quarter 2008 would be unrelated to that reclassification.
