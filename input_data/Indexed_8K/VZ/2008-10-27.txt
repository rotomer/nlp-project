Attached as an exhibit hereto is a press release and financial tables dated October 27, 2008 issued by Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon).
Non-GAAP Measures
Verizon's press release and financial tables include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.
The consolidated statements of income before special items eliminate items of revenues, expenses, gains and losses primarily as a result of their non-operational and/or non-recurring nature. This also includes the current and prior periods' operating revenues and operating expenses of non-strategic local exchange and related business assets in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont that were spun off in the current year-to-date period, which were determined using specific information where available and allocations where data is not maintained on a state-specific basis within Verizon's books and records. Management believes this presentation of operating performance assists readers in better understanding our results of operations and trends from period to period, consistent with management's evaluation of Verizon's consolidated and segment results of operations for a variety of internal measures including strategic business planning, capital allocation and compensation. Management believes that the consolidated statements of income before special items provide current and prior period results of operations on a comparable basis as well as provide trends that are more indicative of future operating results than GAAP results of operations, given the non-operational and/or non-recurring nature of the special items removed for purposes of reporting results of operations before special items. While some of these items have been periodically reported in Verizon's consolidated results of operations, their occurrence in future periods is dependent upon future business and economic factors, among other evaluation criteria, and may frequently be beyond the control of management. As a result of these factors, management also provides this information externally, along with a complete reconciliation to their comparable GAAP amounts, so readers have access to the detail and general nature of adjustments made to GAAP results. Descriptions of the special items are provided in the schedules accompanying the press release.
Management believes that Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer and Verizon Wireless's operating income before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and EBITDA margin, additional non-GAAP financial measures, are also useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating financial performance. Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer is determined by subtracting equipment and other revenue from Verizon Wireless's cost of sales and services and selling, general and administrative expenses, divided by average customers during the period. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA is determined by adding-back depreciation and amortization to operating income and the Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Verizon Wireless's EBITDA by Verizon Wireless's service revenues. Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer, EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP operating performance measures that are used internally to evaluate current operating expense efficiency and operating profitability on a more variable cost basis by excluding the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions (particularly customer base amortization) that occurred in prior years. Cash expense per customer is determined by reflecting equipment and other revenue on a net cost basis in order to illustrate the impact of the net cost of selling handsets and other equipment to the customers and other similar transactions with customers. In addition, Verizon management uses this information to evaluate operating performance in relation to Verizon Wireless's competitors. The Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin utilizes service revenues rather than total revenues. Service revenues exclude primarily equipment revenues (as well as other non-service revenues) in order to capture the impact of providing service to the wireless customer base on an ongoing basis. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA margin is presented along with Verizon Wireless's operating income margin so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on it than the corresponding GAAP measure. Management believes that this presentation assists readers in preparing comparisons of this type of performance measure (operating profitability) using the GAAP measure as well as the measure management uses to evaluate segment results and perform comparisons to other wireless carriers.
It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial statements and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

for reconciliations to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for non-GAAP financial measures cited in this news release. Discontinued operations relate to the disposition of Telecomunicaciones de Puerto Rico, Inc. that was completed on March 30, 2007. Reclassifications of prior-period amounts have been made, where appropriate, to reflect comparable operating results for the spinoff of the Wireline segment's non-strategic local exchange and related business assets in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont in the first quarter of 2008.
Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) today reported strong results in the third quarter 2008, supported by Verizon Wireless' continued strong performance, accelerating numbers of new FiOS customers, and continued increased sales of strategic business services.
NEW YORK 
Verizon reported 59 cents in diluted earnings per share (EPS) in the third quarter 2008, compared with 44 cents per share in the third quarter 2007.
On an adjusted basis (non-GAAP), third-quarter 2008 earnings were 66 cents per share, compared with 63 cents per share in the third quarter 2007.
"Verizon again reported solid revenue, earnings and cash flow growth this quarter," said Chairman and CEO Ivan Seidenberg. "The strategic investments we made over the past few years continue to drive growth in wireless, enterprise, broadband and video.
"Although the capital markets and economy may present challenges, we will continue to execute on our business plan and invest for future growth," he said. "We increased the dividend 7 percent this quarter, reflecting confidence in continued growth opportunities. Verizon has a great set of assets and an employee team focused on creating value for our customers and shareholders."
Verizon's total operating revenues grew 4.1 percent to $24.8 billion in the third quarter 2008, from $23.8 billion in the third quarter 2007. This is an increase of 5.4 percent when
Verizon News Release, page 3
adjusted for the spinoff of non-strategic local exchange and related Wireline business assets earlier this year (non-GAAP). Total operating expenses increased 5.2 percent to $20.6 billion, or 5.4 percent on an adjusted basis, comparing third-quarter 2008 with third-quarter 2007.
Cash flows from continuing operations were $19.1 billion through the first nine months of 2008, up 5.9 percent compared with the same period last year. Capital expenditures were $12.6 billion through the first nine months of 2008, down more than $200 million over the same period last year. Verizon is on track to deliver lower overall capital spending in 2008, compared with 2007. Total debt was $44.8 billion, compared with $43.1 billion at the end of the second quarter 2008.
Adjusted earnings in the third quarter 2008 excluded $164 million after-tax, or 6 cents per share, for severance, pension and benefit charges recognized primarily as a result of workforce reductions; and $32 million after-tax, or 1 cent per share, for merger integration costs. Adjusted earnings in the third quarter 2007 excluded charges of 19 cents per share in special items: 16 cents per share for international taxes, 2 cents per share for costs related to the spinoff of non-strategic Wireline assets and 1 cent per share for merger integration costs.
Verizon Wireless continued its uninterrupted record of industry-leading customer loyalty and profitability. In the third quarter:
