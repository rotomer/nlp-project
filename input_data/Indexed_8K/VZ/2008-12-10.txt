Item 8.01. Other Events.
Verizon Communications Inc. stated that Cellco Partnership doing business as Verizon Wireless ("Verizon Wireless") is on track to receive its remaining regulatory and court approvals to close its pending acquisition of Alltel Corporation, and currently expects that the Alltel acquisition will close in early to mid-January of 2009.
Verizon Wireless has also received commitments from eight financial institutions to provide $17 billion of financing for the Alltel acquisition. The commitments are subject to the preparation and execution of definitive documentation, concurrent closing of the Alltel acquisition, absence of a material adverse change in the business of Verizon Wireless or Alltel and certain other conditions. There can be no assurance that these conditions will be met, or that Verizon Wireless will enter into this financing. Assuming all conditions are satisfied and Verizon Wireless enters into this financing, Verizon Wireless believes that it will have sufficient capital to fund the Alltel acquisition.
