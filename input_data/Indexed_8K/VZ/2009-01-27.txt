Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On January 27, 2009, Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon) issued a press release and financial tables relating to its results for the 2008 fiscal year and the quarter ended December 31, 2008 (see Exhibit 99).
Non-GAAP Measures
Verizon's press release and financial tables include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.
The consolidated statements of income before special items eliminate items of revenues, expenses, gains and losses primarily as a result of their non-operational and/or non-recurring nature. These adjustments also include the current and prior periods' operating revenues and operating expenses of non-strategic local exchange and related business assets in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont that were spun off in the current year-to-date period, which were determined using specific information where available and allocations where data is not maintained on a state-specific basis within Verizon's books and records. Management believes this presentation of operating performance assists readers in better understanding our results of operations and trends from period to period, consistent with management's evaluation of Verizon's consolidated and segment results of operations for a variety of internal measures including strategic business planning, capital allocation and compensation. Management believes that the consolidated statements of income before special items provide current and prior period results of operations on a comparable basis as well as provide trends that are more indicative of future operating results than GAAP results of operations, given the non-operational and/or non-recurring nature of the special items removed for purposes of reporting results of operations before special items. While some of these items have been periodically reported in Verizon's consolidated results of operations, their occurrence in future periods is dependent upon future business and economic factors, among other evaluation criteria, and may frequently be beyond the control of management. As a result of these factors, management also provides this information externally, along with a complete reconciliation to their comparable GAAP amounts, so readers have access to the detail and general nature of adjustments made to GAAP results. Descriptions of the special items are provided in the schedules accompanying the press release.
Management believes that Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer and Verizon Wireless's operating income before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and EBITDA margin, additional non-GAAP financial measures, are also useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating financial performance. Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer is determined by subtracting equipment and other revenue from Verizon Wireless's cost of sales and services and selling, general and administrative expenses, divided by average customers during the period. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA is determined by adding-back depreciation and amortization to operating income and the Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Verizon Wireless's EBITDA by Verizon Wireless's service revenues. Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer, EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP operating performance measures that are used internally to evaluate current operating expense efficiency and operating profitability on a more variable cost basis by excluding the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions (particularly customer base amortization) that occurred in prior years. Cash expense per customer is determined by reflecting equipment and other revenue on a net cost basis in order to illustrate the impact of the net cost of selling handsets and other equipment to the customers and other similar transactions with customers. In addition, Verizon management uses this information to evaluate operating performance in relation to Verizon Wireless's competitors. The Verizon Wireless EBITDA margin utilizes service revenues rather than total revenues. Service revenues exclude primarily equipment revenues (as well as other non-service revenues) in order to capture the impact of providing service to the wireless customer base on an ongoing basis. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA margin is presented along with Verizon Wireless's operating income margin so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on it than the corresponding GAAP measure. Management believes that this presentation assists readers in preparing comparisons of this type of performance measure (operating profitability) using the GAAP measure as well as the measure management uses to evaluate segment results and perform comparisons to other wireless carriers.
It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial statements and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

for reconciliations to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for non-GAAP financial measures cited in this news release. Discontinued operations relate to the disposition of Telecomunicaciones de Puerto Rico, Inc. that was completed on March 30, 2007. Reclassifications of prior-period amounts have been made, where appropriate, to reflect comparable operating results for the spinoff of the Wireline segment's non-strategic local exchange and related business assets in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont in the first quarter of 2008.
Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) today reported that it continued to grow sales of broadband, wireless and strategic business services in the fourth quarter 2008. Strong customer and revenue growth contributed to 43 cents in diluted earnings per share (EPS) in the quarter, compared with 37 cents per share in the fourth quarter 2007.
NEW YORK 
On an adjusted basis (non-GAAP), fourth-quarter 2008 EPS was 61 cents, compared with 62 cents in the fourth quarter 2007.
On an annual basis, Verizon reported $2.26 in 2008 EPS from continuing operations, compared with $1.90 in 2007. On an adjusted annual basis, 2008 EPS from continuing operations was $2.54, a 7.6 percent increase, compared with 2007 EPS of $2.36.
"Verizon has shown that it is able to compete effectively in this economic environment," said Chairman and CEO Ivan Seidenberg. "We grew profits and maintained strong cash flows throughout 2008. In the fourth quarter, we continued to produce top-line growth, fueled by strong sales volumes for broadband, wireless and strategic business services.
"The Verizon story in 2008 was one of customer growth and product innovation, based on the strategic technology and broadband infrastructure investments we have made year after

year," Seidenberg said. "We have built a solid foundation to continue to create value for our customers and shareholders in 2009 and beyond."
Verizon's total operating revenues grew 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter 2008, increasing to $24.6 billion from $23.8 billion in the fourth quarter 2007. After adjusting for the spinoff of non-strategic local exchange and related Wireline business assets early in 2008 (non-GAAP), this represents an increase of 4.6 percent. Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter 2008 increased 1.9 percent to $20.8 billion, or 4.1 percent on an adjusted basis, compared with the fourth quarter 2007.
For 2008, annual operating revenues were $97.4 billion, an increase of 4.2 percent from 2007 on a reported basis and 5.1 percent on an adjusted basis. Operating expenses totaled $80.5 billion in 2008, an increase of 3.3 percent from 2007 on a reported basis and 4.2 percent on an adjusted basis.
Cash flows from operations totaled $26.6 billion in 2008, compared with $25.7 billion in 2007. Dividends and share repurchases totaled $6.4 billion in 2008. Capital expenditures totaled $17.2 billion in 2008, compared with $17.5 billion in 2007. For 2009, Verizon is targeting capital spending, excluding amounts related to the acquisition of Alltel Corporation, to be less than the 2008 total.
At year-end 2008, total debt was $52.0 billion, compared with $44.8 billion at the end of the third quarter 2008. Verizon ended 2008 with $9.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, most of which was held for use in completing the acquisition of Alltel in January 2009.
