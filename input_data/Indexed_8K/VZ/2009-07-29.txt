On July 27, 2009, during the webcast of its quarterly earnings report, John F. Killian, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon), provided an update on certain of Verizon's expected operations in the second half of 2009. In his presentation, Mr. Killian stated that:
 
 
Management indicated that the business will continue to be very disciplined in terms of capital allocation and spending in order to maximize free cash flow. Verizon expects that its capital expenditures in 2009 excluding Alltel-related capital will be at least $500 million less than its capital expenditures in 2008, and that its 2009 capital expenditures including Alltel-related capital will be in the range of $17.4 billion to $17.8 billion.
