On October 26, 2009, Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon) issued a press release and financial tables relating to its results for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 (see Exhibit 99).
Non-GAAP Measures
Verizon's press release and financial tables include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.
The consolidated statements of income before special items eliminate items of revenues, expenses, gains and losses primarily as a result of their non-operational or non-recurring nature. These adjustments also include the prior periods' operating revenues and operating expenses of non-strategic local exchange and related business assets in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont that were spun off in the prior year-to-date period, which were determined using specific information where available and allocations where data is not maintained on a state-specific basis within Verizon's books and records. Management believes this presentation of operating performance assists readers in better understanding our results of operations and trends from period to period, consistent with management's evaluation of Verizon's consolidated and segment results of operations for a variety of internal purposes including strategic business planning, capital allocation and compensation. Management believes that the consolidated statements of income before special items provide current and prior period results of operations on a comparable basis as well as provide trends that are more indicative of future operating results than GAAP results of operations, given the non-operational or non-recurring nature of the special items removed for purposes of reporting results of operations before special items. While some of these items have been periodically reported in Verizon's consolidated results of operations, their occurrence in future periods is dependent upon future business and economic factors, among other factors, and may frequently be beyond the control of management. As a result of these factors, management also provides this information externally, along with a complete reconciliation to their comparable GAAP amounts, so readers have access to the detail and general nature of adjustments made to GAAP results. Descriptions of the special items are provided in the schedules accompanying the press release.
Management believes that Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer and Verizon Wireless's operating income before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and EBITDA service margin, additional non-GAAP financial measures, are also useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating financial performance. Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer, EBITDA and EBITDA service margin are non-GAAP operating performance measures that are used internally to evaluate current operating expense efficiency and operating profitability on a more variable cost basis by excluding the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions (particularly customer base amortization) that occurred in prior years. In addition, Verizon management uses this information to evaluate operating performance in relation to Verizon Wireless's competitors. Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer is determined by subtracting equipment and other revenue from Verizon Wireless's cost of sales and services and selling, general and administrative expenses and dividing the result, by average customers during the period. Cash expense per customer is determined by reflecting equipment and other revenue on a net cost basis in order to illustrate the impact of the net cost of selling handsets and other equipment to the customers and other similar transactions with customers. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA is determined by adding-back depreciation and amortization to operating income; and the Verizon Wireless EBITDA service margin is calculated by dividing Verizon Wireless's EBITDA by Verizon Wireless's service revenues. The Verizon Wireless EBITDA service margin utilizes service revenues rather than total revenues. Service revenues exclude primarily equipment revenues (as well as other non-service revenues) in order to capture the impact of providing service to the wireless customer base on an ongoing basis. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA service margin is presented along with Verizon Wireless's operating income margin so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on it than the corresponding GAAP measure. Management believes that this presentation assists readers in preparing comparisons of this type of performance measure (operating profitability) using the GAAP measure as well as the measure management uses to evaluate segment results and perform comparisons to other wireless carriers.
Verizon's Free Cash Flow is an additional non-GAAP financial measure that is useful to investors and other users of its financial information in evaluating the Company's cash available to pay debt and dividends. Free Cash Flow is an indication of how much cash is generated by normal business operations, after capital expenditures. Management believes this presentation is consistent with its evaluation of internal measures, including strategic business planning and capital allocation. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from cash flow from operations.
The unaudited pro forma financial information gives the pro forma effect to the acquisition of Alltel Corporation as if that acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2008 and presents the combined pro forma operating results of Verizon and Alltel Corporation on a comparable basis, before special items. The unaudited pro forma results are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect the realization of potential cost savings and any related integration costs. Certain cost savings may result from the merger, however, there can be no assurance that these cost savings will be achieved. Cost savings, if achieved, could result from, among other things, the reduction of overhead expenses, including employee levels and the elimination of duplicate facilities and capital expenditures. These pro forma results do not purport to be indicative of the results that would have actually been obtained if the merger had occurred as of January 1, 2008, nor does the pro forma data intend to be a projection of the results that may be obtained in the future.
Management believes this presentation of pro forma financial information before special items assists readers in better understanding our results of operations and trends from period to period, consistent with management's evaluation of Verizon's consolidated and segment results of operations for a variety of internal measures. Management believes that the pro forma financial information provides current and prior period results of operations on a comparable basis as well as provides trends that are more indicative of future operating results than GAAP results of operations, given the acquisition during the period and the non-operational or non-recurring nature of the special items removed for purposes of reporting results of operations before special items. Management provides this information externally, along with a reconciliation to their comparable GAAP amounts, so readers have access to the detail and general nature of adjustments made to GAAP results. Descriptions of these special items are provided in the schedules accompanying the press release.
It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial statements and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Verizon News Release, page 2
Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) generated strong and improved cash flow in the third quarter 2009, with continued revenue and customer growth in wireless and broadband markets.
NEW YORK 
Verizon today reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 41 cents in the third quarter, compared with 59 cents per share in the third quarter 2008. On an adjusted basis (non-GAAP), Verizon posted EPS of 60 cents in the third quarter 2009, compared with 66 cents in the third quarter 2008.
Verizon's total operating revenues grew 10.2 percent to $27.3 billion, compared with the third quarter 2008. This includes revenues from Alltel Corporation, which Verizon acquired in January 2009. On a pro forma basis (consolidating the operating results of Verizon and the former Alltel as though the acquisition had occurred on Jan. 1, 2008), operating revenue growth was 0.6 percent.
Cash flow from operations totaled $23.1 billion for the first nine months of 2009, up 16.0 percent, or $3.2 billion, over the same period last year. Free cash flow (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures) totaled $10.7 billion, up $3.3 billion over the same period last year. Verizon paid shareowners $3.9 billion in dividends during the first three quarters of 2009, and its Board of Directors approved a 3.3 percent quarterly dividend increase last month.
"Verizon continues to generate strong cash flow, which we have used in building the foundation for sustainable, long-term shareowner value," said Verizon Chairman and CEO Ivan Seidenberg. "Even through the worst of the recession, we have continued to raise our dividend

and to add new customers, expand markets and grow revenues based on the power and innovation of Verizon's wireless, broadband and global networks."
He added, "The Verizon network is now an engine for next-generation communications services that will create new short- and long-term opportunities for us. As the U.S. economic and employment picture improves, and as we accelerate reductions in our own cost structure, we are well-positioned to quickly and significantly improve our growth profile."
Seidenberg also noted that a simplified organizational structure announced earlier this month will enable Verizon to achieve improved levels of productivity. The realignment has combined two former Wireline business groups, Verizon Telecom and Verizon Business, into one organization.
Verizon Wireless continued to lead the industry with the highest profit margins. In the third quarter 2009:

In addition to strong Wireless results, Verizon posted another quarter of gains in the number of customers using fiber-optic-based FiOS Internet and FiOS TV services. In consumer markets served by Verizon's wireline network, increased revenues from broadband and video services helped produce overall revenue growth, as well as ARPU growth. In the third quarter:

Adjusted earnings in the third quarter 2009 excluded 19 cents per share in special items: 13 cents for severance, pension and benefit charges in connection with pension settlements related to previously announced force reductions; 4 cents for merger integration and acquisition costs primarily in connection with the Alltel transaction; and 2 cents for costs related to the pending spinoff of non-strategic Wireline access lines. Third-quarter 2008 adjusted earnings excluded 7 cents per share in special items: 6 cents for severance, pension and benefit charges; and 1 cent for merger integration costs in connection with Verizon's acquisition of MCI in 2006.
