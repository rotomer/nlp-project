Attached as an exhibit hereto is a press release and financial tables dated January 26, 2010 issued by Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon).
Non-GAAP Measures
Verizon's press release and financial tables include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.
The consolidated statements of income before special items eliminate items of revenues, expenses, gains and losses primarily as a result of their non-operational or non-recurring nature. These adjustments also include the prior periods' operating revenues and operating expenses of non-strategic local exchange and related business assets in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont that were spun off in the prior year-to-date period, which were determined using specific information where available and allocations where data is not maintained on a state-specific basis within Verizon's books and records. Management believes this presentation of operating performance assists readers in better understanding our results of operations and trends from period to period, consistent with management's evaluation of Verizon's consolidated and segment results of operations for a variety of internal purposes including strategic business planning, capital allocation and compensation. Management believes that the consolidated statements of income before special items provide current and prior period results of operations on a comparable basis as well as provide trends that are more indicative of future operating results than GAAP results of operations, given the non-operational or non-recurring nature of the special items removed for purposes of reporting results of operations before special items. While some of these items have been periodically reported in Verizon's consolidated results of operations, their occurrence in future periods is dependent upon future business and economic factors, among other factors, and may frequently be beyond the control of management. As a result of these factors, management also provides this information externally, along with a complete reconciliation to their comparable GAAP amounts, so readers have access to the detail and general nature of adjustments made to GAAP results. Descriptions of the special items are provided in the schedules accompanying the press release.
Management believes that Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer and Verizon Wireless's operating income before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and EBITDA service margin, additional non-GAAP financial measures, are also useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating financial performance. Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer, EBITDA and EBITDA service margin are non-GAAP operating performance measures that are used internally to evaluate current operating expense efficiency and operating profitability on a more variable cost basis by excluding the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions (particularly customer base amortization) that occurred in prior years. In addition, Verizon management uses this information to evaluate operating performance in relation to Verizon Wireless's competitors. Verizon Wireless's cash expense per customer is determined by subtracting equipment and other revenue from Verizon Wireless's cost of sales and services and selling, general and administrative expenses and dividing the result, by average customers during the period. Cash expense per customer is determined by reflecting equipment and other revenue on a net cost basis in order to illustrate the impact of the net cost of selling handsets and other equipment to the customers and other similar transactions with customers. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA is determined by adding-back depreciation and amortization to operating income; and the Verizon Wireless EBITDA service margin is calculated by dividing Verizon Wireless's EBITDA by Verizon Wireless's service revenues. The Verizon Wireless EBITDA service margin utilizes service revenues rather than total revenues. Service revenues exclude primarily equipment revenues (as well as other non-service revenues) in order to capture the impact of providing service to the wireless customer base on an ongoing basis. Verizon Wireless's EBITDA service margin is presented along with Verizon Wireless's operating income margin so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on it than the corresponding GAAP measure. Management believes that this presentation assists readers in preparing comparisons of this type of performance measure (operating profitability) using the GAAP measure as well as the measure management uses to evaluate segment results and perform comparisons to other wireless carriers.
Verizon's Free Cash Flow is an additional non-GAAP financial measure that is useful to investors and other users of its financial information in evaluating the Company's cash available to pay debt and dividends. Free Cash Flow is an indication of how much cash is generated by business operations, after capital expenditures. Management believes this presentation is consistent with its evaluation of internal measures, including strategic business planning and capital allocation. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from cash flow from operations.
The unaudited pro forma financial information gives the pro forma effect to the acquisition of Alltel Corporation as if that acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2008 and presents the combined pro forma operating results of Verizon and Alltel Corporation on a comparable basis, before special items. The unaudited pro forma results are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect the realization of potential cost savings and any related integration costs. Certain cost savings may result from the merger, however, there can be no assurance that these cost savings will be achieved. Cost savings, if achieved, could result from, among other things, the reduction of overhead expenses, including employee levels and the elimination of duplicate facilities and capital expenditures. These pro forma results do not purport to be indicative of the results that would have actually been obtained if the merger had occurred as of January 1, 2008, nor does the pro forma data intend to be a projection of the results that may be obtained in the future.
Management believes this presentation of pro forma financial information before special items assists readers in better understanding our results of operations and trends from period to period, consistent with management's evaluation of Verizon's consolidated and segment results of operations for a variety of internal measures. Management believes that the pro forma financial information provides current and prior period results of operations on a comparable basis as well as provides trends that are more indicative of future operating results than GAAP results of operations, given the acquisition during the period and the non-operational or non-recurring nature of the special items removed for purposes of reporting results of operations before special items. Management provides this information externally, along with reconciliation to their comparable GAAP amounts so readers have access to the detail and general nature of adjustments made to GAAP results. Descriptions of these special items are provided in the schedules accompanying the press release.
It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial statements and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Verizon News Release, page 2
Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) today reported continued strong cash flow in the fourth quarter 2009, fueled by quarterly growth in strategic areas. Verizon Wireless added a net of 2.2 million total customers, including 1.2 million retail customers, and reported increased data revenue. Verizon's wireline operations posted customer and revenue gains in FiOS broadband services and increased sales of strategic business services.
NEW YORK 
In the fourth quarter, Verizon recorded a loss of 23 cents in diluted earnings per share (EPS), compared with EPS of 43 cents per share in the fourth quarter 2008. Contributing to the loss was a special item of $3.0 billion in pre-tax costs related to workforce reductions. On an adjusted basis (non-GAAP), fourth-quarter 2009 EPS was 54 cents, compared with 61 cents in the fourth quarter 2008.
On an annual basis, Verizon reported $1.29 in 2009 EPS, compared with $2.26 in 2008. On an adjusted basis, full-year 2009 EPS was $2.40, compared with 2008 EPS of $2.54.
"In last year's turbulent economy, we took significant steps to strengthen Verizon going forward," said Chairman and CEO Ivan Seidenberg. "We focused on expanding wireless data and set the stage to deploy a nationwide 4G network later this year. We also expanded the scale of FiOS and our global IP network. We saw growth in all these areas in 2009, and we expect continued growth in 2010 and beyond, with a goal of delivering long-term shareowner value."
In the fourth quarter, Verizon continued streamlining its wireline operations. The company also incurred costs in preparation for the spinoff of wireline access lines to Frontier Communications, a transaction that Seidenberg said was on track to close in the second quarter of 2010.

Seidenberg added: "Our fourth-quarter earnings reflect costs to re-size and simplify our wireline business. This transformation is realigning our wireline cost structure, improving productivity, and focusing resources on sales of FiOS and strategic business services. Verizon Wireless also underwent a successful transformation in 2009. Our customer base moved more toward data-centric devices and services, and we are successfully integrating Alltel operations and capturing merger synergies."
In the fourth quarter 2009, Verizon's total operating revenues grew 9.9 percent to $27.1 billion, compared with the fourth quarter 2008. This includes revenues from Alltel, which Verizon acquired in January 2009. On a pro forma basis (consolidating the operating results of Verizon and the former Alltel as though the acquisition had occurred on Jan. 1, 2008), fourth-quarter 2009 operating revenue growth was 0.2 percent, compared with the fourth quarter 2008.
For 2009, annual operating revenues totaled $107.8 billion, an increase of 10.7 percent from 2008 on a reported basis and 1.5 percent on a pro forma basis.
Cash flow from operations totaled $31.6 billion in 2009, up 14.5 percent, or $4.0 billion, from 2008. Free cash flow (non-GAAP; cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) totaled $14.5 billion in 2009, up $4.2 billion from 2008. Verizon's capital expenditures were $17.0 billion in 2009, compared with $17.2 billion in 2008.
Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter 2009 excluded 77 cents per share in special items: 66 cents for severance, pension and benefit charges in connection with workforce reductions in the fourth quarter and continuing into 2010; 2 cents for merger integration and acquisition costs
Verizon News Release, page 4
primarily in connection with the Alltel transaction; and 9 cents for other charges, including costs related to the pending spinoff of non-strategic wireline access lines.
Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter 2008 excluded 15 cents per share for severance, pension and benefit related charges; 1 cent per share for merger integration costs; and 1 cent per share for an other-than-temporary decline in investment values.
Verizon announced today that, in future quarterly earnings reports, the company will no longer adjust reported results for non-operational or special items. However, the company will continue to provide information to help investors understand reported results on a comparable basis with historical periods.
Verizon Wireless delivered sustained high margins and solid customer growth. In the fourth quarter 2009:

In wireline, Verizon posted another consecutive quarter of gains in the number of customers using fiber-optic-based FiOS Internet and FiOS TV services. In consumer markets served by Verizon's wireline network, increased revenues from broadband and video services again helped produce overall revenue growth, as well as ARPU growth.

for reconciliations to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for non-GAAP financial measures cited in this news release. Reclassifications of prior-period amounts have been made in accordance with the adoption of the accounting standard on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements and, where appropriate, to reflect comparable operating results for the spinoff of the Wireline segment's non-strategic local exchange and related business assets in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont in the first quarter of 2008. Unless stated otherwise, segment results shown are adjusted for special items. Adjusted EPS is calculated based on net income attributable to Verizon before special items, which eliminates items of revenues, expenses, gains and losses primarily as a result of their non-operational or non-recurring nature.
