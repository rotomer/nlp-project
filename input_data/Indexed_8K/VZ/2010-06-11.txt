As discussed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2010, in April 2010, we reached an agreement with certain unions on temporary enhancements to the separation programs contained in their existing collective bargaining agreements. These temporary enhancements were intended to help address a previously declared surplus of employees and to help reduce the need for layoffs. Certain of the employees eligible for the temporary enhancement offer are still considering whether to accept the offer, which expires in June. Based on the acceptance rates that have been experienced thus far, we expect to record a significant, one-time charge related to the offer during the second quarter of 2010. These actions are also expected to result in ongoing cost savings.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
