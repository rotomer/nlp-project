Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Attached as an exhibit hereto are a press release and financial tables dated July 23, 2010 issued by Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon).
Non-GAAP Measures
Verizon's press release and financial tables include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial information and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.
Verizon consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Consolidated EBITDA), Verizon Wireless Segment EBITDA (Wireless EBITDA), Verizon Wireless Segment EBITDA service margin (Wireless EBITDA service margin), Verizon Wireline Segment EBITDA (Wireline EBITDA) and Verizon Wireline Segment EBITDA margin (Wireline EBITDA margin) are non-GAAP measures and do not purport to be alternatives to GAAP items as measures of operating performance. Management believes that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to Verizon's competitors. Wireless EBITDA service margin and Wireline EBITDA margin are presented along with the respective corresponding operating income margin so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on it than the corresponding GAAP measure.
Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses, equity in earnings of unconsolidated businesses and other income/(expense), net to net income.
Wireless EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expenses to Verizon Wireless operating income, and Wireless EBITDA service margin is calculated by dividing Wireless EBITDA by Verizon Wireless service revenues. Wireless EBITDA service margin utilizes service revenues rather than total revenues. Service revenues exclude primarily equipment revenues (as well as other non-service revenues) in order to capture the impact of providing service to the wireless customer base on an ongoing basis.
Wireline EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expenses to Verizon Wireline operating income, and Wireline EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Wireline EBITDA by total Wireline revenues.
Verizon Wireless monthly cash expense per customer is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating current operating expense efficiency, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to Verizon Wireless' competitors. Verizon Wireless monthly cash expense per customer is calculated by subtracting equipment and other revenue from Verizon Wireless cost of sales and services and selling, general and administrative expenses and dividing the result by average customers during the period. As a result, monthly cash expense per customer reflects equipment and other revenue on a net cost basis in order to illustrate the impact of the net cost of selling handsets and other equipment to customers and other similar transactions with customers.
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is useful to investors and other users of Verizon's financial information in evaluating cash available to pay debt and dividends. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from cash flow from operations.
Net debt and the ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating Verizon's leverage. Net debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt. For purposes of the ratio of Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA is the sum of the consolidated EBITDA amounts for the last 12 months adjusted to exclude the effect of non-operational and/or non-recurring items. Management believes this presentation assists investors in understanding trends that are more indicative of future operating results than GAAP results of operations, given the non-operational and/or non-recurring nature of the items excluded from the calculation.

For second-quarter 2010, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, NASDAQ: VZ) reported continued strong cash flow growth, coupled with improved margins for both its Wireless and Wireline business segments, and improved revenue trends for sales to global business customers.
NEW YORK 
The company reported a loss of 7 cents in basic earnings per share (EPS) in the quarter, which included $2.3 billion in pre-tax costs for workforce reductions associated with a second-quarter incentive offer that will lead to approximately 11,000 voluntary separations this year. This compares with earnings of 52 cents per share in the second quarter of 2009.
"Verizon showed solid improvement in operational results in the quarter," said Chairman and CEO Ivan Seidenberg. "In addition, the wireline spinoff to Frontier on July 1 improves our future growth profile. We see the opportunity to create additional shareholder value with a revenue portfolio that is now more heavily focused on wireless, FiOS and global IP."
Seidenberg added, "We have the network platforms in place, and the product and service innovations in the pipeline, to fuel the next generation of growth in our changing industry. Our cost-reduction efforts are gaining momentum, and trends in the global business market are showing signs of stabilization."

Verizon's consolidated second-quarter 2010 results include wireline local exchange businesses covering 4 million access lines that were spun off and merged with Frontier Communications on July 1. Results also include certain wireless properties until they were divested in April and June to comply with conditions imposed in connection with regulatory approvals of last year's acquisition of Alltel. These wireless properties, covering more than 2 million customers, were held in a trust through the date of divestiture.
Items that negatively impacted Verizon's second-quarter 2010 net income were 52 cents per share associated with the voluntary incentive program for union-represented employees, about two-thirds of whom left the payroll in late June or early July; 6 cents per share for both Alltel merger integration costs and taxes associated with the divestiture of the Alltel trust properties; 4 cents per share in Frontier spinoff-related charges; and 3 cents per share for a one-time, non-cash revenue adjustment of $268 million, which was recorded to properly defer previously recognized wireless data revenues that will be earned and recognized in future periods.
Verizon's total operating revenues were $26.8 billion in second-quarter 2010, a decrease of 0.3 percent compared with second-quarter 2009.
Cash flow from operations totaled $16.9 billion in the first half of 2010, compared with $14.1 billion in the first half of 2009. Cash flow from operations totaled $9.8 billion in second-quarter 2010 alone, up 29.8 percent compared with second-quarter 2009.
Capital expenditures totaled $4.2 billion in the second quarter of 2010, down 3.6 percent from second-quarter 2009. Full-year 2010 guidance for capital expenditures remains in the range of $16.8 billion to $17.2 billion. In second-quarter 2010, free cash flow (non-GAAP; cash flow

from operations less capital expenditures) totaled $5.5 billion, a 76.7 percent year-over-year increase.
Verizon's net debt (non-GAAP; total debt less end-of-period cash and cash equivalents) was $52.7 billion at the end of second-quarter 2010. The net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio (non-GAAP; net debt divided by earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted for non-recurring or one-time items) was approximately 1.5 at the end of the quarter, and Verizon expects it to be lower by year-end 2010.
Verizon Wireless continued to deliver strong margins and data revenue growth, and solid customer additions. In the second quarter of 2010:

Verizon continued to add customers for broadband and video services provided over its FiOS fiber-optic network, and revenues increased for advanced communications and related business services provided over Verizon's global IP (Internet protocol) network. In the second quarter of 2010:
