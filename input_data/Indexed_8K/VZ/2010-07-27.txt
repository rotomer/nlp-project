On a July 23, 2010 conference call with financial analysts and investors, John F. Killian, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon), discussed Verizon's second quarter 2010 results and its outlook for the remainder of 2010.
-Verizon's earnings per share (EPS) in the first half of 2010 adjusted for the impact of non-operational and one-time items was $1.13. Assets related to the spin-off to Frontier Communications and the overlapping properties divested as a condition to the acquisition of Alltel Corporation accounted for approximately $0.12 of EPS in the first half of 2010 and Verizon estimates that adjusted EPS for the second half of 2010 will be approximately 5 to 10 percent higher than the adjusted base of $1.01, which excludes those properties. (Adjusted EPS is calculated based on adding back the EPS impact of non-operational and/or non-recurring items to reported EPS.)
-Verizon expects that Wireless revenue and retail postpaid ARPU growth on a year-over-year basis will continue in the second half of 2010. Verizon also expects that Wireless will continue strong EBITDA margin performance in the second half of 2010.
-Verizon expects that Wireline's EBITDA margin for the properties remaining following the Frontier Communications transaction will improve in the second half of 2010 on a comparable basis from the first half of 2010 as a result of force reductions and other cost reduction initiatives.
-Verizon reiterates its full-year 2010 guidance that capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $16.8 billion to $17.2 billion and expects that consolidated capital expenditures and capital expenditures for Wireline will be lower in 2011 than in 2010.
-Verizon continues to expect that Wireless will begin providing 4G Long-Term Evolution service in 25 to 30 markets by the end of 2010.
