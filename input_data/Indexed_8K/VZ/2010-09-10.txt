In order to comply with regulatory conditions related to the acquisition of Alltel Corporation in January 2009, Cellco Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless divested overlapping properties in 105 operating markets in 24 states during the first half of 2010. In addition, on July 1, 2010, certain of Verizon Communications Inc.'s (Verizon) local exchange and related landline assets in 14 states were spun off.
As a convenience to investors who may want to consider the effects of these transactions, we are making available in Exhibit 99 unaudited historical financial and operating information for the past six quarters reflecting the reclassification of the results associated with these divested properties from the respective Domestic Wireless and Wireline segment operating results, as well as the impact on those results of the deferred revenue adjustment that was disclosed in Verizon's Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2010. This information is also posted to the Verizon Investor Relations website at www.verizon.com/investor.
The information provided pursuant to this Item 7.01 is "furnished" and shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the Securities and Exchange Commission or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in any such filings.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
