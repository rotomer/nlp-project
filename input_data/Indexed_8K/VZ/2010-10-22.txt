Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Attached as an exhibit hereto are a press release and financial tables dated October 22, 2010 issued by Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon).
Non-GAAP Measures
Verizon's press release and financial tables include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial information and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.
Consolidated adjusted operating revenues is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating results and understanding operating trends. Consolidated adjusted operating revenues exclude the operating revenues associated with the Wireless and Wireline properties divested in 2010 from prior periods.
Verizon consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Consolidated adjusted EBITDA), Verizon Wireless Segment EBITDA (Wireless EBITDA), Verizon Wireless Segment EBITDA service margin (Wireless EBITDA service margin), Verizon Wireline Segment EBITDA (Wireline EBITDA) and Verizon Wireline Segment EBITDA margin (Wireline EBITDA margin) are non-GAAP measures and do not purport to be alternatives to GAAP items as measures of operating performance. Management believes that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to Verizon's competitors. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA, Wireless EBITDA, Wireless EBITDA service margin, Wireline EBITDA and Wireline EBITDA margin are presented along with the respective operating income and operating income margins so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on them than the corresponding GAAP measures.
Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses, equity in earnings of unconsolidated businesses and other income/(expense), net to net income. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding the effect of non-operational or non-recurring items and the impact of divested operations from the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA.
Wireless EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expenses to Verizon Wireless operating income, and Wireless EBITDA service margin is calculated by dividing Wireless EBITDA by Verizon Wireless service revenues. Wireless EBITDA service margin utilizes service revenues rather than total revenues. Service revenues primarily exclude equipment revenues (as well as other non-service revenues) in order to capture the impact of providing service to the wireless customer base on an ongoing basis.
Wireline EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expenses to Verizon Wireline operating income, and Wireline EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Wireline EBITDA by total Wireline revenues.
Verizon Wireless monthly cash expense per customer is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating current operating expense efficiency, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to Verizon Wireless' competitors. Verizon Wireless monthly cash expense per customer is calculated by subtracting equipment and other revenue from Verizon Wireless cost of sales and services and selling, general and administrative expenses and dividing the result by average customers during the period. As a result, monthly cash expense per customer reflects equipment and other revenue on a net cost basis in order to illustrate the impact of the net cost of selling handsets and other equipment to customers and other similar transactions with customers.
Verizon Wireline cash operating expense is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating Verizon Wireline's operating performance. Verizon Wireline cash operating expense is calculated by subtracting depreciation and amortization expense from total Verizon Wireline operating expense.
Adjusted Earnings per Share (Adjusted EPS) is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is useful to investors in evaluating our operating results and understanding our operating trends. Adjusted EPS is calculated by excluding the impact of divested operations and adding back the EPS impact of non-operational or non-recurring items to reported EPS.
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is useful to investors and other users of Verizon's financial information in evaluating cash available to pay debt and dividends. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from cash flow from operations.
Net debt and the ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating Verizon's leverage. Net debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt. For purposes of the ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the last 12 months. Management believes this presentation assists investors in understanding trends that are more indicative of future operating results given the non-operational or non-recurring nature of the items excluded from the calculation.

-- Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, NASDAQ: VZ) today reported continued strong cash flow in the third quarter 2010, and earnings and margin improvements compared with the second quarter 2010. In the third quarter, Verizon Wireless, FiOS and strategic business services produced continued strong revenue and customer growth.
NEW YORK
The company reported 31 cents in EPS in third-quarter 2010, compared with 41 cents per share in third-quarter 2009. Third-quarter 2010 results included 25 cents per share in non-operational charges, the largest of which was a non-cash charge related to pension settlements.
"Verizon built on a strong second quarter with a stronger third quarter, resulting in improved earnings performance and substantial cash flow," said Chairman and CEO Ivan Seidenberg. "We are building momentum and are on track to achieve our goal of growing earnings in the second half of the year. We are excited by the opportunities we see to expand wireline margins and the growth we see related to the upcoming launch of next-generation wireless services."
Verizon anticipates that adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) in second-half 2010 will be at the high end of the range of its guidance. Based on adjusted EPS of $1.01 in the first half of the year, Verizon estimates second-half 2010 adjusted EPS will be approximately 5 percent to 10 percent greater than $1.01. (Adjusted EPS is calculated based on excluding the impact of divested properties and adding back the EPS impact of non-operational and/or non-recurring items to reported EPS.)
Verizon News Release, page 3
 
 
Seidenberg added, "We are confident in the long-term potential of our business and in our ability to return long-term value to shareowners."
In third-quarter 2010, Verizon's Board of Directors approved a 2.6 percent quarterly dividend increase, and shareowners realized $1.85 per share in additional returns as a result of Verizon's transaction with Frontier Communications.
On a consolidated basis, Verizon's total operating revenues were $26.5 billion in third-quarter 2010, a decrease of 2.9 percent compared with third-quarter 2009. Last year's results included revenues from operations that have since been divested.
On a comparable basis (non-GAAP), third-quarter 2010 total operating revenues increased $550 million, or 2.1 percent, compared with third-quarter 2009. This is an acceleration from year-over-year comparable revenue growth of 0.5 percent in second-quarter 2010.
Cash flow from operations totaled $25.2 billion through the first three quarters of 2010, compared with $23.1 billion through the first three quarters of 2009. Cash flow from operations totaled $8.3 billion in third-quarter 2010 alone.
Capital expenditures totaled $11.8 billion through the first three quarters of 2010, down 4.9 percent compared with $12.4 billion through the first three quarters of 2009. Verizon expects that total capital spending for 2010 will be at the low end of, or slightly below, the company's targeted range of $16.8 billion to $17.2 billion.
Through the first three quarters of 2010, free cash flow (non-GAAP; cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) totaled $13.4 billion, a 25.3 percent year-over-year increase.
Verizon's net debt (non-GAAP; total debt less cash and cash equivalents) was $47.8 billion at the end of third-quarter 2010. The net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio (non-
Verizon News Release, page 4
 
GAAP; net debt divided by earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of divested operations and non-recurring or non-operational items) was approximately 1.4 at the end of the quarter, and Verizon continues to expect it to be lower by year-end 2010.
Non-operational items that negatively impacted Verizon's third-quarter 2010 net income by 25 cents per share were: 19 cents per share for the non-cash recognition of pension settlement losses resulting from the company's workforce reduction and voluntary separation plans; 4 cents per share for charges in connection with the closing of the Frontier transaction; and 2 cents per share for Alltel merger integration costs.
Verizon also reported that the full-year 2010 adjusted effective tax rate attributable to Verizon will be in the range of 31 percent to 32 percent, down from previous guidance in the range of 33 percent to 35 percent.
Verizon Wireless delivered accelerating top-line revenue growth, continued data revenue growth, strong margins, and solid additions of traditional customers and other connections. In the third quarter of 2010:
