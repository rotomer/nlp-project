On January 21, 2011, Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon) issued a press release announcing a change to its method of accounting for pension and other post-employment benefits, which is provided as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. Historically, Verizon has recognized actuarial gains and losses as a component of Equity in its consolidated balance sheets on an annual basis, amortizing them into operating results generally over the average future service period of active employees in these plans. During the fourth quarter of 2010, Verizon elected to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in its operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur. This change is intended to improve the transparency of Verizon's operational performance by recognizing the effects of current economic and interest rate trends on plan investments and assumptions. These gains and losses are generally measured annually as of December 31st and, accordingly, are recorded during the fourth quarter. Additionally, Verizon will no longer calculate expected return on plan assets using an averaging technique permitted under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for the market-related value of plan assets but instead will use actual fair value of plan assets. Verizon has applied this change retrospectively, adjusting prior periods.
Verizon's operating segment results follow internal management reporting which is used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Historically, total benefit cost was allocated to each segment. As part of this change to its method of accounting, the service cost and the amortization of prior service costs, which are representative of the benefits earned by active employees during the period, will continue to be allocated to the segment in which the employee is employed, while interest cost and expected return on assets will now be recorded at the Corporate level. The recognition of actuarial gains and losses will also be recorded at the Corporate level. Verizon has adjusted prior-period segment information to conform to this presentation.
As a convenience to investors who may want to consider the effects of this change in accounting, we are making available in Exhibit 99.2 unaudited historical consolidated and wireline segment financial information for the past 7 quarters.
 
(d) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
NEWS RELEASE
 
 
 
Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, NASDAQ:VZ) announced today that it has adopted a new policy that changes the method of accounting for pensions and other post-employment benefits (OPEB). The improved policy recognizes gains and losses in the year they are incurred, rather than amortizing them over time.
NEW YORK 
Under the new method, annual adjustments will be made to reflect actual return on pension plan assets, changes in discount rates and differences from other actuarial assumptions.
There is no impact on cash flow or pension funding requirements as a result of this change, and there is no change to Verizon's pension or OPEB liability. In addition, Verizon Wireless is not impacted by this change.
"Our decision to adopt this new accounting policy will make our financial reporting easier to understand and more transparent," said Fran Shammo, Verizon executive vice president

and chief financial officer. "We've been considering this for some time. For us, it was a question of when, not if, we would make this change."
Verizon will report fourth-quarter and full-year 2010 results on Jan. 25, and the company said that the impact of this accounting change will result in cumulative pre-tax charges of $600 million for full-year 2010. This is due primarily to a lower discount rate, partially offset by a return on assets that was higher than expected, and favorable health care trends and other costs.
The company lowered its assumed discount rate, which was 6.25 percent at the end of 2009, to 5.75 percent for purposes of determining its pension and OPEB liability. This change increased the liability by $2.9 billion in 2010. The estimated return on pension assets in 2010 was approximately 14 percent, compared with an assumption of 8.5 percent, resulting in an actuarial gain of approximately $1 billion. Health care and other retiree benefit costs were favorable compared to assumptions, resulting in a $1.3 billion reduction in liabilities.
For 2011, the company said it has lowered its return on pension assets assumption from 8.5 percent to 8.0 percent.
For comparability, Verizon has adjusted quarterly financial information for 2009 and the first three quarters of 2010. These historical results have been posted on Verizon's Investor Relations website, .
