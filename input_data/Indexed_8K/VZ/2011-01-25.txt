Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Attached as an exhibit hereto are a press release and financial tables dated January 25, 2011 issued by Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon).
Non-GAAP Measures
Verizon's press release and financial tables include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial information and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.
Consolidated adjusted operating revenues is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating results and understanding operating trends. Consolidated adjusted operating revenues exclude the operating revenues associated with the Wireless and Wireline properties divested in 2010 from prior periods.
Verizon Wireless Segment earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Wireless EBITDA), Verizon Wireless Segment EBITDA service margin (Wireless EBITDA service margin), Verizon Wireline Segment EBITDA (Wireline EBITDA) and Verizon Wireline Segment EBITDA margin (Wireline EBITDA margin) are non-GAAP measures and do not purport to be alternatives to GAAP items as measures of operating performance. Management believes that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to Verizon's competitors. Wireless EBITDA, Wireless EBITDA service margin, Wireline EBITDA and Wireline EBITDA margin are presented along with the respective operating income and operating income margins so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on them than the corresponding GAAP measures.
Wireless EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expenses to Verizon Wireless operating income, and Wireless EBITDA service margin is calculated by dividing Wireless EBITDA by Verizon Wireless service revenues. Wireless EBITDA service margin utilizes service revenues rather than total revenues. Service revenues primarily exclude equipment revenues (as well as other non-service revenues) in order to capture the impact of providing service to the wireless customer base on an ongoing basis.
Wireline EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expenses to Verizon Wireline operating income, and Wireline EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Wireline EBITDA by total Wireline revenues.
Verizon Wireless monthly cash expense per customer is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating current operating expense efficiency, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to Verizon Wireless' competitors. Verizon Wireless monthly cash expense per customer is calculated by subtracting equipment and other revenue from Verizon Wireless cost of sales and services and selling, general and administrative expenses and dividing the result by average customers during the period. As a result, monthly cash expense per customer reflects equipment and other revenue on a net cost basis in order to illustrate the impact of the net cost of selling handsets and other equipment to customers and other similar transactions with customers.
Verizon Wireline cash operating expense is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating Verizon Wireline's operating performance. Verizon Wireline cash operating expense is calculated by subtracting depreciation and amortization expense from total Verizon Wireline operating expense.
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is useful to investors and other users of Verizon's financial information in evaluating cash available to pay debt and dividends. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from cash flow from operations.

Continued strong cash flow and growth in Verizon Wireless, FiOS and strategic enterprise services highlighted fourth-quarter and year-end 2010 earnings reported today by Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, NASDAQ: VZ).
NEW YORK --
The company reported 93 cents in EPS in fourth-quarter 2010, compared with 22 cents per share (as adjusted) in fourth-quarter 2009. Fourth-quarter 2010 results included 39 cents per share in net non-operational gains: 50 cents per share primarily from the annual actuarial valuation of Verizon's pension assets, partially offset by 6 cents per share for severance and other related charges, and 5 cents per share for Alltel merger integration costs. Fourth-quarter 2009 results included 28 cents per share in non-operational charges.
On an annual basis, Verizon reported 90 cents in 2010 EPS, compared with $1.72 (as adjusted) in 2009.
"Verizon ended 2010 with strong results, driven by solid execution across all our businesses," said Verizon Chairman and CEO Ivan Seidenberg. "The fourth quarter capped a strong second half of the year, resulting in improved earnings, solid momentum and an even stronger balance sheet. Verizon Wireless produced another quarter of impressive growth, with record-high profitability, as we continue to drive higher smartphone adoption and data use.

Following another solid quarter in our wireline businesses, we are optimistic about opportunities to continue to expand wireline margins."
Cash flow from operations totaled $33.4 billion in 2010, compared with $31.4 billion in 2009. Capital expenditures totaled $16.5 billion in 2010, down $400 million from 2009. For 2010, free cash flow (non-GAAP; cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) totaled $16.9 billion, a 16.4 percent year-over-year increase.
On a consolidated basis, Verizon's total operating revenues were $26.4 billion in fourth-quarter 2010, a decrease of 2.6 percent compared with fourth-quarter 2009. Last year's results included revenues from operations that have since been divested.
On a comparable basis (non-GAAP), fourth-quarter 2010 total operating revenues increased $592 million, or 2.3 percent, compared with fourth-quarter 2009.
Verizon Wireless delivered strong growth in revenues, strong retail postpaid ARPU (average monthly service revenue per user), and growth in traditional customers and other connections. Wireless service EBITDA margin was a record high. In the fourth quarter of 2010:

NOTE: Effective with the fourth quarter 2010, Verizon changed its method of accounting for pension and post-employment benefits. Accordingly, all prior periods have been adjusted for this change, which primarily affected Verizon consolidated and the Wireline segment. Reclassifications of prior period amounts have been made, where appropriate, to reflect comparable operating results for the divestiture of overlapping wireless properties in 105 operating markets in 24 states during the first half of 2010; the wireless deferred revenue adjustment that was disclosed in Verizon's Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2010; and the spinoff to Frontier of local exchange and related landline assets in 14 states, effective on July 1, 2010. See the accompanying schedules and for reconciliations to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for non-GAAP financial measures cited in this document.
