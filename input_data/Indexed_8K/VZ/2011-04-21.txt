Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Attached as an exhibit hereto are a press release and financial tables dated April 21, 2011 issued by Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon).
Non-GAAP Measures
Verizon's press release and financial tables include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial information and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.
Consolidated adjusted operating revenues is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating results and understanding operating trends. Consolidated adjusted operating revenues exclude the operating revenues associated with the Wireless and Wireline properties divested in 2010 from prior periods.
Verizon consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Consolidated adjusted EBITDA), Verizon Wireless Segment EBITDA (Wireless EBITDA), Verizon Wireless Segment EBITDA service margin (Wireless EBITDA service margin), Wireline Segment EBITDA (Wireline EBITDA) and Wireline Segment EBITDA margin (Wireline EBITDA margin) are non-GAAP measures and do not purport to be alternatives to GAAP items as measures of operating performance. Management believes that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to Verizon's competitors. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA, Wireless EBITDA, Wireless EBITDA service margin, Wireline EBITDA and Wireline EBITDA margin are presented along with the respective operating income and operating income margins so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on them than the corresponding GAAP measures.
Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses, equity in earnings of unconsolidated businesses and other income/(expense), net to net income. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding the effect of non-operational or non-recurring items and the impact of divested operations from the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA.
Wireless EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expenses to Verizon Wireless operating income, and Wireless EBITDA service margin is calculated by dividing Wireless EBITDA by Verizon Wireless service revenues. Wireless EBITDA service margin utilizes service revenues rather than total revenues. Service revenues primarily exclude equipment revenues (as well as other non-service revenues) in order to capture the impact of providing service to the wireless customer base on an ongoing basis.
Wireline EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expenses to Verizon Wireline operating income, and Wireline EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Wireline EBITDA by total Wireline revenues.
Net Debt and the Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating Verizon's leverage. Net Debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt. For purposes of the Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the last 12 months. Management believes this presentation assists investors in understanding trends that are indicative of future operating results given the non-operational or non-recurring nature of the items excluded from the calculation.
Adjusted Earnings Per Share (Adjusted EPS) is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is useful to investors in evaluating our operating results and understanding our operating trends. Adjusted EPS is calculated by excluding the impact of divested operations and adding back the EPS impact of non-operational or non-recurring items to reported EPS.
The effective tax rate attributable to Verizon (Verizon's ETR) is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating results. Verizon's ETR is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by the income before the provision for income taxes attributable to Verizon, which excludes the portion attributable to the noncontrolling interest.

Verizon News Release, page 2
 
Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, NASDAQ: VZ) today reported strong first-quarter 2011 earnings, as industry leader Verizon Wireless continued to effectively balance customer growth and profitability, while growth in FiOS and strategic enterprise services contributed to another quarter of improvement in wireline margins.
NEW YORK --
Verizon reported 51 cents in EPS in first-quarter 2011, compared with first-quarter 2010 earnings of 16 cents per share. There are no adjustments to first-quarter 2011 earnings results. Adjusted first-quarter 2010 earnings, excluding the impact of divestitures and non-operational charges (non-GAAP), were 48 cents per share.
"In the first quarter, Verizon Wireless solidified its industry leadership with results that once again showed sustainable, profitable growth," said Verizon Chairman and CEO Ivan Seidenberg. "We are executing on our business plans and building momentum, and we are on track to meet both our revenue and earnings objectives for the year."
Seidenberg added, "Wireline EBITDA margins expanded for the fourth consecutive quarter, driven by continued strength in FiOS revenues and disciplined cost management. Our strategic acquisition of Terremark, which closed earlier this month, improves our ability to provide integrated, enterprise-class cloud solutions and accelerate growth."
On a consolidated basis, Verizon's total operating revenues were $27.0 billion in first-quarter 2011, an increase of 0.3 percent compared with first-quarter 2010. Last year's results included revenues from operations that have since been divested.
Verizon News Release, page 3
 
On a comparable basis (non-GAAP), first-quarter 2011 total operating revenues increased 5.3 percent compared with first-quarter 2010 -- up from growth of 2.3 percent on the same basis comparing fourth-quarter 2010 with fourth-quarter 2009. Approximately 77 percent of first-quarter 2011 revenues were generated by higher-growth wireless, FiOS and strategic enterprise services, compared with approximately 72 percent of comparable first-quarter 2010 revenues.
As previously stated, Verizon is targeting comparable top-line revenue growth rates in the range of 4 percent to 8 percent for full-year 2011. The company is also targeting EPS growth of 5 percent to 8 percent in 2011, over a comparable adjusted base of $2.08 per share in 2010.
Verizon continues to expect 2011 capital spending to be essentially flat, compared with the 2010 investment of $16.5 billion. In first-quarter 2011, Verizon's capital expenditures totaled $4.4 billion, compared with $3.4 billion in first-quarter 2010, as the company aggressively invested in growth opportunities, including the deployment of Verizon's nationwide 4G LTE (fourth-generation, Long-Term Evolution) wireless broadband network. With 4G LTE deployment well under way, Verizon's capitalized interest will be lower in 2011, resulting in higher interest expense of about $150 million for each quarter this year.
Cash flow from operations totaled $5.0 billion in first-quarter 2011, down from $7.1 billion in first-quarter 2010. Operating cash flow from higher net income in first-quarter 2011 was offset by the launch of the iPhone and satisfaction of Verizon's full-year 2011 pension funding obligation of $392 million. In addition, the first half of last year included cash flows from since-divested properties.
Verizon said its cash flow outlook for 2011 remains strong, and there is no change regarding the anticipated 2012 timing of a Verizon Wireless dividend to its parent companies.

The effective income tax rate attributable to Verizon for the first quarter was 30 percent. For full-year 2011, Verizon anticipates an effective tax rate to be in a range consistent with the past three quarters, post the Frontier and Alltel divestitures.
Verizon Wireless delivered strong growth in revenues, retail customers and other connections; increased retail postpaid ARPU (average monthly service revenue per user) and smartphone penetration; and delivered a strong EBITDA margin. In the first quarter of 2011:
