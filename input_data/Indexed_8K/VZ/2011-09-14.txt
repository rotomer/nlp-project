Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
In a September 14, 2011 presentation at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Media, Communications & Entertainment conference, Francis J. Shammo, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon), discussed the impact on Verizon's third quarter 2011 results of the repair and maintenance expenses and installation delays caused by the combination of the damage caused by Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee across the Verizon wireline footprint and the strike by Verizon's wireline workers in August.
 Verizon expects that its Wireline Segment EBITDA for the third quarter of 2011 will be $200 to 250 million below Verizon's prior expectations.
 Verizon expects that it will be able to return its Wireline installation backlog to normal levels in the next 90 to 100 days.
 Verizon Wireless' quarterly results are not expected to be impacted by these events.
