On a January 24, 2012 conference call with the investment community, Francis Shammo, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon) discussed Verizon's fourth quarter 2011 results and its outlook for 2012.
Verizon's outlook for 2012 earnings growth is unchanged from that provided on January 25, 2011, which was based on a 2011 adjusted earnings per share target range of $2.18 to $2.25, and is growth of 10% to 16% (or $2.40 to $2.61) in adjusted earnings per share.
