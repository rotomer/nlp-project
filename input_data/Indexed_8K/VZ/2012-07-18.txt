Item 8.01    Other Events.
During the first quarter of 2012, Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon) adopted the accounting standard update regarding the presentation of comprehensive income. This update was issued to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. The update requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders' equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate, but consecutive statements. The table filed as Exhibit 99 to this Current Report on Form 8-K supplementally discloses the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for Verizon for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 and should be read in conjunction with the information in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The standard update did not have any effect on Verizon's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
