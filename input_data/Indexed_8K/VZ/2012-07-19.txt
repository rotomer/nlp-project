Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Attached as Exhibit 99 hereto are a press release and financial tables dated July 19, 2012 issued by Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon).
Non-GAAP Measures
Verizon's press release and financial tables include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial information and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.
Verizon consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Consolidated EBITDA), Verizon Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA), Verizon Wireless Segment EBITDA (Wireless EBITDA), Verizon Wireless Segment EBITDA service margin (Wireless EBITDA service margin), Wireline Segment EBITDA (Wireline EBITDA) and Wireline Segment EBITDA margin (Wireline EBITDA margin) are non-GAAP measures and do not purport to be alternatives to GAAP items as measures of operating performance. Management believes that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to Verizon's competitors. Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, Wireless EBITDA, Wireless EBITDA service margin, Wireline EBITDA and Wireline EBITDA margin are presented along with the respective operating income and operating income margins so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on them than the corresponding GAAP measures.
Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses, equity in earnings of unconsolidated businesses and other income and (expense), net to net income. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding the effect of non-operational items from the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA.
Wireless EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expenses to Verizon Wireless operating income, and Wireless EBITDA service margin is calculated by dividing Wireless EBITDA by Verizon Wireless service revenues. Wireless EBITDA service margin utilizes service revenues rather than total revenues. Service revenues primarily exclude equipment revenues (as well as other non-service revenues) in order to capture the impact of providing service to the wireless customer base on an ongoing basis.
Wireline EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expenses to Wireline operating income, and Wireline EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Wireline EBITDA by total Wireline revenues.
Net Debt and the Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating Verizon's leverage. Net Debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt. For purposes of the Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the last 12 months. Management believes this presentation assists investors in understanding trends that are indicative of future operating results given the non-operational nature of the items excluded from the calculation.
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is useful to investors and other users of Verizon's financial information in evaluating cash available to pay debt and dividends. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities.

In second-quarter 2012 in the Wireline segment, revenue growth for FiOS led to overall revenue growth among U.S. consumer customers. Increased sales of strategic services helped mitigate lower revenues resulting from global economic impacts, including the adverse effects of foreign exchange rates compared with last year.
