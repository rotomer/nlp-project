On December 10, 2012, the Verizon Management Pension Plan (the Plan) purchased a single premium group annuity contract from The Prudential Insurance Company of America (Prudential) to settle approximately $7.5 billion of pension liabilities of the Plan. The purchase was made pursuant to the definitive purchase agreement, dated October 17, 2012 (the Agreement), entered into by Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon), Verizon Investment Management Corp., Fiduciary Counselors Inc., as independent fiduciary of the Plan, Prudential and Prudential Financial, Inc.
Verizon contributed an aggregate of approximately $2.6 billion to the Plan since September 1, 2012 in connection with the transaction.
As we have previously disclosed, in accordance with our accounting policy for pension and other postretirement benefits, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we will remeasure our pension and other postemployment benefit assets and liabilities based on updated actuarial assumptions including the actual return on plan assets during the year and the then current discount rate. As a result of this remeasurement and the purchase referenced above, we expect to record a significant charge in the fourth quarter of 2012.
