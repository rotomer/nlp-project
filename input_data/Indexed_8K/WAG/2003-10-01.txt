DEERFIELD, Ill., Sept. 29, 2003  Walgreen Co. (NYSE: WAG) today announced record sales and earnings for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2003, ending Aug. 31. This marks the 29 consecutive year of record results for the nation's largest drugstore chain. Walgreens also continued its industry-leading expansion during the year, opening 430 new stores, including 209 in the fourth quarter alone.
th
Net earnings for the fourth quarter were up 11.9 percent to $277.1 million or 27 cents per share (diluted) versus last year's $247.7 million or 24 cents per share. Fiscal year net earnings increased 15.4 percent to $1.176 billion or $1.14 per share (diluted) versus last year's $1.019 billion or 99 cents per share. Excluding gains of $29.6 million this year and $6.2 million last year from litigation settlements, fiscal year earnings rose 14.0 percent to $1.157 billion or $1.12 per share (diluted) from last year's $1.015 billion or 98 cents per share.
This year's LIFO inflation index came in under 1 percent, resulting in a fourth quarter LIFO credit of $19.5 million, versus a credit of $9.9 million last year. The lower index reflects more generic drug price decreases and some deflation among non-pharmacy inventories.
Chairman and CEO David Bernauer said, "The absence of price increases amplifies the challenge for retailers to grow earnings. Yet we continue to post double-digit increases. Most important is to look at what we take to the bank. Our percent of earnings to sales has increased over the last 10 years from 3.05 percent to 3.62 percent."
Sales rose 14.0 percent to $8.2 billion for the fourth quarter and 13.3 percent to $32.5 billion for the year. Total sales in comparable stores (those open more than a year) were up 9.9 percent for the quarter and 8.6 percent for the year. Prescriptions, which accounted for 62 percent of sales in fiscal 2003, climbed 17.1 percent in the fourth quarter and 17.4 percent for the year. Prescription sales in comparable stores rose 13.6 percent in the quarter and 13.2 percent for the year. Walgreens filled 400 million prescriptions in 2003, an increase of 10.7 percent from the previous year.
"We had a strong fourth quarter, as non-pharmacy sales bounced back," said Bernauer. "We also opened a record 127 new stores in August alone, and our store opening program is on track to reach 7,000 stores by 2010."
Walgreens also continues to gain market share across nearly all product categories. In the 52-week period ending Aug. 9, Walgreens gained market share against all food, drug and mass merchandise competitors in 55 of its top 60 product categories. "We've placed more emphasis on in-stock conditions and customer service, which we believe have fueled our increases in non-pharmacy sales and market share," said Walgreens President Jeff Rein. "And we've increased our 24-hour locations from 900 to 1,112 over the last year  nearly a 24 percent increase."
Among new services Walgreens plans is digital camera prints available at all stores nationwide by the end of December. Customers will be able to bring in their digital camera memory card or CD and receive 4-by-6 prints for just 29 cents each. "Getting prints from your digital camera will be as easy and inexpensive as developing a roll of film," said Rein, "and less expensive than printing at home."
Walgreens is budgeting more than $1 billion in capital investments for the new fiscal year, including expenditures for new stores and a new distribution center in Southern California, the fourth to open in the last two years. The company anticipates a fiscal 2004 net increase of approximately 365 stores after closing and relocations. The goal for total openings in the year is approximately 450.
Major areas for store expansion in 2004 include California, the Carolinas, Florida, Texas and the state of Washington. "Our growth created 10,000 new jobs in fiscal 2003, and we'll create a similar number of new jobs in fiscal 2004," said Rein.
Walgreens is growing its store base faster than its top three competitors combined. In 2003 Walgreens opened 344 net new stores (including store closings and relocations) versus a net gain of 117 stores for the next three largest chains combined. Freestanding locations now comprise 80 percent of Walgreens store base.
Driving the company's growth is the increasing demand for prescription drugs. Prescription drug sales in the U.S. increased 11.3 percent to $183 billion in 2002 and are expected to reach $446 billion by 2012. "Use of prescription drugs will continue to boom this decade, and our growth means we're ready for that increased business," said Bernauer.
Although selling, general and administration expenses increased 33 basis points in the fourth quarter to 21.63 percent of sales, that increase came as a result of new mandated accounting standards adopted in January 2003.
"With the turnaround in recent months of non-pharmacy sales and a strong back-to-school season, I'm very optimistic about the coming year," said Bernauer. "We have the right people, the right locations and the right products in place at the right time."
At Aug. 31, Walgreens operated 4,227 drugstores in 44 states and Puerto Rico, versus 3,883 a year ago.

[Preliminary and unaudited]
Sales and Earnings
Today we announced another record quarter and our 29 consecutive year of both record sales and profits. Fiscal 2003 was a challenging year, as we faced a down economy, lower consumer confidence and war in Iraq. But we still posted a solid double-digit earnings increase, and sales this summer have been very encouraging.
th
We opened 430 new stores in the year, including 127 stores in August alone. Our store count at the end of the fiscal year stood at 4,227, a net increase of 344 stores from 2002. Meanwhile, our top three competitors combined increased their store count by just 117.
Walgreens prescription sales increased 17.4 percent for the year. And our total number of prescriptions filled increased 10.7 percent to 400 million  more than any other retailer in the country.
Our financial position is stronger than at any time in our company history. We have $3 billion in owned real estate, over $1 billion in the bank and are in a strong cash flow position.
With such a solid financial position and encouraging sales reports, we're optimistic about the year ahead.
Looking over the income statement, you'll see our sales for the fourth quarter ended Aug. 31 were up 14.0 percent to a record $8.2 billion. Net earnings for the quarter climbed 11.9 percent to $277.1 million or 27 cents per share, diluted.
Fiscal 2003 sales were up 13.3 percent to $32.5 billion, while fiscal year net earnings rose 15.4 percent to $1.176 billion or $1.14 per share, diluted. Excluding a $29.6 million gain this year and a $6.2 million gain last year for litigation settlements, earnings rose 14.0 percent to $1.157 billion or $1.12 per share, diluted, from last year's $1.015 billion or 98 cents per share, diluted.
SG&A and Gross Profit Margins
Selling, general and administration expenses and gross profit margins were both affected by a new mandated accounting guideline that we adopted in January 2003. The guideline is from the Emerging Issues Task Force and is known as Issue No. 02-16. The guideline requires vendor allowances to be treated as a reduction of inventory cost unless specifically identified as reimbursement for other expenses. Any vendor allowances received in excess of those expenses also should be treated as a reduction of inventory cost.
Let's look at how the new EITF guideline affected gross profit margins and SG&A for both the quarter and the year. In the fourth quarter, our gross profit margin increased 23 basis points, and the new EITF guideline alone caused the margin to increase by 26 basis points.
SG&A in the fourth quarter increased 33 basis points, and the EITF by itself caused our SG&A to go up 34 basis points.
For the entire 2003 fiscal year, our gross profit margin increased 55 basis points. The EITF, which was in effect for 8 months of the fiscal year, caused a 17 basis point increase in gross profit margin.
SG&A increased 53 basis points for the year, and the EITF accounted for 23 of those basis points during the 8 months it was in effect.
The new guideline is just one of the factors that impacted our gross profit margin and SG&A. Gross margins for the fourth quarter and the year also were hurt by a greater percent of our total sales coming from the pharmacy, which has lower margins than the front end, and by fewer new generics hitting the market.
On the other hand, gross profit margins were helped by better buying and negotiating on product costs and supplies, and by faster growth of high-margin products in the front end.
Tax Rate
The effective annual tax rate of 37.75 percent for the year is unchanged from a year ago.
From the Balance Sheet and Statements of Cash Flows
The consolidated balance sheet and statements of cash flows can be found on our Investor Relations Web site under the tab, "Financials." For the year, cash increased from $450 million to $1.017 billion as of Aug. 31.
LIFO inventories were $4.202 billion, a 15.3 percent increase from the year ago quarter.
The fourth quarter's LIFO credit of $19.5 million was $9.6 million more than the year ago quarter. We experienced lower than expected inflation this year due to generic drug price decreases and some deflation among non-pharmacy inventories. The final LIFO rate for the year was 0.84 percent versus the 1.75 percent rate applied through the third quarter.
Finally on the statements of cash flows, capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 were $795.1 million compared to $934.4 million in 2002. The decrease is due mainly to fewer store real estate purchases this year.
Comparable Sales
Taking a closer look at our sales, total comparable store sales  for stores open more than a year - were up 9.9 percent in the quarter, while front-end comparable store sales rose 4.1 percent. For the year, comparable store sales increased 8.6 percent, while front-end comparable store sales rose 1.7 percent.
Pharmacy sales climbed 17.1 percent overall and 13.6 percent on a comparable store basis in the quarter. For the year, prescription sales increased 17.4 percent overall and 13.2 percent on a comparable store basis.
Wrapup
Despite the difficult retail environment, 2003 was another step forward for Walgreens. We're on track to reach our goal of 7,000 stores by 2010. We're opening more 24-hour stores to better serve our customers. We're gaining market share in nearly all of our top 60 product categories. And our financial condition is as strong as it's ever been.
Some industry watchers have expressed concern about a slowdown in prescriptions, but we see no evidence that this is a trend. In fact, we see nothing to suggest that prescription usage will be anything but robust in the decade to come. The slowdown seen in the industry since January is the result of a convergence of several unusual factors, including concerns about hormone-replacement therapy, major prescription-to-OTC switches such as Claritin and implementation of three-tier copays. Even with these factors, our total prescriptions filled in comparable stores increased 7.1 percent in the fourth quarter and 6.4 percent for the year.
The long-term outlook for prescription growth is as strong as ever. This is the best time in our history to expand, and we're positioning ourselves for the surge in prescription usage that's already under way.
Thank you for listening. Our next earnings announcement, for the first quarter of fiscal 2004, is scheduled for January 5. Once again, thanks for being a Walgreen shareholder, and remember, "You're Always Welcome at Walgreens!"
