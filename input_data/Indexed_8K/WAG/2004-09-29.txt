DEERFIELD, Ill., Sept. 27, 2004 - Walgreen Co. (NYSE, Nasdaq: WAG) today announced its 30 consecutive year of record sales and profits - one of only two companies among the 500 to achieve a current streak of that duration. The 103-year-old drugstore retailer announced record sales and earnings for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2004, ending Aug. 31. Walgreens also continued its aggressive expansion program, opening 436 new stores in fiscal 2004, including 208 in the fourth quarter alone.

Net earnings for the fourth quarter were up 18.1 percent to $327.2 million or 32 cents per share (diluted) versus last year's $277.1 million or 27 cents per share. Fiscal year net earnings increased 15.7 percent to $1.360 billion or $1.32 per share (diluted) versus last year's $1.176 billion or $1.14 per share. Excluding pre-tax gains of $16.3 million this year and $29.6 million last year from litigation settlements, fiscal year earnings rose 16.7 percent to $1.350 billion or $1.31 per share (diluted) from last year's $1.157 billion or $1.12 per share.
Sales rose 14.3 percent to $9.4 billion for the fourth quarter and 15.4 percent to $37.5 billion for the year. Total sales in comparable stores (those open more than a year) were up 9.7 percent for the quarter and 10.9 percent for the year. Prescriptions, which accounted for 63 percent of sales in fiscal 2004, climbed 16.4 percent in the fourth quarter and 17.8 percent for the year. Prescription sales in comparable stores rose 12.5 percent in the quarter and 14.0 percent for the year.
Walgreens strong pharmacy growth is best seen in the number of prescriptions filled in comparable stores. These increased 7.3 percent in fiscal 2004 compared to a 6.4 percent increase in fiscal 2003. Overall, Walgreens filled 443 million prescriptions in 2004, an increase of 10.8 percent from the previous year and more than any other pharmacy retailer.
Chairman and CEO David Bernauer said, "Though there was some softening industry-wide this year in prescription demand because of higher co-pays, we continued to record strong gains. In the long term prescription growth will be fueled by aging baby boomers and new drug development, and will become more important to controlling overall health care costs."
Advantage90, introduced by Walgreens pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) last November as a 90-day retail prescription option to mandatory mail programs, is gaining popularity. "Since January, we've doubled the number of insurance plans and employers offering Advantage90 and are now up to 75, including progressive and cost-conscious clients like Southwest Airlines," said Bernauer. "Not only do plans prefer offering their members a choice between mail and retail pharmacies, but we've found our average price of a 90-day prescription filled at retail is $20 less than our average price of a mail order prescription. Numbers like that get the attention of benefit managers."
Gross profit margins for the quarter increased 74 basis points to 27.73 as a percent to sales. That includes a LIFO credit of $48.5 million (versus a credit of $19.5 million a year ago), reflecting less than anticipated inflation in prescription drugs.
Gross margins increased for both general merchandise and prescription drugs, which saw more generic utilization. "The growth in generic prescriptions is an excellent development for patients and payers, and it helps our gross profit," said Walgreens President Jeff Rein. "But less expensive generics slowed our sales line in the quarter and contributed to an increase in selling, occupancy and administration expenses when measured as a percent to sales."
Digital photofinishing contributed significantly to the gross margin increase for general merchandise. "We've accelerated our replacement of analog photo labs with digital machines," said Rein. "The costs associated with the fast conversion are far outweighed by both our gross profit results and improved customer satisfaction."
The digital conversion as well as a higher investment in payroll to improve customer service contributed to a 63-basis point increase in SO&A expenses in the fourth quarter. SO&A for the fourth quarter was 22.26 as a percent to sales.
In the 52-week period ending Aug. 7, Walgreens gained market share against all food, drug and mass merchandise competitors in 59 of its top 60 product categories as measured by A.C. Nielsen. This represents more than 60 percent of Walgreens self-service sales. The gains outpaced aggressive store expansion, reflecting growth in existing stores.
"Even the hurricanes that hit Florida and the Southeast didn't slow our sales," said Rein. "In fact, our top seven markets in non-pharmacy sales during August all were in Hurricane Charley's path."
Walgreens is budgeting approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments for fiscal 2005. This reflects expenditures for new stores (including more planned real estate purchases), technology and a new distribution center in South Carolina scheduled to open in 2007. The company anticipates a fiscal 2005 net increase of about 365 stores after closings and relocations. The goal for total openings in the year is about 450.
"Our growth created 9,000 new jobs in fiscal 2004, and we'll create a similar number of new jobs in fiscal 2005," said Rein.
At Aug. 31, Walgreens operated 4,582 drugstores in 44 states and Puerto Rico, versus 4,227 a year ago.

For fiscal 2004, the LIFO provision was a charge of $6.7 million versus a charge of $36.2 million a year ago. Fiscal 2004 includes a $16.3 million pre-tax ($10.2 million after-tax) gain for litigation settlements versus a $29.6 million pre-tax ($18.4 million after tax) gain in fiscal 2003. Excluding these gains, pre-tax earnings for fiscal 2004 increased 16.2 percent to $2.160 billion from last year's $1.859 billion, and after-tax earnings for the year increased 16.7 percent to $1.350 billion from last year's $1.157 billion.

Hello, and welcome to Walgreens audio webcast for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ending Aug. 31, 2004. I'm Rick Hans, Walgreens Director of Finance, and I'd like to thank you for tuning in.

Sales and Earnings
Today we announced our 30 consecutive year of record sales and profits. How unusual is that? Consider this - only two companies listed on the 500 have a current streak of at least 30 straight years of record earnings - Walgreens is one, and the other company also starts with W-A-L. We're proud of the consistent performance we've achieved over those three decades.

Fortune
Fiscal 2004 was another strong year for your company:
We increased net earnings per share 15.8 percent, outpacing our 15.4 percent increase in sales.
We increased our quarterly dividend 21.7 percent.
We opened 436 new stores across the country, for a net gain after closings and relocations of 355.
We opened a new distribution center in Southern California - our fourth new DC in just over two years.
We continued to increase our market share versus food, drug and mass retailers in virtually all of our top 60 product categories as measured by A.C. Nielsen. That growth is coming from both new existing stores.
and
Our Walgreens Health Initiatives pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) introduced Advantage90, which offers a 90-day retail prescription option to mandatory mail programs.
We saw greater use of generic prescription drugs, which help lower overall drug costs while increasing gross profit margins.
We successfully introduced our own Medicare-approved drug discount card, which saved 120,000 seniors on average more than 27 percent per prescription in the program's first three months.
And, we're capturing the digital photo customer with prints from digital cameras available in all of our stores.
We believe there's more innovation going on at our company today than at any point in our 103-year history. That's what will drive results in the future.
But right now, let's take a closer look at the just-ended fourth quarter. Looking over the income statement, you'll see our sales for the fourth quarter ended Aug. 31 were up 14.3 percent to a record $9.4 billion. Net earnings for the quarter climbed 18.1 percent to $327.2 million or 32 cents per share, diluted.
Fiscal 2004 sales were up 15.4 percent to $37.5 billion, while fiscal year net earnings rose 15.7 percent to $1.360 billion or $1.32 per share, diluted. Excluding a $16.3 million pre-tax gain this year and a $29.6 million pre-tax gain last year for litigation settlements, earnings rose 16.7 percent to $1.350 billion or $1.31 per share, diluted, from last year's $1.157 billion or $1.12 per share, diluted.
Walgreens prescription sales increased 16.4 percent in the fourth quarter and 17.8 percent for the year. Prescription sales in comparable stores - that's stores open more than a year - rose 12.5 percent in the quarter and 14.0 percent for the year. Our total number of prescriptions filled in fiscal 2004 increased 10.8 percent to 443 million - more than any other pharmacy retailer in the country.
Total comparable store sales were up 9.7 percent for the quarter and 10.9 percent for the year. Front-end comparable store sales rose 5.1 percent for the quarter and 6.1 percent for the year, primarily driven by increasing customer counts.
Gross Profit Marginsand SO&A
We showed a very strong increase in gross profit margins this quarter, as they increased 74 basis points to 27.73 as a percent to sales. We saw margin increases in both general merchandise and pharmacy, which experienced more generic drug utilization. Again, I want to emphasize that generic drugs mean lower costs for patients and third-party payers, while also providing us with better gross profit dollars per prescription.
But when you're dispensing less expensive generics, it also slows your sales growth. And that, in turn, hurts your selling, occupancy and administration expense ratios.
That was a significant factor in SO&A expenses increasing 63 basis points in the fourth quarter to 22.26 as a percent to sales. Other factors were costs associated with our ongoing and accelerated replacement of analog photo labs with digital machines and payroll investments. The move toward digital photo machines is a great business decision because of the excellent return on investment we're seeing.
Tax Rate
The effective annual tax rate of 37.5 percent for the year is a quarter-point below the previous year.
From the Balance Sheet and Statements of Cash Flows
The consolidated balance sheet and statements of cash flows can be found on our Investor Relations Web site under the tab, "Financials." For the year, cash increased from $1.27 billion to $1.70 billion as of Aug. 31.
Accounts receivable grew 14.9 percent this quarter, which is less than the growth rate of third party prescription sales.
On a fourth quarter sales gain of 14.3 percent, LIFO inventories increased just 12.8 percent versus a year ago. We've worked through the higher inventories we had last year, and a new integrated forecasting system for front-end merchandise is improving days of supply in those categories.
The fourth quarter's LIFO credit of $48.5 million was $29.0 million more than the year ago quarter. We experienced lower than expected inflation this year in prescription drugs. The final LIFO rate for the year was 0.14 percent versus the 1.5 percent rate applied through the third quarter.
Accounts payable increased 9.7 percent over the prior year.
Finally on the statements of cash flows, capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 were $939.5 million compared to $795.1 million in 2003. The increase is due mainly to more store equipment purchases this year. The estimate for capital expenditures next year is $1.5 billion, reflecting an expected increase in store purchases, technology and a new distribution center in South Carolina scheduled to open in 2007.
Wrapup
Now that we've wrapped up three straight decades of earnings increases, we're not about to rest. We're on track to reach our goal of 7,000 stores by 2010. We're beginning work on a new prototype distribution center that will open in South Carolina in 2007. We're making investments in technology that will improve operations throughout our stores. We're gaining market share in 59 of our top 60 product categories. And we intend to keep our strong financial condition going.
While the rest of the industry is experiencing what we believe is a temporary slowdown in prescription growth, we're pushing ahead. The number of prescriptions we filled in comparable stores increased faster this year than the year before by nearly a full percentage point. We're as excited as ever about the long-term potential for prescription growth and the overall cost savings that medications can provide. We're in a great position to benefit from those trends.
Thank you for listening. Our next earnings announcement, for the first quarter of fiscal 2005, is scheduled for January 3. Once again, thanks for being a Walgreen shareholder, and remember, "You're Always Welcome at Walgreens!"
