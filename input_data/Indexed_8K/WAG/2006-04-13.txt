DEERFIELD, Ill. - Walgreen Co. today announced that President Jeffrey A. Rein will become chief executive officer, effective July 12, 2006, coinciding with the companys next board of directors meeting. He will retain his title as president. Current CEO and Chairman David W. Bernauer, who will turn 62 later this month, will continue as chairman. The moves are part of Walgreens long-range leadership succession planning.
Bernauer will remain actively engaged in day-to-day business operations, maintaining oversight of corporate strategy, information technology, law and government affairs.
Rein, 54, a pharmacist, earned his accounting degree in 1974 and his pharmacy degree in 1980 from the University of Arizona in Tucson. He joined Walgreens as an assistant manager in 1982 and was promoted to store manager in 1984, district manager in 1990, divisional vice president and treasurer in 1996 and vice president of marketing systems and services in 2000. He was named executive vice president of marketing in 2001 and promoted to president and chief operating officer in 2003.
Reins career has followed the traditional path of other top Walgreen managers. "Most importantly, Jeff started in the stores," said Bernauer. "Hes had proven success building our people and our business in the Southwest, and hes done the same at the national level through 10 very productive years in several key corporate positions. There isnt a segment of our
business in which Jeff hasnt been intimately involved, and hes a key player in our strategy and operations. Hes providing strong, energizing leadership as president and will continue to do so as CEO."
