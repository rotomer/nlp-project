Item 5.03.  AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION OR BYLAWS; CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR
 
 
On October 9, 2007, the Board of Directors of Walgreen Co. (the "company") approved and adopted an amendment to the company's By-Laws.  The amendment revises the policy of the company regarding the age of director nominees.  The policy now provides that, notwithstanding the fact that a person has reached his or her seventy-second birthday, 
such person may be nominated by the Nominating and Governance Committee of the company to serve as director if the committee makes a finding that the nomination is in the best interests of the company, and if the nomination is also approved by all members of the Board of Directors.  The amendment took effect upon adoption.  A copy of the company's By-Laws, as so amended, is attached hereto as Exhibit 3(b) and incorporated herein by reference.  A corresponding change to the company's Corporate Governance Guidelines was also approved and will be available on the company's website at www.walgreens.com.

Such list shall also be produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting and shall be subject to the inspection of any shareholder during the whole time of the meeting.  The original share ledger or transfer book, or any duplicate thereof kept in this State, shall be prima facie evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to examine such list or share ledger or transfer book or to vote at any meeting of shareholders.
Voting Lists.
SECTION 7.  .  A majority of outstanding shares entitled to vote on a matter, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of shareholders; provided that if less than a majority of the outstanding shares are represented at said meeting, a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice.  In no event shall a quorum consist of less than one-third of the outstanding shares entitled to vote.
Quorum
If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on a matter shall be the act of the shareholders, unless the vote of a greater number or voting by classes is required by The Business Corporation Act or the Articles of Incorporation of the corporation.

Such proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of the corporation before or at the time of the meeting.  No proxy shall be valid after eleven months from the date of its executing, unless otherwise provided in the proxy.  Every proxy continues in full force and effect until revoked by the person executing it prior to the vote thereon, except to the extent such proxy is irrevocable.  Such revocation may be affected by a writing delivered to the corporation stating that the proxy is revoked, or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or by attendance at the meeting and voting in person by, the person executing the proxy.  The dates contained on the forms of the proxy presumptively determine the order of execution, regardless of the postmark dates on the envelopes in which they are mailed.  Notwithstanding any provision contained in these By-laws, a shareholder may electronically transmit or authorize the electronic transmission of his or her proxy, if done as prescribed by law.
Proxies

The corporation may treat the president or other person holding the position of chief executive officer of such other corporation as authorized to vote such shares, together with any other person indicated and any other holder of an office indicated by the corporate shareholder to the corporation as a person or an office authorized to vote such shares as the by-laws of such corporation may prescribe, or, in the absence of such provision, as the board of directors of such corporation may determine.
Shares registered in the name of a deceased person, a minor ward or person under legal disability, may be voted by his or her administrator, executor, or court appointed guardian, either in person or by proxy without a transfer of such shares into the name of such administrator, executor, or court appointed guardian.  Shares registered in the name of a trustee may be voted by him or her, either in person or by proxy.
Shares registered in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver, and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by such receiver without the transfer thereof into his or her name if authority so to do is contained in an appropriate order of the court by which such receiver was appointed.  A shareholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, and thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred.
SECTION 11.    In all elections for directors, every shareholder shall have the right to vote, in person or by proxy, the number of shares owned by such shareholder, for as many persons as there are directors to be elected, or to cumulate such votes and give one candidate as many votes as shall equal the number of directors multiplied by the number of such shares, or to distribute such cumulative votes in any proportion among any number of candidates.
Cumulative Voting.
SECTION 12.    Voting on any question or in any election may be viva voce unless the presiding officer shall order that voting be by ballot.

If inspectors of election are not so appointed, the person acting as chairman at any such meeting may, and on the request of any shareholder shall, make such appointment.
Inspectors of Election
The inspectors shall ascertain and report the number of shares represented at the meeting, based upon their determination of the validity and effect of proxies; count all votes and report the results; and do such other acts as are proper to conduct the election and voting with impartiality and fairness to all the shareholders.
Each report of an inspector shall be in writing and signed by him or her or by a majority of them if there is more than one inspector acting at such meeting.  If there is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be the report of the inspectors.  The report of the inspector or inspectors on the number of shares represented at the meeting and the results of the voting shall be prima facie evidence thereof.
SECTION 15.  .  Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 15 shall be eligible for election at a meeting of shareholders as directors of the corporation.  Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the corporation may be made at a meeting of shareholders (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) by any shareholder of the corporation who is a shareholder of record at the time of giving notice provided for in this Section, who shall be entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting and who complies with the procedures set forth in this Section 15.

At the request of the Board of Directors, any person nominated by the Board of Directors for election as a director shall furnish to the Secretary of the corporation that information required to be set forth in a shareholders notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee.  No person shall be eligible to serve as a Director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this by-law.  The Chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the By-laws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
