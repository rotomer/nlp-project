Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
     (e) On November 10, 2010, Walgreen Co. (the "Company"), adopted the Walgreen Co. 2011 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Plan is effective January 1, 2011 and provides an opportunity for eligible employees to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Pursuant to the Plan, the Company provides eligible employees, including members of senior management, the opportunity to enter into agreements for the deferral of a specified percentage (up to 10%) of their 2011 annual base salary. The amount of compensation to be deferred by each participating eligible employee (individually, a "participant" and collectively, the "participants") is determined in accordance with the Plan based on elections by each participant. Each payment obligation for distribution of the deferred compensation is payable in cash on a date or dates selected by each participant at the time of enrollment, subject to change in certain specified circumstances.
     Amounts deferred under the Plan will be credited to bookkeeping accounts maintained by the Company for each participant and will be credited or debited with the participant's proportionate share of any gains or losses attributable to the performance of investment options selected by the participant, which consist of certain funds that are also offered under the Walgreen Co. Profit-Sharing Plan. Accounts of participants under the Plan are not funded and payment obligations pursuant to the Plan are unsecured general obligations of the Company.
     The Company reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time, provided that no such action shall alter a participant's right to receive a payment due under the terms of the Plan at the date of the action.
     This summary of the terms of the Plan is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.

Exhibit 99.1
     DEERFIELD, Ill., Nov. 10, 2010  Walgreen Co. (NYSE: WAG)(NASDAQ: WAG) has been notified of an unsolicited "mini-tender" offer by TRC Capital Corporation to purchase up to 3 million shares, or approximately 0.3 percent, of the outstanding Walgreens common stock at a price of $33 per share. TRC's offer price represents approximately a 4.3 percent discount to the $34.49 closing price of Walgreens common stock on Nov. 2, 2010, the day before the offer commenced, and a 6.2 percent discount to the $35.06 closing price of Walgreens common stock on Nov. 9, 2010, the last trading day prior to the date of this news release. In addition, TRC's offer is subject to numerous conditions, including the availability of financing on terms satisfactory to TRC in its reasonable discretion.
     Walgreens does not endorse TRC's offer and recommends that shareholders do not tender their shares in response to the offer because it is a mini-tender offer at a price below the current market price for Walgreens shares and is subject to numerous conditions. Walgreens urges shareholders to obtain current market quotations for their shares, review the conditions to the offer, consult with their broker or financial adviser and exercise caution with respect to TRC's offer. Walgreens is not associated in any way with TRC, its mini-tender offer or the offer documentation.
     According to TRC's current offer documents, Walgreens shareholders who have already tendered their shares may withdraw their shares at any time prior to 12:01 a.m., New York City time, on Friday, Dec. 3, 2010, the expiration date set forth in the offer documents (unless extended), by following the procedures described in the offer documents.
     TRC has made many similar mini-tender offers for shares of other companies. Mini-tender offers are designed to seek to acquire less than 5 percent of a company's outstanding shares, thereby avoiding many disclosure and procedural requirements of the Securities and
 
Exchange Commission (SEC) that apply to offers for more than 5 percent of a company's outstanding shares. As a result, mini-tender offers do not provide investors with the same level of protections as provided by larger tender offers under United States securities laws.
     The SEC has cautioned investors about mini-tender offers, noting that "some bidders make these offers at below-market prices, hoping that they will catch investors off guard if the investors do not compare the offer price to the current market price." The SEC's Investor Tips regarding mini-tender offers may be found on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/minitend.htm.
     Walgreens encourages broker and dealers, as well as other market participants, to review the SEC's letter regarding broker-dealer mini-tender offer dissemination and disclosures at www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/minitenders/sia072401.htm and Information Memo Number 01-27 issued by the NYSE on Sept. 28, 2001, regarding the dissemination of mini-tender offer materials, which can be found on the NYSE's Website at www.nyse.com.
     Walgreens requests that a copy of this press release be included with all distributions of materials relating to TRC's offer.
