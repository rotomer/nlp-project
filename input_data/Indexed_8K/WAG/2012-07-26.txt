As previously disclosed, on June 18, 2012 Walgreen Co. (the "Company" or "Walgreens") entered into (i) a Purchase and Option Agreement by and among the Company, Alliance Boots GmbH ("Alliance Boots"), a private limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Switzerland and AB Acquisitions Holdings Limited, a private limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Gibraltar jointly controlled by affiliates of Stefano Pessina and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (the "Purchase and Option Agreement") and (ii) a commitment letter for a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $3,500,000,000 (the "Commitment Letter") to be available to fund, in part, the purchase of 45% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Alliance Boots in the first step transaction contemplated by the Purchase and Option Agreement (the "Initial Share Purchase") and to pay related fees and expenses. Please refer to the Company's Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 19, 2012 for additional information regarding the Purchase and Option Agreement and the Commitment Letter.
The Bridge Loan Agreement described below is the definitive documentation relating to the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter. In addition, the Company concurrently entered into the unsecured revolving credit facility described below and an amendment to its existing 2011 unsecured revolving credit facility described below, in each case, in connection with its commercial paper program.
On July 23, 2012, Walgreens entered into an unsecured 364-Day Bridge Term Loan Agreement dated as of July 23, 2012 (the "Bridge Loan Agreement") with the lenders party thereto, Goldman Sachs Bank USA ("GS"), as administrative agent, GS and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPFS"), as joint lead arrangers (collectively, the "Arrangers") and joint bookrunners, and Bank of America, N.A. ("BofA"), as syndication agent.
Bridge Loan Agreement.
The Bridge Loan Agreement provides Walgreens with the ability to borrow up to $3,500,000,000 to fund, in part, the Initial Share Purchase and to pay related fees and expenses. The availability of the loans under the Bridge Loan Agreement, which have not yet been funded, is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of certain conditions set forth therein. The date on which such conditions are satisfied (or waived in accordance with the Bridge Loan Agreement) in connection with the consummation of the Initial Share Purchase is the "Closing Date". The loans under the Bridge Loan Agreement are to be made in a single borrowing on the Closing Date and will mature and be payable in full on the date that is 364 days after the Closing Date (and if such date is not a business day, then the immediately preceding business day).
Borrowings by the Company under the Bridge Loan Agreement will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at the Company's option, the alternate base rate or the reserve adjusted Eurodollar rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on the Company's credit ratings. In no event will the alternate base rate be less than the sum of (i) the one-month British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate plus (ii) 1.0%. The applicable margin will increase by 0.375% on the 90th day, 180th and 270th day after the Closing Date. The Company will also pay to the lenders under this facility certain customary fees, including duration fees and commitment fees.
Voluntary prepayments of the loans and voluntary reductions of the unutilized portion of the commitments under the Bridge Loan Agreement are permissible without penalty, subject to certain conditions pertaining to minimum notice and minimum reduction amounts as described in the Bridge Loan Agreement. The Bridge Loan Agreement requires the Company to apply net cash proceeds of the incurrence of certain indebtedness, certain issuances of equity securities, and certain asset sales received by it to prepay the loans (if such net cash proceeds are received after the Closing Date) or to reduce the commitment under the Bridge Loan Agreement (if such net cash proceeds are received prior to the Closing Date), in each case, subject to certain thresholds and exceptions, as described in the Bridge Loan Agreement.
The Bridge Loan Agreement contains representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, as well as a financial covenant requiring that, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, commencing with the first quarter-end after the Closing Date, the ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization shall (as those terms are defined in the Bridge Loan Agreement) not be greater than 0.50:1.00. The negative covenants in the Bridge Loan Agreement include, among other things, the following limitations (subject to certain exceptions and thresholds as described therein):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, the Bridge Loan Agreement contains an affirmative covenant requiring the Company to use all commercially reasonable efforts following the Closing Date to refinance the loans under the Bridge Loan Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable.
The Bridge Loan Agreement also contains various events of default (subject to grace periods, as applicable) including among others: nonpayment of principal, interest, or fees when due; breach of covenant; payment default on, or other default under, certain other material indebtedness; inaccuracy of the representations or warranties in any material respect; bankruptcy or insolvency; certain unfunded liabilities under employee benefit plans; certain unsatisfied judgments; certain ERISA violations; a change of control (as defined in the Bridge Loan Agreement); and the invalidity or unenforceability of the Bridge Loan Agreement or any note issued in accordance therewith.
On July 23, 2012, concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Bridge Loan Agreement, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Revolving Credit Agreement") with the lenders party thereto, BofA, as administrative agent and a letter of credit issuer, MLPFS and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as syndication agent and a letter of credit issuer. The Revolving Credit Agreement, which replaces the Company's $600 million five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility that was due to expire on August 13, 2012, is a five-year $850 million senior unsecured revolving facility, $200 million of which is also available for the issuance of letters of credit. The issuance of letters of credit reduces the aggregate amount otherwise available under the Revolving Credit Agreement for the making of revolving loans. Under specified circumstances, the commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement can be increased to up to $1.15 billion in the aggregate.
Revolving Credit Agreement.
The ability of Company to request the making of revolving loans or issuance of letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Agreement is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of certain conditions set forth therein. Subject to the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Company may borrow, repay and reborrow revolving loans at any time prior to the earlier of (a) July 23, 2017 and (b) the date of termination in whole of the lenders' commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof.
Borrowings by the Company under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at the Company's option, the alternate base rate or the reserve adjusted Eurodollar rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on the Company's credit ratings. In no event will the alternate base rate be less than the sum of (i) the one-month British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate plus (ii) 1.0%. The Company will also pay to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement certain customary fees, including a facility fee on the daily amount of each lender's commitment (regardless of usage), calculated based on the Company's credit ratings.
Voluntary prepayments of the loans and voluntary reductions of the unutilized portion of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement are permissible without penalty, subject to certain conditions pertaining to minimum notice and minimum reduction amounts as described in the Revolving Credit Agreement.
The Revolving Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, affirmative, negative, and financial covenants, and events of default substantially similar to those contained in the Bridge Loan Agreement.
On July 23, 2012, concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Bridge Loan Agreement and the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to Credit Agreement (the "Amendment Agreement") to its existing $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility due to expire on July 20, 2015 (as amended by the Amendment Agreement, the "Existing Credit Agreement"), by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto, BofA, as administrative agent and a letter of credit issuer, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as a letter of credit issuer. The Amendment Agreement modifies the Existing Credit Agreement to more closely align certain of its terms and conditions with those in the Revolving Credit Agreement and Bridge Loan Agreement described above.
Amendment to Existing Credit Agreement.
The Existing Credit Agreement allows for the issuance of up to $250 million in letters of credit. The issuance of letters of credit reduces the aggregate amount otherwise available under the Existing Credit Agreement for the making of revolving loans. Under specified circumstances, the commitments under the Existing Credit Agreement can be increased to up to $700 million in the aggregate.
The ability of the Company to request the making of revolving loans or issuance of letters of credit under the Existing Credit Agreement is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of certain conditions set forth therein. Subject to the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement, the Company may borrow, repay and reborrow revolving loans at any time prior to the earlier of (a) July 20, 2015 and (b) the date of termination in whole of the lenders' commitments under the Existing Credit Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof.
Borrowings by the Company under the Existing Credit Agreement will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at the Company's option, the alternate base rate or the reserve adjusted Eurodollar rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on the Company's credit ratings. In no event will the alternate base rate be less than the sum of (i) the one-month British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate plus (ii) 1.0%. The Company will also pay to the lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement customary fees, including a facility fee on the daily amount of each lender's commitment (regardless of usage), calculated based on the Company's credit ratings.
Voluntary prepayments of the loans and voluntary reductions of the unutilized portion of the commitments under the Existing Credit Agreement are permissible without penalty, subject to certain conditions pertaining to minimum notice and minimum reduction amounts as described in the Existing Credit Agreement.
The Existing Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, affirmative, negative, and financial covenants, and events of default substantially similar to those contained in the Revolving Credit Agreement.

Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance shall be payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the Eurodollar Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity. Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance having an Interest Period longer than three (3) months shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month interval during such Interest Period. Interest accrued pursuant to Section 2.11 shall be payable on demand. With respect to (a) interest on all Advances (other than Floating Rate Loans where the interest is based on the Alternate Base Rate), Facility Fees, Letter of Credit Fees and other fees hereunder, such interest or fees shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year and (b) interest on Advances which are Floating Rate Loans where the interest is based on the Alternate Base Rate, such interest shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 365/366-day year. Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior to 1:00 p.m. (New York time) at the place of payment. If any payment of principal of or interest on an Advance, any fees or any other amounts payable to any Agent or any Lender hereunder shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing interest, fees and commissions in connection with such payment.

Promptly after receipt thereof, the Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice, Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice, notice of a reduction of the Letter of Credit Sublimit and repayment notice received by it hereunder. The Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Eurodollar Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate. Not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York time) on each Borrowing Date, each Lender shall make available its Revolving Loan or Revolving Loans in funds immediately available in New York to the Administrative Agent at its address specified pursuant to Article 13. The Administrative Agent will make the funds so received from the Lenders available to the Borrower at the Administrative Agent's aforesaid address; , , that if, on the date of an Advance, there are L/C Borrowings outstanding, then the proceeds of such Advance, first, shall be applied to payment in full of any such L/C Borrowings and second, shall be made available to the Borrower as provided above.

(a) (i) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Advance of Eurodollar Loans (or, in the case of any Advance of Floating Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon (New York time) on the date of such Advance) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Advance, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.16 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Advance available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Floating Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Advance to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Revolving Loan included in such Advance. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally

A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (a) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
(b) . The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Revolving Loans, fund participations in Letters of Credit and to make payments pursuant to Section 9.06(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Revolving Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 9.06(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Revolving Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 9.06(c).
Obligations of Lenders Several

(c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.01 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.05, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and
(d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable laws.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Revolving Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations held by it (excluding any amount received by the L/C Issuer to secure the obligations of a Defaulting Lender to fund risk participations hereunder) resulting in such Lender's receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Revolving Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its Pro Rata Share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and other amounts owing them, that:

The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

Upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer (i) if the L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, or (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, the Borrower shall, in each case, immediately Cash Collateralize the then outstanding amount of all L/C Obligations. At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, immediately upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to cover all Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.22(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).

The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Lender, such Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to Section 2.21(c). If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the applicable Fronting Exposure and other obligations secured thereby, the Borrower or the relevant Defaulting Lender will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency.

Application
 
(d) . Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 12.01(b)(viii))) or (ii) the Administrative Agent's good faith determination that there exists excess Cash Collateral; , , (x) that Cash Collateral furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower shall not be released during the continuance of a Default or Unmatured Default (and following application as provided in this Section 2.21 may be otherwise applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) and (y) the Person providing Cash Collateral and the L/C Issuer, may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations.

(iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by an Advance of Floating Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the default rate of interest pursuant to Section 2.11. In such event, each Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03.
(iv) Until a Lender funds its Revolving Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C Issuer.

(vi) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii), the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. A certificate of
the L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(i) At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender's L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of cash collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender's L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.
Repayment of Participations
(ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect.

In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Advance available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Floating Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Advance to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Revolving Loan included in such Advance.

(ii) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as applicable, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent.
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (a) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
(b) . The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Revolving Loans, fund participations in Letters of Credit and to make payments pursuant to Section 9.06(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Revolving Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 9.06(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Revolving Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 9.06(c).
Obligations of Lenders Several
. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.01 or 3.02 or if any Lender ceases to have an obligation to make Eurodollar Loans pursuant to Section 3.03, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.05, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or if a Lender fails to consent to an amendment or waiver approved by the Required Lenders as to any matter for which such Lender's consent is needed, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents

required by, Section 12.01), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), that:
provided
(a) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 12.01(b)(iv);
(b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Revolving Loans and L/C Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.04) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
(c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.01 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.05, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and
(d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable laws.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Revolving Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations held by it (excluding any amount received by the L/C Issuer to secure the obligations of a Defaulting Lender to fund risk participations hereunder) resulting in such Lender's receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Revolving Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its Pro Rata Share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and other amounts owing them, that:
Section 2.20
Sharing of Payments by Lenders.
provided
(i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
 
(ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in Section 2.21 or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Revolving Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).
The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
(a) . Upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer (i) if the L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, or (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, the Borrower shall, in each case, immediately Cash Collateralize the then outstanding amount of all L/C Obligations. At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, immediately upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to cover all Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.22(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).
Section 2.21
. Cash Collateral.
Certain Credit Support Events
(b) . All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts (other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent (that such Cash Collateral shall be invested solely in investments that provide for preservation of capital)) at Bank of America. The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Lender, such Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to Section 2.21(c). If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject

to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the applicable Fronting Exposure and other obligations secured thereby, the Borrower or the relevant Defaulting Lender will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency.
(c) . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this Section 2.21 or Sections 2.03, 2.22 or 8.01 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations, obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest and the Facility Fees accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may be provided for herein.
Application
(d) . Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 12.01(b)(viii))) or (ii) the Administrative Agent's good faith determination that there exists excess Cash Collateral; , , (x) that Cash Collateral furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower shall not be released during the continuance of a Default or Unmatured Default (and following application as provided in this Section 2.21 may be otherwise applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) and (y) the Person providing Cash Collateral and the L/C Issuer, may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations.

Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.22(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.

(b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Revolving Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Revolving Loan other than a Floating Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or
(c) any assignment of a Eurodollar Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19;
including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Revolving Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.

(i) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall to the extent permitted by applicable laws be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes.

Each Lender and the L/C Issuer hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or the L/C Issuer under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (ii). The agreements in this clause (ii) shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.
