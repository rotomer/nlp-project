Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release Contact: Gene Cassis, Vice President of Investor Relations, 508-482-2349 Waters Corporation First Quarter 2003 Sales Up 2% Before Currency Effects, Earnings Per Diluted Share In Line with Company's Expectations Milford, Massachusetts, April 22, 2003 -- Waters Corporation (NYSE/WAT) reported today first quarter 2003 sales of $221 million, an increase of 10% over the $200 million in sales reported for the first quarter of 2002. This growth is comprised of 2% organic growth (prior to currency effects) and an 8% benefit from foreign exchange in the quarter. Earnings per diluted share (E.P.S.) for the first quarter were $0.26 compared to $0.26 for the comparable period in 2002. On a pro-forma basis, excluding unusual charges, E.P.S. were $0.30 for the quarter, an increase of 11% over the pro-forma E.P.S. of $0.27 reported for the first quarter of 2002. Free cash flow for the first quarter was approximately $30 million. Commenting on the quarter Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "Overall our results reflect cautious spending by our pharmaceutical and life science customers and relatively stronger demand from our industrial customers. Sales growth by product line for the quarter was in line with our expectations. Additionally, we are pleased to report on the accelerated completion of our $200 million stock buy-back program and the successful integration of the recently acquired rheometry instrument product line within our TA Instruments division. Lastly, at this year's ASMS conference in June, we plan to introduce a new triple quadrupole mass spectrometry system designed to meet the performance requirements of researchers in drug development. Our production plan anticipates shipments in late 2003." The Company reported certain unusual charges in the first quarter, as explained in the accompanying financial schedules. These consisted of restructuring charges associated with the combination of the Company's field organizations, the divestiture of the Company's inorganic mass spectrometry business, the acquisition of the rheometry product line from Rheometrics Scientific Inc. and charges related to on-going legal matters. In addition to the results presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the Company believes it is appropriate to provide "pro-forma" information that adjusts results to exclude unusual items such as non-operational, non-cash charges and benefits, and one-time charges. Management uses such pro-forma information internally to evaluate the Company's performance and to manage its operations. The accompanying financial schedules contain a detailed presentation of both GAAP and pro-forma results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003.
