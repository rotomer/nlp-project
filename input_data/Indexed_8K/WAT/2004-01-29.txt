For Immediate Release
Contact: Gene Cassis, Vice President of Investor Relations, 508-482-2349
Milford, Massachusetts, January 29, 2004  Waters Corporation (NYSE/WAT) reported today fourth quarter 2003 sales of $275.1 million, an increase of 7% over reported sales of $256.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Foreign currency translation benefited revenue growth by approximately 7%. Reported GAAP quarterly earnings per diluted share (E.P.S.) were $0.47, compared to $0.30 for the fourth quarter in 2002. On a pro-forma basis, E.P.S. were $0.48 compared to fourth quarter 2002 E.P.S. of $0.41. Free cash flow for the quarter was approximately $81 million.
Commenting on the quarter, Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer said, " Our HPLC products did very well in the fourth quarter growing 10% on a constant currency basis and responding to an improvement in pharmaceutical industry spending, particularly in the United States. Our TA Instruments division continued to show good results with sales growth in the double digits. Our mass spectrometry business remained weak with demand for proteomics-focused Q-Tof systems particularly soft compared to the prior year's result.
Looking ahead to the first quarter and full year 2004, we are encouraged by the trends that we see in customer demand and by our plans for exciting new HPLC and mass spectrometry product introductions during the first half of the year."
