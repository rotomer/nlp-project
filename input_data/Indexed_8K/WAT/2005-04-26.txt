For Immediate Release
Contact: Gene Cassis, Vice President of Investor Relations, 508-482-2349
Milford, Massachusetts, April 26, 2005  Waters Corporation (NYSE/WAT) reported today first quarter 2005 sales of $268.3 million, an increase of 5% over sales of $255.1 million in the first quarter of 2004 with a foreign currency translation benefit accounting for approximately 2% of that growth. Quarterly earnings per diluted share (E.P.S.) were $0.38, compared to $0.33 for the first quarter in 2004. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding a charge for patent litigation expense in the first quarter of 2004, adjusted E.P.S. grew approximately 3% from $0.37 in the first quarter of 2004 to $0.38 in the first quarter of 2005.
Commenting on the quarter, Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "A decline in our business in Europe, slower growth in Asia and softer than anticipated global pharmaceutical spending tempered our growth in the first quarter. Sales to industrial customer segments for our Waters and TA Instruments Divisions grew at a healthy rate while ACQUITY UPLC and QTof Premier sales continued their positive momentum. Although sales and earnings growth rates for the quarter were weaker than we had anticipated in January, we are optimistic that stronger top-line growth will return as we move through the year."
