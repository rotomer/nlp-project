Item 8.01 Other Events
Legislation was passed during the fourth quarter of 2004 that provided an elective 85% dividends received deduction which permits U.S. corporations to repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries at an effective federal tax rate of 5.25 percent versus 35 percent before consideration of foreign tax credits. On July 12, 2005 the Board of Directors of Waters Corporation (the "Company") adopted resolutions to repatriate approximately $500 million as a qualified distribution in accordance with the legislation. During the third quarter of 2005, the Company will accrue a tax liability of approximately $22 million to $28 million for the federal, state and foreign taxes related to such repatriation.
Statements contained herein may be considered "forward-looking" statements under the "Safe Harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
