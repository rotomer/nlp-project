 Waters Corporation (NYSE:WAT) announced today that its third quarter 2005 sales grew 3% compared to sales in the third quarter of 2004. Foreign currency translation had a negligible effect on this growth rate. Earnings per diluted share (E.P.S.), including a tax provision related to a qualified dividends distribution under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, were $0.22. Excluding this tax provision, E.P.S. for the quarter would be $0.43, a 2% increase over the $0.42 E.P.S. reported in the third quarter of 2004.
Milford, Mass., October 25, 2005
Through the first nine months of 2005, sales for the Company were $826.0 million, a 6% increase over sales in the first nine months of 2004 of $780.4 million, with foreign currency translation benefiting sales growth by 1%. Through the first nine months of 2005, E.P.S. were $1.07 compared to $1.24 for the comparable period in 2004. On a non-GAAP basis and including the adjustments in the attached reconciliation, E.P.S. grew 7% in the nine months of 2005 to $1.27 from $1.19 in 2004.
Commenting on the quarter, Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "We are disappointed in our third quarter performance as sales of instruments to our largest pharmaceutical customers were weak due to delays and reductions in their capital spending plans. Unfortunately, revenue growth associated with our new product initiatives was insufficient to offset this market weakness."

Such factors and others are discussed more fully in the section entitled "Risk Factors" of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), which "Risk Factors" discussion is incorporated by reference in this release.
