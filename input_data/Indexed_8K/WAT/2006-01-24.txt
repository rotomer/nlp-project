Eliminating the effects of foreign currency translation, sales for the quarter grew 7%.

On a non-GAAP basis, including the adjustments noted in the attached reconciliation, E.P.S. grew 18% to $0.73 in the fourth quarter of 2005 from $0.62 in the fourth quarter of 2004.
Milford, Massachusetts, January 24, 2006
For the full year, sales grew 5% to $1,158 million in 2005 from $1,105 million in 2004. Foreign exchange translation had no material impact on the annual growth rate. On a GAAP basis, E.P.S. declined to $1.76 in 2005 from $1.82 in 2004. On a non-GAAP basis, including the adjustments noted in the attached reconciliation, E.P.S. grew 10% to $1.99 in 2005 from $1.81 in 2004.
Commenting on the quarter, Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "Our 7% organic sales growth and stronger E.P.S. growth in the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations. Strong growth in our chromatography business led by ACQUITY UPLC system shipments and strength in our Asian businesses were key factors in delivering these encouraging results."
