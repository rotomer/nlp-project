Contact: Gene Cassis, Vice President of Investor Relations, 508-482-2349
Milford, Massachusetts, February 17, 2006  Waters Corporation (NYSE/WAT) reported today it had entered into a settlement agreement with Agilent Technologies Deutschland GmbH resolving certain outstanding HPLC related litigation between them.
The settlement provides for the resolution of a finding of patent infringement by a court in the United Kingdom with respect to a portion of the pump technology used in Waters' Alliance HPLC instruments. In 2002, Waters discontinued the use of the patented technology and the settlement has no effect on the Company's ability to sell its Alliance HPLC instruments in the United Kingdom.
In connection with the settlement, Waters and its United Kingdom affiliate have been released from any claims of past infringement under the patent and Waters has agreed to make a one time payment to Agilent of 3.5 million British Pounds Sterling.
As a result of the settlement, Waters has revised its fourth quarter 2005 and full year 2005 results as previously reported in a press release on January 24, 2006, to include a pre-tax $3.1 million provision for damages and estimated remaining costs related to this matter. This has reduced GAAP earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2005 to $0.69 per diluted share from $0.71 per diluted share and to $1.74 per diluted share from $1.76 per diluted share for the full year 2005. Updated condensed financial statements are attached.
Similar patent infringement actions to the case noted above are currently pending in France and Germany. Waters believes, however, that any potential damages resulting from these ongoing disputes are unlikely to be materially different from amounts previously recorded.
Waters Corporation holds worldwide leading positions in three complementary analytical technologies  liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal analysis. These markets account for $4.5 - $5.0 billion of the overall $20 + billion analytical instrument market.
 
Certain statements contained herein are forward looking. Many factors could cause actual results to differ from these statements, in particular, uncertainties of litigation.
