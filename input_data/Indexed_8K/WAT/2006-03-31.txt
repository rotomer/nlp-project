Item 4.01. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant
On March 30, 2006, the Employee Benefits Administration Committee of Waters Technologies Corporation approved the dismissal of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Waters Employee Investment Plan (the "Plan"). The decision to dismiss PwC as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Plan was also approved by the Audit Committee of Waters Corporation's Board of Directors on March 30, 2006.
PwC's reports on the Plan's financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, and during the period from January 1, 2005 through March 30, 2006, there have been no disagreements between the Plan's management and PwC on any accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreement, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PwC, would have caused them to make reference thereto in their reports on the financial statements for such years.
No reportable events as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K have occurred within the Plan's fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 or during the period from January 1, 2005 through March 30, 2006.
The Plan has requested that PwC furnish a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") stating whether it agrees with the above statements. A copy of PwC's letter addressed to the SEC is filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 16.1.
On March 30, 2006, the Employee Benefits Administration Committee of Waters Technologies Corporation approved the appointment of Carlin, Charron & Rosen, LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Plan for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2005. The decision to appoint Carlin, Charron & Rosen, LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Plan was also approved by the Audit Committee of Waters Corporation's Board of Directors on March 30, 2006.
