For Immediate Release
Contact: Gene Cassis, Vice President of Investor Relations, 508-482-2349
Milford, Massachusetts, January 22, 2008  Waters Corporation (NYSE/WAT) reported fourth quarter 2007 sales of $437 million, an increase of 13% over sales of $387 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. In the quarter, foreign currency translation contributed 5% to the reported sales growth rate. On a GAAP basis, earnings per diluted share (E.P.S.) for the fourth quarter were $0.96, compared to $0.78 for the fourth quarter of 2006. On a non-GAAP basis, including the adjustments in the attached reconciliation, E.P.S. grew 17% to $0.98 from $0.84 in the fourth quarter of 2006.
For the full year, sales for the Company were $1.47 billion, an increase of 15% over sales of $1.28 billion in 2006. Foreign currency translation contributed 3% to the reported sales growth rate. E.P.S. for 2007 were $2.62 compared to $2.13 in 2006. On a non-GAAP basis, including adjustments in the attached reconciliation, E.P.S. grew 20% to $2.75 from $2.29 in 2006.
Commenting on the Company's performance, Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "2007 was a very successful year for Waters as sales grew 15%, non-GAAP E.P.S. were up 20% and cash from operations increased approximately 35%. The year's performance was highlighted by continued rapid uptake of our ACQUITY UPLC systems and significant new placements of SYNAPT HDMS instruments. Our fourth quarter financial results were less than our expectations primarily as a result of a higher than expected tax rate for 2007 and weaker sales in Japan."

This release may contain "forward-looking" statements regarding future results and events, including statements regarding expected financial results, future growth and customer demand that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For this purpose, any statements that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words, "believes", "anticipates", "plans", "expects", "intends", "appears", "estimates", "projects", and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements within this release for a variety of reasons, including and without limitation, the impact of changes in accounting principles or tax rates, the ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses, fluctuations in capital expenditures by the Company's customers, in particular large pharmaceutical companies, regulatory and/or administrative obstacles to the timely completion of purchase order documentation, introduction of competing products by other companies, such as improved research-grade mass spectrometers, and/or higher speed and/or more sensitive liquid chromatographs, pressures on prices from competitors and/or customers, regulatory obstacles to new product introductions, lack of acceptance of new products, other changes in the demands of the Company's healthcare and pharmaceutical company customers, changes in distribution of the Company's products, risks associated with lawsuits and other legal actions particularly involving claims for infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights, and foreign exchange rate fluctuations affecting translation of the Company's future non-U.S. operating results. Such factors and others are discussed more fully in the section entitled "Risk Factors" of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 and quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 29, 2007, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), which "Risk Factors" discussion is incorporated by reference in this release. The forward-looking statements included in this release represent the Company's estimates or views as of the date of this release report and should not be relied upon as representing the Company's estimates or views as of any date subsequent to the date of this release.
 
 
 
 
 
The adjusted net income per diluted share presented above is used by the management of the Company to measure operating performance with prior periods and is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The above reconciliation identifies items management has excluded as non-operational transactions. Management has excluded the purchased intangibles amortization, restructuring charge and impairment of equity investment from its non-GAAP adjusted amounts since management believes that these charges are not directly related to ongoing operations thereby providing investors with information that helps to compare ongoing operating performance. Management has also excluded the one-time contribution from its non-GAAP adjusted amounts to enable management and investors to prepare meaningful comparisons of the Company's operating results to prior and future periods.
