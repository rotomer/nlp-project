On October 9, 2008, Waters Corporation (the "Company") utilized existing cash balances to voluntarily prepay $150 million of debt originally borrowed by the Company on March 28, 2008 under its Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with certain financial institutions and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent dated March 25, 2008. The original maturity of the $150 million term loan facility provided by the Credit Agreement was January 11, 2012, and there was no penalty for prepaying the debt prior to that date. The Company prepaid the debt in order to reduce interest expense. The repayment of the debt effectively terminated all lending arrangements under the Credit Agreement as of October 9, 2008.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
