In the quarter, foreign currency translation increased sales growth rate by 4% and, on a currency neutral basis, sales increased by 6% in comparison to the prior year's first quarter sales. On a GAAP basis, earnings per diluted share (E.P.S.) for the first quarter of 2010 were $0.79, compared to $0.75 for the first quarter of 2009. On a non-GAAP basis, including the adjustments in the attached reconciliation, E.P.S. grew 9% to $0.81 from $0.74 in the first quarter of 2009.
Commenting on the Company's performance, Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "Strong demand for our new products and improving end-markets contributed to our sales growth in the first quarter. Shipments of our new instrument systems, including the Synapt G-2 and ACQUITY UPLC H-Class, ramped up nicely in the quarter while our TA Instruments sales returned to growth based on strong product positions and improving demand from industrial chemical customers."

This release may contain "forward-looking" statements regarding future results and events, including statements regarding expected financial results, future growth and customer demand that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For this purpose, any statements that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words, "believes", "anticipates", "plans", "expects", "intends", "appears", "estimates", "projects", and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements within this release for a variety of reasons, including and without limitation, the impact on demand among the Company's various market sectors from current economic difficulties and uncertainties; the impact of changes in accounting principles and practices or tax rates; shifts in taxable income in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates; the ability to access capital in volatile market conditions; the ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses; fluctuations in capital expenditures by the Company's customers, in particular large pharmaceutical companies; regulatory and/or administrative obstacles to the timely completion of purchase order documentation; introduction of competing products by other companies and loss of market share; pressures on prices from competitors and/or customers; regulatory obstacles to new product introductions; lack of acceptance of new products; other changes in the demands of the Company's healthcare and pharmaceutical company customers; changes in distribution of the Company's products; risks associated with lawsuits and other legal actions, particularly involving claims for infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights; and foreign exchange rate fluctuations potentially affecting translation of the Company's future non-U.S. operating results. Such factors and others are discussed more fully in the section entitled "Risk Factors" of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which "Risk Factors" discussion is incorporated by reference in this release.

The adjusted net income per diluted share presented above is used by the management of the Company to measure operating performance with prior periods and is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The above reconciliation identifies items management has excluded as non-operational transactions, net of the effective applicable statutory tax rates. Management has excluded the purchased intangibles amortization, restructuring costs, asset impairments, one-time tax benefits and acquisition-related costs from its non-GAAP adjusted amounts since management believes that these items are not directly related to ongoing operations, thereby providing management and investors with information that may help them to compare ongoing operating performance.
