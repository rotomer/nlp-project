Milford, Massachusetts, October 26, 2010  Waters Corporation (NYSE/WAT) reported today third quarter 2010 sales of $401 million, an increase of 7% over sales of $374 million in the third quarter of 2009. These quarterly sales include an adverse foreign currency translation impact of approximately 2%. On a GAAP basis, earnings per diluted share (E.P.S.) for the third quarter were $1.02 compared to $0.79 for the third quarter in 2009. On a non-GAAP basis, E.P.S. were up 21% to $0.98 in the third quarter of 2010 from $0.81 in the third quarter of 2009. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP E.P.S. is attached.
Through the first nine months of 2010, sales for the Company were $1,160 million, an increase of 8% in comparison to sales of $1,070 million in the first nine months of 2009. Foreign currency translation did not contribute meaningfully to sales growth during the first nine months of 2010. E.P.S. for the first nine months of 2010 were $2.71 compared to $2.26 for the comparable period in 2009. On a non-GAAP basis and including adjustments on the attached reconciliation, E.P.S grew 17% in the first nine months of 2010 to $2.72 from $2.33 in 2009.
Commenting on the quarter, Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "Our sales growth in the third quarter was significantly driven by shipments of our new instrument systems, including ACQUITY H-Class UPLC and our research-focused mass spectrometry platforms. Our pharmaceutical and chemical end markets continued to show strength and, geographically, business in the Americas and Asia accelerated global demand."

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT
This release may contain "forward-looking" statements regarding future results and events, including statements regarding expected financial results, future growth and customer demand that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For this purpose, any statements that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words, "believes", "anticipates", "plans", "expects", "intends", "appears", "estimates", "projects", and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements within this release for a variety of reasons, including and without limitation, the impact on demand among the Company's various market sectors from current economic difficulties and uncertainties; increased regulatory burdens as the Company's business evolves, especially with respect to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, among others; shifts in taxable income in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates; the outcome of tax examinations or changes in respective country legislation affecting the Company's effective tax rate; the ability to access capital in volatile market conditions; fluctuations in capital expenditures by the Company's customers, in particular large pharmaceutical companies; the ability to sustain and enhance service and consumable demand from the Company's installed base of instruments; regulatory and/or administrative obstacles to the timely completion of purchase order documentation; introduction of competing products by other companies and loss of market share; pressures on prices from competitors and/or customers; regulatory, economic and competitive obstacles to new product introductions; other changes in demand from the effect of mergers and acquisitions by the Company's customers; environmental and logistical obstacles affecting the distribution of products; risks associated with lawsuits and other legal actions, particularly involving claims for infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights; the impact of changes in accounting principles and practices; and foreign exchange rate fluctuations potentially affecting translation of the Company's future non-U.S. operating results. Such factors and others are discussed more fully in the section entitled "Risk Factors" of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 and quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended July 3, 2010 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which "Risk Factors" discussion is incorporated by reference in this release. The forward-looking statements included in this release represent the Company's estimates or views as of the date of this release report and should not be relied upon as representing the Company's estimates or views as of any date subsequent to the date of this release.
 
 
 
 
The adjusted net income per diluted share presented above is used by the management of the Company to measure operating performance with prior periods and is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The above reconciliation identifies items management has excluded as non-operational transactions, net of the effective applicable statutory tax rates. Management has excluded the purchased intangibles amortization, non-income tax audit settlement, asset impairments, lease termination costs, restructuring costs, reversal of income tax reserves upon audit settlement, one-time tax benefits and acquisition-related costs from its non-GAAP adjusted amounts since management believes that these items are not directly related to ongoing operations, thereby providing management and investors with information that may help them to compare ongoing operating performance.
