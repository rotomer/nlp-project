ITEM: Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
 
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2 below):
 
 
 
This current report on Form 8-K/A (this "Amendment") amends a current report on Form 8-K, filed May 13, 2011 (the "Original Filing"), in which Waters Corporation (the "Company") reported voting results for its annual meeting of stockholders held on May 10, 2011, including the voting results for both the Company's non-binding stockholder advisory vote on the compensation of its named executive officers (the "Say-on-Pay Vote") and the Company's non-binding stockholder advisory vote regarding the frequency of future Say-on-Pay Votes. Except for the foregoing, this Amendment does not modify or update any other disclosure contained in the Original Filing.
As previously reported in the Original Filing, more than a majority of shares voting at the 2011 annual meeting voted, on a non-binding advisory basis, in favor of an annual frequency for future Say-on-Pay Votes. The Company intends, in light of that vote, to hold future Say-on-Pay votes annually, until the next required vote on the frequency of Say-on-Pay votes.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
