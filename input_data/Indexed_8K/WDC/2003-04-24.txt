The year-ago results included tax benefits and investment gains totaling $4.0 million. Average selling prices were $68 in the March 2003 quarter, down $5 from the unusually strong December quarter, but essentially flat with both the September and June quarters of calendar 2002.

Western Digital Reports EPS of $.26, Revenue of $706 Million, 10.3 Million Units Shipped For Fiscal Q3; Year-Over-Year Revenue Growth Of 19%, Net Income Rises 184% Page 2 The Company generated $99 million in cash flow from operations in the March quarter, reflecting balanced linearity of shipments and solid asset management. The cash balance at quarter's end totaled $347 million, exceeding the cash position at the end of December, despite a cash payment of $74 million in the quarter, which retired substantially all of the Company's remaining convertible debt. "These results demonstrate healthy industry demand for hard drives and continued strong execution by the Western Digital team in achieving customer satisfaction and maximizing profitability through excellent quality, predictable supply, and operational excellence," said Matt Massengill, chairman and chief executive officer of Western Digital. "With this focus, we were able to significantly improve our position with leading PC OEM customers in the March quarter." On the new product front in the third quarter, Massengill noted that Western Digital "continued to meet the industry's demand for high-capacity, high-performance desktop hard drives with shipments of our new WD Caviar(R) 7200 RPM 250 GB drive based on 80 GB-per-platter technology and we successfully launched the WD Raptor(TM) hard drive in the enterprise market -- the industry's first 10,000 RPM Serial ATA drive."
