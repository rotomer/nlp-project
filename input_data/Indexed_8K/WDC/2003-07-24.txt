     "Excellent execution by the Western Digital organization resulted in another quarter of strong financial performance, capping an outstanding year of growth and profitability," said Matt Massengill, chairman and chief executive officer of Western Digital. "We grew our unit volumes in what is traditionally the industry's slowest period by meeting customer needs in all channels.
     "We continued our technology leadership in the desktop space with the industry's largest and fastest hard drive  WD Caviar 7200 RPM 250 gigabyte model  and we have qualified and are shipping 80 gigabyte-per-platter technology to all of our major OEM customers. In the enterprise market, we expanded our Serial ATA (SATA) product line with the WD Caviar SE SATA drive, complementing our initial Enterprise SATA product, the WD Raptor 10,000 RPM model. We have seen strong response to both products from customers and we are pleased with the adoption of the interface by the enterprise market.
     "From a balance sheet perspective, we increased our cash position to $393 million as we generated $44 million in cash from operations in the quarter through our ongoing focus on cash management. For the full year, we generated $281 million in cash from operations."
