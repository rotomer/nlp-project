Under the terms of the settlement, Western Digital will make a one-time payment to Cirrus Logic on or before October 17, 2003 of $45 million.

Updated statements of income and balance sheets are attached to this release. The company's financial statements will be filed in its Form 10-K as scheduled in late September. "We are pleased to resolve this long-standing dispute," said Matt Massengill, chairman and chief executive officer of Western Digital. "With this settlement, we avoid the continued expense and distraction of this litigation and potential trial, and remain focused on our business." In July 2001, Western Digital stopped paying Cirrus Logic for read channel chips that had been delivered, cancelled all outstanding purchase orders and filed suit against Cirrus Logic for breach of contract and other claims resulting from Cirrus' role as a strategic supplier of read channel chips for the company's hard drives. In August 2001, Cirrus Logic filed a cross-complaint, seeking compensatory damages of approximately $53 million, including the disputed payable of $26.5 million mentioned above. The matter was scheduled to go to trial in December 2003. Western Digital has not purchased read channel devices from Cirrus Logic since July 2001 and all of its current and planned future products incorporate read channel chips from other suppliers.
