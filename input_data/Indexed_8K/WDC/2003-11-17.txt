Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure.
     In a meeting today with analysts in Las Vegas, Matt Massengill, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, expects to provide an update on certain current conditions in the hard drive industry, consistent with what was previously disclosed at the JP Morgan Small Cap conference on November 13, 2003. Specifically, Mr. Massengill will indicate that PC OEM demand is good, consistent with expectations and normal seasonal demand patterns. In addition, distribution sell through has been slower than is typical for October, however pricing has been better than expected. Therefore on balance, industry conditions are consistent with the Company's expectations at this point in the quarter.
