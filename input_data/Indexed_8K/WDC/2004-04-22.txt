FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
:
LAKE FOREST, Calif. - Apr. 22, 2004 - Western Digital Corp. (NYSE: WDC) today reported revenue of $749 million on shipments of approximately 11.8 million units, and net income of $47.9 million, or $.22 per share, for its third fiscal quarter ended March 26, 2004.
       A year ago in the March 2003 quarter, Western Digital produced revenue of $706 million, shipped approximately 10.3 million units and earned $54.5 million, or $.26 per share. On a year-over-year basis, revenue grew six percent and units increased 15 percent.
       With an industry-wide focus on desktop hard drive inventory levels in the distribution channel at the end of the December quarter, Western Digital lowered the total number of units in channel inventory and ended the March quarter with about five weeks.
       "We are very pleased with our solid financial performance in the March quarter," said Matt Massengill, chairman and chief executive officer of Western Digital. "We continued to execute well in our core desktop business, we demonstrated sound market discipline in managing distribution channel inventories, and we continued to make meaningful progress toward our strategic goal of growing our business in adjacent storage markets such as personal entertainment, enterprise computing, and mobile computing.
