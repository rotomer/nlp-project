Item 12.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition
           On July 29, 2004, Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") announced financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended July 2, 2004. A copy of the press release making this announcement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the Company's Investor Information Summary for the fiscal quarter ended July 2, 2004 is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated herein by reference.
           The Company's press release reports net income and earnings per share on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis for the full fiscal year ended July 2, 2004 and for the fourth fiscal quarter and full fiscal year ended June 27, 2003.  The non-GAAP measures presented in the press release for the full fiscal year ended July 2, 2004 exclude $50.4 million of first quarter start-up expenses and other one-time charges related to the Company's acquisition of Read-Rite Corp. in July 2003 and their related tax effects. The non-GAAP measures presented for the fourth fiscal quarter and year ended June 27, 2003 exclude a $3.4 million gain on the sale of investment securities, an $18.5 million loss on the settlement of litigation and their related tax effects.  The Company believes that the non-GAAP measures presented in the press release are useful to investors in comparing the results of the quarter and the full fiscal year with prior periods because they provide investors with a basis to measure the core operating performance of the Company's business against prior periods without regard to the start-up expenses and other one-time charges described above.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP.  As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
 
 
 
           Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

       Matt Massengill, chairman and chief executive officer of Western Digital, stated: "Sustained execution of our business model is serving us well in a demanding hard drive industry environment. We have strengthened customer relationships in our core desktop hard drive market through predictable supply of high quality products and we continued to expand our business in adjacent storage markets such as digital video recorders and non-PC, IT applications with Serial ATA hard drives. Relative to the hard drive industry, we achieved outstanding financial results, validating the low-cost structure we have put in place to remain profitable even in the most challenging of business environments.
       "Reflecting our focus on cash generation, we realized $73 million cash from operations in the quarter. On a full fiscal year basis, we generated $190 million cash flow from operations and ended with $378 million of cash, even with our acquisition of the Read-Rite assets and the related volume production ramp of heads," said Massengill. The company also repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares of its common stock in the quarter at a total cost of $16 million.
       The company indicated that fourth quarter pricing in the distribution channel was very aggressive and that it experienced a higher mix of business with OEM customers, which is typically lower gross margin business than distribution. These factors resulted in lower total gross margins of 13.5 percent.
