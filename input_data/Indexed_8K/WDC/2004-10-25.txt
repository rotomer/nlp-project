FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
LAKE FOREST, Calif.  Oct. 25, 2004  Reflecting sustained strong financial performance and operational excellence, Western Digital Corp. (NYSE: WDC) today reported revenues of $824 million on shipments of approximately 14.2 million units, and net income of $30.4 million, or $.14 per share, for its first fiscal quarter ended Oct. 1, 2004.
     A year ago in the Sept. 2003 quarter, WD produced revenue of $714 million, shipped approximately 11.3 million units and earned $5.0 million, or $0.02 per share. On a year-over-year basis, revenue grew 15 percent and units increased 26 percent. Net income in the year-ago period included $50.4 million of start-up expenses and other one-time charges related to the Read-Rite asset acquisition.

performance over the last several quarters and in our better-than-expected first quarter results. As a result of this commitment, we have been able to earn higher levels of business with leading OEM customers." In the first quarter, OEM customers accounted for approximately 59 percent of revenue, versus 53 percent of revenue in both the preceding and year ago periods.
     "In the first quarter, we met seasonally stronger demand from our customers in the desktop PC and personal entertainment markets," Massengill said. "We shipped approximately 1.8 million hard drives into personal entertainment applications such as game consoles and digital video recorders, as we continued to expand our presence in markets outside our traditional stronghold of desktop PCs. As part of that same growth strategy, we successfully launched volume production of our WD Scorpio family of mobile hard drives to address the growing notebook PC market and of our WD Caviar RAID Edition hard drives, which are designed and manufactured to deliver enterprise-class reliability in a host of server applications.
     "From a balance sheet perspective, our cash at the end of the quarter grew to $405 million, an increase of $27 million from the June quarter. We generated $93 million in cash from operations, and we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares of common stock for approximately $15 million, for a total of approximately 4.1 million shares repurchased at a total cost of $31 million since the program's inception in May 2004."
