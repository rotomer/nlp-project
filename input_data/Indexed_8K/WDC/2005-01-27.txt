drives for consumer electronics applications, an increase of over 200 percent increase from the year-ago period.
     "In addition to the robust market demand, the second quarter results demonstrate the strength of the WD business model and our ongoing operational excellence," said Matt Massengill, chairman and chief executive officer of Western Digital. The demand for hard drives in all segments was strong, especially in desktop and consumer electronics applications, and WD continued to serve these markets with world-class quality and highly reliable products.
     "We expanded our coverage of high-growth markets in the second quarter," said Massengill, noting that the company shipped in volume its 2.5-inch WD Scorpio drives for mobile computing applications and shipped its new 320 GB WD Caviar hard drive for the high-capacity markets. Additionally, the company shipped more than 4 million Serial ATA hard drives in the quarter. Last week, the company announced its entry into the miniature hard drive market with a 6 GB one-inch hard drive for handheld consumer applications.
     From a balance sheet perspective, the company's cash at the end of the quarter grew to $493 million, an increase of $87 million from the September quarter. The company generated $143 million in cash from operations, and it repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of common stock for approximately $8 million. Since the inception in May 2004 of the company's share repurchase program, it has repurchased approximately 5.1 million shares at a total cost of $39.3 million.
