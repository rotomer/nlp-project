     "The supply/demand environment in the hard drive industry was well balanced throughout the quarter, which translated into an improved pricing environment," said Matt Massengill, chairman and chief executive officer of WD. "Combined with strong demand for high capacity hard drives, improved traction in non-desktop PC markets and our ongoing cost and quality leadership, we produced stellar results in the fiscal third quarter."
     WD indicated that 23 percent of its Q3 revenue was derived from non-desktop PC sources including consumer electronics, enterprise applications, notebook PCs and retail sales. Seventy-seven percent of the company's Q3 revenue came from hard drives configured into desktop PCs. This compares with a mix in the year-ago quarter of 14 percent non-desktop PC revenue, 86 percent desktop PC revenue. In the last year, WD has funded, developed and launched several new products aimed at the consumer electronics segments for personal and digital video recorders (PVR/DVR) and handheld devices and at the markets for notebook PCs, enterprise and retail hard drives.
     The investment community conference call to discuss these results and the company's outlook will be broadcast live over the Internet today at 2 p.m. PDT/5 p.m. EDT and archived at the following link:  click on Conference Calls.
