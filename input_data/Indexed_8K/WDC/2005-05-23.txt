Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
At a meeting on May 18, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company established the performance goals for the cash bonus awards under the Western Digital Corporation Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan") for the first half of fiscal year 2006. The Committee determined that funding of the Plan for this period will be based upon accomplishment of specific EPS and revenue targets, in various combinations. These predetermined performance goals were recommended to, and approved by, the non-management members of the Board of Directors on May 19, 2005. Under the Plan, certain employees of the Company, including the Companys executive officers, may be awarded cash bonus awards based on the Companys achievement of these predetermined performance goals. For executive officers, a target bonus amount has been established previously as a percentage of base salary ranging from 65% to 100% of base salary. Depending upon the Companys achievement of these pr edetermined performance goals, the Plan may fund based on a percentage of the target bonus amount (ranging from 0% to 200% of the target). However, individual participation in the Plan is based on individual performance, and actual awards may vary upward or downward.
