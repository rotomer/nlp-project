Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
On July 4, 2005 Western Digital Corporation and Western Digital Technologies, Inc. (collectively "Western Digital") entered into a Settlement and License Agreement (the "Agreement") with Papst Licensing GmbH & Co. KG, a German corporation ("Papst"). In connection with the settlement, WD will make a one-time payment of $24 million to Papst on or before July 31, 2005. In exchange, Papst has agreed to dismiss with prejudice its lawsuit pending against Western Digital, grant to Western Digital a fully-paid license to certain patents owned by Papst, and release Western Digital of all past, present, and future claims alleging infringement by Western Digital of those Papst patents. The Agreement resolves all outstanding litigation between the two companies without any admission of infringement by Western Digital. For Western Digital, the settlement will result in a net charge to operations of $19 million, which will be reflected in Western Digital's financial statements for the quarter ended July 1, 2005 . As of April 1, 2005, Western Digital had cash and short-term investments of $574 million, and had generated $421 million in cash from operations for the twelve months then ended.
