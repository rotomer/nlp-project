Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On July 28, 2005, Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") announced financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended July 1, 2005. A copy of the press release making this announcement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the Company's Investor Information Summary for the fiscal quarter ended July 1, 2005 is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
     The Company's press release reports net income and earnings per share on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis for the fourth fiscal quarter and full fiscal year ended July 1, 2005 and for the full fiscal year ended July 2, 2004. The non-GAAP measures presented in the press release for the fourth fiscal quarter and full fiscal year ended July 1, 2005 exclude a $19 million charge for the settlement of a lawsuit. Including this item, net income on a GAAP basis was $41.2 million, or $.19 per share, for the fourth fiscal quarter ended July 1, 2005 and $198.4 million, or $.91 per share, for the full fiscal year ended July 1, 2005. The non-GAAP measures presented for the full fiscal year ended July 2, 2004 exclude $50.4 million of start-up expenses and other one-time charges related to the Company's acquisition of the assets of Read-Rite Corp. in July 2003, reduced by $1.3 million, the amount of tax expense that would have been recorded had these charges not been incurred. Including these items, net income on a GAAP basis was $151.3 million, or $.70 per share, for the full fiscal year ended July 2, 2004. The Company believes that the non-GAAP measures presented in the press release are useful to investors in comparing the results of the quarter and the full fiscal year with prior periods because they provide investors with a basis to measure the core operating performance of the Company's business against prior periods without regard to the settlement charge, start-up expenses and other one-time charges described above. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP. As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
     In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

     From a balance sheet perspective, the company's cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter grew to $598 million, an increase of $24 million from the March quarter. The company generated $113 million in cash from operations in the June quarter. It also repurchased 1.7 million shares for approximately $21.7 million in the June quarter. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in May 2004, the company has repurchased 6.7 million shares for approximately $61 million.
     "We continue to increase our presence in markets for hard drives such as notebook PCs, enterprise applications and personal and digital video recorders while maintaining our leadership in the high-volume desktop PC business," said Matt Massengill, chairman and chief executive officer of Western Digital. "We saw healthy demand in all of our markets in what is typically the slowest quarter of the year for our industry."
     WD indicated that 23 percent of its Q4 revenue was derived from sources including consumer electronics, enterprise applications, notebook PCs and retail sales. Seventy-seven percent of the company's fourth quarter revenue came from hard drives configured into desktop PCs. This compares with a mix in the year-ago quarter of 15 percent non-desktop PC revenue, 85 percent desktop PC revenue. In fiscal 2005, WD funded, developed or launched several new products aimed at the consumer electronics segments for personal and digital video recorders (PVR/DVR) and handheld devices and at the markets for notebook PCs, enterprise and retail consumer storage.
