     In the March quarter, the company continued to broaden its business beyond the desktop PC market into segments such as notebook, consumer electronics, enterprise and branded products. Twenty-nine percent of the March quarter revenue came from the new markets, 71 percent from the desktop PC business. This compares with a mix in the year-ago quarter of 23 percent non-desktop PC revenue and 77 percent desktop PC revenue.
     Since January, eight new WD products have begun shipping into five different growth markets  desktop, notebook, enterprise, consumer electronics and branded products. Reflecting the company's significant investments in research and development and capital spending over the last three years, WD is now able to address 90 percent of the worldwide hard drive market, which in calendar year 2005 was a $28 billion industry.
     From a balance sheet perspective, the company generated $119 million in cash from operations during the March quarter, ending with total cash and short-term investments of $674 million. During the quarter, the company repurchased 0.9 million shares of its common stock for approximately $17.5 million. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in May 2004, the company has repurchased 9.7 million shares for approximately $105 million. The company also increased capital expenditures to $104 million in the quarter, which includes its purchase of the previously-leased Fremont, Calif. wafer fabrication facility.
     "The March quarter results demonstrate a continuation of our strong and consistent financial performance and penetration of new markets," said Arif Shakeel, WD's president and chief executive officer. "Providing customers with high quality, cost-effective hard drives at capacity points they require  when they need them  is of tremendous value in all the markets that we serve: notebook, consumer electronics, enterprise, branded products and desktop. As these markets grow, we have significant opportunities to leverage our investments into continued strong financial performance."
