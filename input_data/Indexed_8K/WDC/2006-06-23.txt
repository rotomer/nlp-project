Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
At a meeting on June 20, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board established the performance goals for the cash bonus awards under the Western Digital Corporation Incentive Compensation Plan (the "ICP Plan") for the first half of fiscal year 2007. The Compensation Committee determined that funding of the ICP Plan for this period will be based upon accomplishment of specific revenue targets and earnings per share targets, in various combinations. Under the ICP Plan, the Companys executive officers and certain other employees may be awarded cash bonus awards based on the Companys achievement of these predetermined performance goals. For executive officers, a target bonus amount has been established as a percentage of base salary ranging from 65% to 100% of base salary. Depending upon the Companys achievement of these predetermined performance goals, the ICP Plan may fund based on a percentage of the target bonus amount (ranging from 0% to 200% of the target). However, individual participation in the ICP Plan is based on individual performance, and actual awards may vary upward or downward.
