Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
As previously announced, on September 13, 2006 Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") filed a Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission in which it reported that it had not yet filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 (the "2006 Form 10-K") and that it might not be able to do so on or before September 28, 2006 (the fifteenth calendar day following the prescribed due date for the 2006 Form 10-K). The Company has not filed the 2006 Form 10-K and, as a result, on September 29, 2006, the Company received a letter from the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") notifying it that it is subject to the procedures specified in Section 802.01E (SEC Annual Report Timely Filing Criteria) of the NYSEs Listed Company Manual. This section provides that the NYSE will monitor the Company and the filing status of the 2006 Form 10-K. If the Company has not filed its 2006 Form 10-K within six months of the filing due date of the 2006 Form 10-K, the NYSE will determ ine whether the Company should be given up to an additional six months to file its 2006 Form 10-K. If the NYSE determines that such an additional time period is not appropriate, suspension and delisting procedures would be commenced pursuant to Section 804.00 of the Listed Company Manual. The Company plans to file its 2006 Form 10-K as promptly as practicable after the completion of work by a Special Committee of its Board of Directors that is conducting a Company-initiated, voluntary review of the Companys historical stock option grants.
