Item 5.04 Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Registrant's Employee Benefit Plans.
(b) On October 27, 2006 and in accordance with Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Regulation BTR under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") announced that it had notified its directors and executive officers that they would be prohibited from directly or indirectly purchasing, selling or otherwise acquiring or transferring any shares of Company common stock or other equity securities of the Company, including pursuant to options to acquire common stock, beginning at 2:30pm on November 1, 2006. At such time, the Company also announced that the trading restriction was expected to end on the date that the Company filed its Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2006 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today, the Company filed its Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2006 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, beginning on Tuesday, November 21, 2006, employees participating in the Company's 401(k) Plan will once again be permitted to elect to purchase shares of the Company's common stock under that plan. Accordingly, the Company has today notified its directors and executive officers that the trading restriction that became effective on November 1, 2006 pursuant to Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Regulation BTR under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, will terminate on Tuesday, November 21, 2006 concurrent with the right and the ability of the Companys employees to purchase shares of the Companys common stock under the Companys 401(k) plan as described above. As a result, beginning Tuesday, November 21, 2006, directors and executive officers will once again be permitted to, directly or indirectly, purchase, sell or otherwise acquire or transfer shares of Company common stock or other equity securities of the Company, including pursuant to options to acquire common stock (in all cases, subject to compliance with any legal requirements that may apply to their particular set of facts and circumstances, including insider trading restrictions).
