FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
:
LAKE FOREST, Calif.  Jul. 26, 2007  Western Digital Corp. (NYSE: WDC) today reported its financial results for its fiscal year 2007 and fourth quarter ended June 29, 2007.
     The company's results for the fiscal year reflected strong year-over-year performance, with revenue of $5.5 billion and operating income of $415 million. Net income was $585 million, or $2.59 per share, compared to $395 million, or $1.76 per share for the prior year. The 2007 and 2006 net income amounts included income tax benefits of $147 million and $22 million, respectively, related to adjustments to the value of the company's deferred tax assets.
     These results represented increases in revenue of 26 percent over the prior year's $4.3 billion, unit shipment growth of 32 percent from 73.3 million to 96.5 million, and growth in cash and short term investments from $699 million to $907 million. On a year-over-year basis, the company expanded its share of revenue from newer markets from 29 percent

to 43 percent. The company's newer market revenue includes hard drives for notebook PCs, consumer electronics, enterprise applications and WD branded products.
     For the fourth quarter, revenue totaled $1.4 billion on shipments of approximately 24.9 million units, with net income of $233 million, or $1.03 per share. The fourth quarter net income includes a $147 million benefit to income taxes reflecting a favorable adjustment to the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets.
     The June quarter results also represented strong year-over-year performance, including growth in revenue and unit shipments of 26 percent and 30 percent, respectively. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported revenue of $1.1 billion, unit shipments of 19.2 million, and net income of $120 million, or $.53 per share. Net income in the year-ago period included $13 million in favorable adjustments to gross margin related to the resolution of certain items that impacted amounts previously recorded as cost, and a $22 million benefit to income taxes related to an adjustment to the value of the company's deferred tax assets.
     Forty-six percent of Q4 revenue was derived from newer market sources, while 54 percent came from hard drives configured into desktop PCs. This compares with a mix in the year-ago quarter of 34 percent newer markets versus 66 percent desktop PC revenue.
     The company shipped 3.8 million 2.5-inch mobile drives and 2.7 million 3.5-inch units for the PVR/DVR market, compared with 1.6 million and 2.2 million, respectively, a year ago.
