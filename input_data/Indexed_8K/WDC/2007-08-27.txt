Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On July 26, 2007, Western Digital Corporation ("Western Digital") announced financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended June 29, 2007, including an income tax benefit of $147 million related to an adjustment to the valuation allowance of Western Digital's deferred tax assets. In the course of finalizing its annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended June 29, 2007, Western Digital determined that the deferred tax asset and the related valuation allowance should be reduced by $21 million and that the income tax benefit should have been $126 million. Given this change, net income for fiscal year 2007 was $564 million, or $2.50 per share, and net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $212 million, or $0.94 per share. The change does not impact the Company's previously announced operating income or cash flows from operations.
     In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Item 2.02, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
