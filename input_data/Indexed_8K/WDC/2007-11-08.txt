Voting

     (a) Except as otherwise provided by or pursuant to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question and which shall have been held by and registered in the name of the stockholder on the books of this Corporation on the date fixed pursuant to Section 2.10 of these By-laws as the record for the determination of stockholder entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting.
     (b) Shares of its own stock belonging to this Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by this Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes. Persons holding stock of this Corporation in a fiduciary capacity shall be entitled to vote such stock. Persons whose stock is pledged shall be entitled to vote, unless in the transfer by the pledgor on the books of this Corporation the pledgor shall have expressly empowered the pledge to vote thereon. Stock having voting power that is held of record in the names of two or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants in common, tenants by entirety or otherwise, or with respect to which two or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship, shall be voted in accordance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "General Corporation Law").
     (c) Any such voting rights may be exercised by the stockholder entitled thereto in person or by the stockholder's proxy; provided, however, that no proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date unless said proxy shall provide for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with
 
an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. The attendance at any meeting of a stockholder who may theretofore have given a proxy which is not irrevocable shall not have the effect of revoking the same, unless the stockholder shall attend the meeting and vote in person or deliver to the Secretary a revocation of the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date. At any meeting of the stockholders at which a quorum is present all matters, except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-Laws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to this Corporation, or applicable law or pursuant to any regulation applicable to this Corporation or its securities, shall be decided by the vote of a majority in voting power of the stockholders present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon. The vote at any meeting of the stockholders on any question need not be by written ballot, unless so directed by the chairman of the meeting. On a vote by ballot each ballot shall be signed by the stockholder voting, or by his or her proxy, if there be such proxy, and it shall state the number of shares voted.
     The officer who has charge of the stock ledger shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of meeting or (b) during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of this Corporation. The list of stockholders must also be open to examination at the meeting as required by applicable law.

In the event that no inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability.

2.11 Stockholder Proposals and Nominations.
     (a) Annual Meetings of Stockholders.
          (i) Nominations of persons for election to the Board and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders only (A) pursuant to this Corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto), (B) by or at the direction of the Board or (C) by any stockholder of this Corporation who was a stockholder of record of this Corporation at the time the notice provided for in this Section 2.11 is delivered to the Secretary of this Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.11. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order for a proposal or director nomination to be considered at the 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "2005 Annual Meeting"), stockholders must give written notice of any proposal or nomination of a director to the Secretary of this Corporation at the principal executive offices of this Corporation not less than 60 days nor more than 120 days prior to the scheduled date of the 2005 Annual Meeting, regardless of any postponements, deferrals or adjournments of the 2005 Annual Meeting to a later date. The 2005 Annual Meeting is currently scheduled for November 17, 2005. Stockholder proposals or nominations for director that do not meet the notice requirements set forth above will not be acted upon at the 2005 Annual Meeting.
          (ii) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (C) of paragraph (a)(i) of this Section 2.11, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of this Corporation and any such proposed business other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board must constitute a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of this Corporation not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one
 
hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than seventy (70) days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by this Corporation). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth: (A) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (1) all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and (2) such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; (B) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the By-laws, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (1) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on this Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (2) the class and number of shares of capital stock of this Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, (3) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of this Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (4) a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group which intends (x) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of this Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (y) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements of this Section 2.11 shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified this Corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal or nomination at an annual meeting in compliance with applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholder's proposal or nomination has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by this Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. This Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of this Corporation.
          (iii) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 2.11 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by this Corporation naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this
 
Section 2.11 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of this Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by this Corporation.
     (b) Special Meetings of Stockholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to this Corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to this Corporation's notice of meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board or (ii) provided that the Board has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of this Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this Section 2.11 is delivered to the Secretary of this Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting upon such election and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.11. In the event this Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in this Corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 2.11 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of this Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
     (c) General.
          (i) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.11 shall be eligible to be elected at an annual or special meeting of stockholders of this Corporation to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.11. Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (A) to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.11 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such stockholder's nominee or proposal in compliance with such stockholder's representation as required by clause (a)(ii)(C)(4) of this Section 2.11) and (B) if any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 2.11, to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.11, unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of this Corporation to present a nomination or proposed business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed
 
business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by this Corporation. For purposes of this Section 2.11, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.
          (ii) For purposes of this Section 2.11, "public announcement" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by this Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
          (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.11, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2.11. Nothing in this Section 2.11 shall be deemed to affect any rights (A) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals or nominations in this Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act or (B) of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation.
     The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced at the meeting by the person presiding over the meeting. The Board may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board, the person presiding over any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and to adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such presiding person, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board or prescribed by the presiding person of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (a) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (b) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (c) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of this Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the presiding person of the meeting shall determine; (d) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (e) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. The presiding person at any meeting of stockholders, in addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a matter or business was not properly brought before the meeting and if such presiding person should so determine, such presiding person shall so declare to the meeting and any such matter or business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted or considered. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board or the person presiding over the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.
2.12
Conduct of Meetings.
 
     Subject to the requirements of the General Corporation Law, the property, business and affairs of this Corporation shall be managed by the Board.
3.01
General Powers
.
     The Board shall consist of one or more members, the number thereof to be determined from time to time by resolution of the Board. Directors need not be stockholders. Each of the directors of this Corporation shall hold office until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and shall qualify or until he or she shall resign or shall have been removed in the manner provided in these By-laws.
3.02
Number and Term of Office
.
     The directors shall be elected annually by the stockholders of this Corporation. Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.05 below, each director shall be elected by the vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to such director at any annual or special meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, provided that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the nominees receiving the greatest number of votes of the shares represented in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors, up to the number of directors to be elected, shall be the directors. For purposes of this Section 3.03, a "majority of the votes cast" means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director. If an incumbent director is not reelected but would otherwise remain in office until his or her successor is elected and qualified, the director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board, which may be conditioned upon acceptance of such resignation by the Board. If a resignation is so conditioned, the Governance Committee of the Board, or such other committee designated by the Board pursuant to Section 3.14 below, will evaluate any such resignation in light of the best interests of this Corporation and its stockholders and will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject such resignation or whether other action should be taken with respect thereto. In making its recommendation, such committee may consider any factors it deems relevant, including the director's qualifications, the director's past and expected future contributions to this Corporation, the overall composition of the Board and whether accepting the tendered resignation would cause this Corporation to fail to satisfy or otherwise comply with any applicable rule or regulation (including NYSE listing requirements and federal securities laws). The Board will act on the recommendation of such committee and will publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within ninety (90) days from the date of the certification of the election results. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the decision of the Board or Board committee.
3.03
Election of Directors
.
     If no directors receive the requisite majority vote at an annual or special meeting held for the election of directors where the number of nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected, the incumbent Board will nominate a new slate of directors and hold a special meeting for the purpose of electing those nominees within 180 days after the certification of the stockholder vote at the prior meeting. In this circumstance, the incumbent Board will continue to serve until new directors are duly elected and qualified.
     Any director of this Corporation may resign at any time by giving notice in writing or by electronic transmission to the Board or to the Secretary of this Corporation. Any such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein, or, if the time
3.04
Resignations
.
 
be not specified, it shall take effect immediately upon its receipt by the Board or the Secretary; and unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.
     Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any vacancy in the Board, whether because of death, resignation, disqualification, an increase in the number of directors, or any other cause, may be filled by vote of the majority of the remaining directors, although less than a quorum, or by a plurality of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders. Each director so chosen to fill a vacancy shall hold office until his or her successor shall have been elected and shall qualify or until he or she shall resign or shall have been removed in the manner provided in these By-laws. If there are no directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by the General Corporation Law.
3.05
Vacancies
.
     The Board may hold any of its meetings at such place or places within or without the State of Delaware as the Board may from time to time by resolution designate or as shall be designated by the person or persons calling the meeting or in the notice or a waiver of notice of any such meeting. Directors may participate in any regular or special meeting of the Board by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment pursuant to which all persons participating in the meeting of the Board can hear each other, and such participation shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.
3.06
Place of Meeting, Etc
.
     The Board shall meet as soon as practicable after each annual election of directors and notice of such first meeting shall not be required, provided a quorum shall be present; or such meeting may be held at such time and place as shall be specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of the Board, or as shall be specified in a waiver given by each person entitled to notice.
3.07
First Meeting
.
     Regular meetings of the Board shall be held at such times and places as the Board shall from time to time by resolution determine. If any day fixed for a regular meeting shall be a legal holiday at the place where the meeting is to be held, then the meeting shall be held at the same time and place on the next succeeding business day not a legal holiday.
3.08
Regular Meetings
.
     Special meetings of the Board for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, the President, any Vice President, the Secretary or any two directors. Notice of a special meeting of the Board of Directors shall be given by the person or persons calling the meeting at least twenty-four (24) hours before the special meeting.
3.09
Special Meetings
.
     Except as otherwise provided in these By-laws, the Certificate of Incorporation or by law, the presence of a majority of the authorized number of directors shall be required to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board, and all matters shall be decided at any such meeting, a quorum being present, by the affirmative votes of a majority of the directors present. In the absence of a quorum, a majority of directors present at any meeting may adjourn the same from time to time until a quorum shall be present. Notice of any adjourned meeting need not be given. The directors shall act only as a Board, and the individual directors shall have no power as such.
3.10
Quorum and Manner of Acting

     Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board or of such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and such writing or writings or electronic transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or committee.
3.11
Action by Consent
.
     Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation or applicable law, any director may be removed at any time, either with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of the stockholders then entitled to vote at an election of directors having a majority of the voting power of this Corporation given at an annual meeting or a special meeting of the stockholders called for such purpose.
3.12
Removal of Directors
.
     The directors shall receive only such compensation for their services as directors as may be allowed by resolution of the Board. The Board may also provide that this Corporation shall reimburse each such director for any expense incurred by such director on account of his or her attendance at any meetings of the Board or committees of the Board. Neither the payment of such compensation nor the reimbursement of such expenses shall be construed to preclude any director from serving this Corporation or its subsidiaries in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.
