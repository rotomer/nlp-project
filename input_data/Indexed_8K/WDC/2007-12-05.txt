Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
At meetings with investors and analysts at an investment conference on Wednesday, December 5, 2007, Western Digital Corporation (the "Company" or "WD") executives will provide updates regarding current conditions in the hard drive industry and the Company's outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Specifically, the Company expects to communicate the following:
Item 8.01. Other Events.
On December 5, 2007, the Company will purchase all $250,000,000 in face value of the outstanding 2.125% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2014 (the "Notes"), which Notes were governed by the indenture dated as of March 28, 2007 between the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, WD Media, Inc. (formerly Komag, Incorporated) ("WD Media") and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (the "Indenture"). The Company assumed the obligations under the Indenture and the Notes in connection with its acquisition of WD Media on September 5, 2007 (the "Acquisition").
The Acquisition constituted a "Fundamental Change" under the Indenture that allowed the holders of the Notes to obligate the Company, for a limited period of time, to purchase the Notes for an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest through the purchase date. In accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Company previously sent a notice to the holders of the Notes giving them the right to require the Company to purchase the Notes on the terms set forth above on December 5, 2007 (the "Fundamental Change Purchase Date").
Holders of Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $250,000,000, constituting all of the Notes under the Indenture, tendered their Notes to the Company, and on December 5, 2007, the Company will pay approximately $251,200,000 to purchase the Notes, which aggregate amount includes all accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes through the Fundamental Change Purchase Date.
This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning demand, hard drive industry assembly capacity and inventories, expectations for December quarter revenue, earnings per share and gross margin, industry performance expectations for the March quarter, progression of the Company's integration of its media operations, and retirement of the Company's subordinated convertible debt. These forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, including relating to: supply and demand conditions in the hard drive industry; actions by competitors; unexpected advances in competing technologies such as flash memory; uncertainties related to the development and introduction of products based on new technologies and successful expansion into new hard drive markets; business conditions and growth in the desktop, mobile PC, enterprise, consumer electronics and external hard drive markets; pricing trends and fluctuations in average selling prices; the risk that the Company's business will suffer during the integration of its recently acquired media operations; failure to quickly and effectively integrate the Company's media and head technology; changes in the availability and cost of commodity materials and specialized product components that the Company does not make internally; and other risks and uncertainties listed in the Company's recent Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 6, 2007, to which your attention is directed. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
