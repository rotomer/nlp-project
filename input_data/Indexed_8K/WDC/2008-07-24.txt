LAKE FOREST, Calif.  Jul. 24, 2008  Demonstrating strong year-over-year performance, Western Digital Corp. (NYSE: WDC) today reported financial results for its fiscal year 2008 and fourth quarter ended June 27, 2008.
     The company posted revenue of $8.1 billion and operating income of $1.0 billion for fiscal year 2008. Net income was $867 million, or $3.84 per share, compared to $564 million, or $2.50 per share for the prior year. The 2008 net income amount included net charges of $75 million for taxes related to the license of intellectual property to subsidiaries and $49 million for acquired in-process research and development. The 2007 net income amount included an income tax benefit of $126 million related to adjustments to the value of the company's deferred tax assets.
     These fiscal-year results represented increases in revenue of 48 percent, compared with the prior year's $5.5 billion, and unit growth of 38 percent, from 96.5 million in 2007 to

133.3 million in 2008. The company grew its hard drive revenue contribution from non-desktop PC markets to 56 percent from 43 percent in the prior year.
     For the fourth quarter, revenue totaled $2.0 billion on shipments of approximately 35.2 million units, with operating income of $241 million and net income of $213 million, or $0.94 per share. The fourth quarter net income amount includes a $15 million incremental tax charge related to the license of intellectual property to subsidiaries.
     The June quarter results also represented strong year-over-year performance, including growth in revenue and unit shipments of 46 percent and 41 percent, respectively. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported revenue of $1.4 billion, unit shipments of 24.9 million, operating income of $79 million and net income of $212 million, or $0.94 per share. Net income in the year-ago period included a $126 million tax benefit reflecting a favorable adjustment to the valuation allowance of the company's deferred tax assets.
     Sixty-three percent of Q4 revenue was derived from non-desktop sources, while 37 percent came from hard drives configured into desktop PCs. This compares with a mix in the year-ago quarter of 46 percent non-desktop sources versus 54 percent desktop PC revenue.
     The company shipped 11.7 million 2.5-inch mobile drives and 4.1 million 3.5-inch units for the PVR/DVR market in the fourth quarter, sequential quarterly increases of 15 percent and 32 percent, respectively, and year-over-year increases of 208 percent and 52 percent, respectively. Branded product revenue of $386 million for the quarter increased 17 percent sequentially and 68 percent year-over-year. The company also continued to grow its shipments
