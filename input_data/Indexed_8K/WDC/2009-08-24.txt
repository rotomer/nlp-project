Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e) On August 20, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") established the performance goals for cash bonus awards to be made under the Western Digital Corporation Incentive Compensation Plan (the "ICP") for the six-month period beginning July 4, 2009 and ending January 1, 2010. Under the ICP, the Companys executive officers and certain other employees are eligible to receive cash bonus awards that are determined based on the Companys achievement of the established performance goals as well as other discretionary factors, including non-financial and strategic operating objectives, business and industry conditions and individual and business group performance. For the six-month period beginning July 4, 2009 and ending January 1, 2010, the Compensation Committee selected earnings per share as the financial performance goal and established specific earnings per share goals to correspond to specific achievement percentages ranging between 0% and 200%. For executive officers, the Compensation Committee has previously approved an ICP target bonus under the ICP for each executive officer that is expressed as a percentage of the executives semi-annual base salary and that currently ranges from 75% to 150% for the executive officers. At the end of the six-month performance period, the ICP will fund in an amount ranging from 0% to 200% based on an interpolation between the Companys performance as measured against the pre-established earnings per share goals and a consideration of the Companys overall achievement of key non-financial and strategic operating objectives as well as changes in the business and industry that occur during the performance period. Each executive will be eligible to receive a bonus in an amount equal to his target bonus multiplied by the funding percentage approved by the Compensation Committee, subject to further adjustment by the Compensation Committee depending upon the executive 019;s individual and business groups performance.
