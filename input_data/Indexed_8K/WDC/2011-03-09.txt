Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On March 7, 2011, Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the "Original Report"). We are filing this Report on Form 8-K/A to make a clerical correction to the description in the Original Report of the commitment letter obtained from Bank of America, N.A. to provide new credit facilities to Western Digital Technologies, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Western Digital Ireland, Ltd., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
The new senior credit facilities were described as new senior "secured" credit facilities. This description should have stated that the new senior credit facilities will be "unsecured."
The corrected 9 paragraph of Item 1.01 of the Original Report reads, in full, as set forth below:
th
"Concurrently, and in connection with entering into the Purchase Agreement, the Company, Western Digital Technologies, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("WDT"), and WDI entered into a commitment letter (the "Commitment Letter") with Bank of America, N.A. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, pursuant to which, subject to the conditions set forth therein, Bank of America, N.A. committed to provide to WDI and WDT new senior credit facilities (the "Senior Credit Facilities") up to $2,500,000,000, consisting of a $500,000,000 revolving credit facility and $2,000,000,000 in term loan facilities. The Senior Credit Facilities are contemplated to be used to finance a portion of the cash portion of the purchase price of the Transaction, to refinance WDT's existing credit facilities and to pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the Transaction and the Senior Credit Facilities. The revolving credit facility is contemplated to be used for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. The commitments of the lending parties under the Commitment Letter are subject to certain conditions, including, without limitation, the consummation of the Transaction, the absence of a material adverse event with respect to HGST, the Company or WDI and the accuracy of specified corporate representations of HGST, the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company."
