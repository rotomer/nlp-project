Item 8.01 Other Events.
On August 18, 2011, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections relating to the proposed acquisition by Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") of Viviti Technologies Ltd. ("Viviti") (formerly known as Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Holdings Pte. Ltd.), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hitachi Ltd. The Statement of Objections sets out the European Commissions preliminary assessment regarding the combination of the Company and Viviti and its potential effects on competition. A Statement of Objections is a preparatory document that does not prejudge the European Commissions final decision. The issuing of a Statement of Objections allows recipients to present arguments in response to the European Commissions preliminary assessment of the competitive effects of a notified transaction. Subject to obtaining the required regulatory approvals or expiration of applicable waiting periods in the European Union and other remaining jurisdictions, the Company expects the transaction to close during the fourth calendar quarter of this year.
