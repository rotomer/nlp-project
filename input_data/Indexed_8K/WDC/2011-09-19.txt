Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On September 14, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Board of Directors") of Western Digital Corporation (the "Company") approved new forms of award agreement under the Companys 2004 Performance Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan") applicable to "officers" of the Company within the meaning of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Companys previous forms of award agreement applicable to officers provided for accelerated vesting of the awards upon a "change in control event" of the Company within the meaning of the 2004 Plan. The new forms approved by the Compensation Committee provide, in general and in relevant part, for accelerated vesting of the awards only if there is both (1) a change in control event, and (2) the awards are to be terminated in connection with the change in control event or, within one year after the change in control event, the officers employment is terminated by the Company without "cause" or by the officer for "good reason." The foregoing summary of the new forms of award agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the new forms, which the Company anticipates filing as Exhibits to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2011. On September 15, 2011, Peter D. Behrendt advised the Board of Directors that, consistent with the Companys retirement policy for directors, he intends to retire from the Board of Directors and not seek re-election when his term expires at the Companys upcoming 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Mr. Behrendt, age 72, has served on the Companys Board of Directors since 1994.
