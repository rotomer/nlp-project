On July 25, 2012, Western Digital Corporation ("Western Digital") announced financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended June 29, 2012. A copy of the press release making this announcement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of Western Digital's Investor Information Summary for the fourth quarter ended June 29, 2012 is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
In Western Digital's press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto, Western Digital reports certain financial information, including net income and earnings per share on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis for the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended June 29, 2012. These non-GAAP measures exclude expenses related to Western Digital's acquisition of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies; costs recognized upon the sale of inventory that was written-up to fair value and amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition; expenses related to the flooding in Thailand; litigation accruals; restructuring charges; and tax effects related to the aforementioned items. Because management believes these expenses and gains may not be indicative of ongoing operations, management believes that the non-GAAP measures presented in the press release are useful to investors as an alternative method for measuring Western Digital's operating performance and comparing it against prior periods' performance.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
