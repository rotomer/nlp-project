Wisconsin Energy Reports Higher Second Quarter, Six-Month Results
MILWAUKEE -- Wisconsin Energy Corporation (NYSE:WEC) today reported second quarter net income of $49 million, or $0.42 per share, compared with net income of $45 million, or $0.39 per share, in the second quarter of 2002. In addition, the company posted substantially higher earnings for the first half of 2003.
Wisconsin Energy's positive second quarter results were driven largely by continued revenue and earnings growth in the company's pump manufacturing business, as well as improved financial performance at the company's recycling and real estate businesses. These factors offset lower earnings from WEC's utility business which was adversely impacted by unseasonably cool weather during the spring and early summer and higher fuel costs. Consolidated net income was up $4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2003.
"Our second quarter results indicate that we are managing our businesses effectively in a challenging business environment," said Richard A. Abdoo, Wisconsin Energy's chairman and chief executive officer. "We are pleased with the results we have achieved both for the quarter and for the first six months of the year, as well as with the progress we have made in executing our plan."
Power the Future
Year-to-date earnings through June 30, 2003 were $141 million, or $1.20 per share. The results compare with earnings of $41 million, or $0.35 per share for the same period a year ago. Several factors drove the improved results, including Wisconsin Energy's recognition of an asset valuation charge of $92 million after tax, or $0.79 per share, during the first quarter of 2002 that did not recur in 2003, strong manufacturing segment performance, lower interest rates and reduced debt levels.
