ITEM 5.  OTHER EVENTS AND REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.
 
As previously reported, on September 4, 2001, a lawsuit was commenced against Sta-Rite Industries, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Wisconsin Energy Corporation, in the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in Miami-Dade County, Florida. Lorenzo Peterson, a minor, was seeking damages for the personal injuries he sustained when he was trapped under water after placing his hand in the main drain on the bottom of a pool. Trial commenced on July 21, 2003 and on August 1, 2003, the jury returned a verdict against Sta-Rite in the amount of $104.4 million in compensatory damages. Counsel for the plaintiff has requested a hearing before the court on punitive damages. Sta-Rite's management, after consultation with legal counsel, believes that any claim for punitive damages is unwarranted. As such, Sta-Rite will vigorously defend the plaintiff's claim with respect to punitive damages. To date, no hearing date on this issue has be en scheduled.
Lorenzo Peterson vs. Sta-Rite:
Wisconsin Energy believes that it has adequate insurance to cover the damages. Sta-Rite intends to appeal any final judgment resulting from this case, but is currently unable to determine the impact, if any, that may result from this case.
