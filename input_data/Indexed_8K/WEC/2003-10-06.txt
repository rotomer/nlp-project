ITEM 5.  OTHER EVENTS AND REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.
   On October 3, 2003, Wisvest Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wisconsin Energy Corporation, entered into an agreement to sell its 500 megawatt Siemens Westinghouse advanced technology natural gas power island back to Siemens Westinghouse. This transaction is expected to close before November 1, 2003. Wisconsin Energy expects to receive approximately $57 million from the sale, which includes approximately $32 million in tax benefits. The Company estimates that 2004 earnings will be favorably impacted by about $0.02 per share due to the elimination of operating costs associated with this asset and reduced interest costs due to the reduction of debt from the cash generated by the sale. Wisconsin Energy anticipates that the sale will result in a third quarter 2003 non-cash charge of approximately $0.22 per share.
