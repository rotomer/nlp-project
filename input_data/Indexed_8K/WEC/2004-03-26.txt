ITEM 5.  OTHER EVENTS AND REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.
On March 25, 2004, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin ("PSCW") approved a Revised Environmental Assessment ("Revised Assessment") regarding the construction of the Port Washington power plant. The Revised Assessment concluded that a more comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement is not required. The Revised Assessment responds to the January 27, 2004 decision of the Dane County Circuit Court, which vacated and remanded to the PSCW for further consideration its decision authorizing construction of the Port Washington power plant.
In addition, the PSCW affirmed the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity ("CPCN") it originally issued in December 2002 authorizing the construction of the Port Washington power plant.
The petitioner who challenged the original CPCN has indicated in a filing with the PSCW that he intends to challenge the PSCW's order. Wisconsin Energy Corporation and Wisconsin Electric Power Company are unable to determine the impact, if any, that this challenge may have on this matter.
