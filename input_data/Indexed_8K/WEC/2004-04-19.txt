ITEM 5.  OTHER EVENTS AND REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.
On April 16, 2004, the Dane County Circuit Court dismissed one of two appeals of the Revised Environmental Assessment by the Public Service Commission regarding the construction of the Port Washington power plant. This Revised Assessment concluded that a more comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement was not required. The Court also rejected the petitioner's motion to enforce its January 27, 2004 order. The appeals were filed by the same petitioner who challenged the original Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the Port Washington power plant. The second appeal is pending before a separate Dane County Circuit Court Judge. Wisconsin Energy Corporation and Wisconsin Electric Power Company are currently unable to determine the outcome of this second appeal.
