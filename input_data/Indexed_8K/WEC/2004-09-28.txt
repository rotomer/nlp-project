ITEM 2.05  COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES.
On September 28, 2004, Wisconsin Energy Corporation (Wisconsin Energy) announced to its employees an enhanced severance package for selected non-officer management employees of Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric Power Company and Wisconsin Gas LLC who elect to voluntarily resign. The enhanced severance package is being offered to help reduce the upward pressure on operating expenses. Eligible employees will have from October 4, 2004 through November 12, 2004 to apply to participate in this plan. The Company expects that at least 120 employees will volunteer for the program. The pre-tax costs associated with the program are not expected to exceed $25 million. The actual cost of the program will be finalized and expensed in the fourth quarter of 2004 when the actual number of employees will be known.
