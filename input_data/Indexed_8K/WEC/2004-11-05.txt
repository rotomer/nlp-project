ITEM 2.03 CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT.
On November 1, 2004, Wisconsin Electric Power Company entered into a new $125 million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, as agent for the lenders, that expires in November 2007. This new facility replaces Wisconsin Electric's $100 million 11-month letter agreement.
This facility is intended for commercial paper liquidity purposes and is currently expected to be undrawn.
The interest rate and facility fee on the new facility vary based on Wisconsin Electric's public debt ratings. The current interest rate is LIBOR plus .50% and the facility fee is .10%. Should more than 33% of the commitments be utilized, the interest rate will increase to LIBOR plus .625%.
The new facility contains customary covenants, including certain limitations on Wisconsin Electric's ability to sell assets and a requirement that Wisconsin Electric, subject to certain exceptions, maintain a total funded debt to capitalization ratio of no more than .65 to 1.0. The new facility also contains customary events of default, including payment defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy proceedings, certain judgments, ERISA defaults and change of control.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each of the registrants has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
