ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.
On November 23, 2004, we received notice that we were granted a "Chapter 30 Permit" authorizing construction of new coal-fired generating units at our Elm Road facility in Oak Creek, Wisconsin (the "new units"), consistent with the terms and conditions proposed by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources ("WDNR") in its draft Chapter 30 Permit. We had applied to the WDNR for a permit for wetlands and waterways alterations and construction on the bed of Lake Michigan for the construction of the new units.
The permit decision was made by an Administrative Law Judge after a contested case hearing. As expected, we must obtain certain additional state and federal environmental permits before we can complete all phases of construction of the new units; however, the approval of the Chapter 30 permit is a critical step forward.
Under Wisconsin law, the parties that petitioned the WDNR for the contested case hearing may seek further review of the decision.
