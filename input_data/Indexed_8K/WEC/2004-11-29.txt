ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.
On November 29, 2004, the Dane County Circuit Court reviewing the challenges to the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin ("PSCW") order authorizing us to build two coal-fired generating facilities on the site of our existing Oak Creek Power Plant (the "new units") vacated the order and remanded it back to the PSCW for additional proceedings. The Court determined that the PSCW committed errors in determining the completeness of our application and in its decisions on several other points.
We are reviewing our legal and regulatory options to determine the best course of action to keep this project on schedule.
Without additional information, we are unable to determine the ultimate impact, if any, that may result from the Court's decision.
