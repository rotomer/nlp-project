ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.
Wisconsin Electric Power Company ("Wisconsin Electric"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Wisconsin Energy Corporation, operates under a fuel cost adjustment clause for fuel and purchased power costs associated with the generation and delivery of electricity to its retail customers in Wisconsin. In January 2005, Wisconsin Electric completed a power supply cost analysis which included updated natural gas cost projections for 2005. Based upon this analysis, Wisconsin Electric determined that projected costs had deviated outside of a range prescribed by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin ("PSCW") when compared to fuel and purchased power costs authorized in current rates. As a result, on February 7, 2005 Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to increase Wisconsin retail electric rates by approximately $114 million annually to recover the forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in anticipated costs is being driven primarily by the increas ed reliance on gas-fueled generation and purchased power. This increased reliance on gas-fueled generation and purchased power is driven by (i) the need to replace generation from base load facilities during scheduled maintenance outages in 2005, including outages on both units at the Point Beach Nuclear Plant which occur every 18 months, (ii) the retirement of the coal-fueled units in Port Washington in 2004 and (iii) the need to meet the growing energy needs of its customers. The increased fuel revenues are expected to be effective in early March 2005. The revenues that we receive under the filing are subject to refund and our filing will be audited by the PSCW.
