Wisconsin Energy Corporation posts higher
2004 year-end results
MILWAUKEE -- Wisconsin Energy (NYSE: WEC) today reported 2004 net income of $306 million or $2.57 per share. This compares with earnings of $244 million or $2.06 per share in 2003.
In 2004, the company recorded a gain of $1.28 per share on the sale of its pump and water systems business offset somewhat by non-cash charges of 81 cents per share associated with the company's Calumet and Minergy Neenah facilities, debt redemption costs of 13 cents per share and severance costs of 16 cents per share. In 2003, our earnings were reduced by valuation charges of 32 cents per share offset by a gain of 7 cents per share on the sale of nonutility investments.
Excluding the effect of asset sales, impairment charges and other one-time items, adjusted earnings for 2004 were $285 million or $2.39 per share, compared with $274 million or $2.31 per share, on the same basis in 2003.
Wisconsin Energy also reported fourth quarter 2004 earnings of $93 million or $0.79 per share, compared with $72 million or $0.60 per share for the final quarter of 2003.
Results were higher in the fourth quarter of 2004 because of customer growth, slightly colder weather and the absence of a nuclear refueling outage.
Fourth quarter revenues were $952 million in 2004, compared with $852 million in the same period a year earlier. Annual revenues were $3.43 billion in 2004, compared with $3.31 billion in 2003.
Electricity sales were up approximately 1.5 percent in 2004, despite one of the coolest summers on record. Use of electricity by large commercial and industrial customers grew by 2.5 percent. Wisconsin Energy customers also set a new winter peak demand record on December 22, 2004.
"I am very pleased with our progress in 2004," said Gale Klappa, Wisconsin Energy's chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We successfully sold non-core assets, strengthened our balance sheet and improved our operating and financial performance. We also made significant progress on our Power the Future plan. Construction of the first of two 545 megawatt generating units at our Port Washington site was more than 75 percent complete at year-end."
Earnings per share listed in this news release are on a fully diluted basis.

Non-GAAP Earnings Measures
Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP earnings), which generally exclude non-operational items as well as one-time charges or credits that are not associated with the company's ongoing operations, are provided as a complement to earnings presented in accordance with GAAP. These items are not indicative of the company's operating performance. Therefore, we believe that the presentation of earnings from adjusted operations is relevant and useful to investors to understand Wisconsin Energy's operating performance. Management uses such measures internally to evaluate the company's performance and manage its operations.
