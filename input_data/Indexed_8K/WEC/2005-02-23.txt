As expected, on February 21, 2005, S.C. Johnson and Son, Inc. and Clean Wisconsin, Inc. filed a petition for judicial review in Dane County Circuit Court of a decision by the Administrative Law Judge on February 3, 2005, affirming the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources' ("WDNR") issuance of an Air Pollution Control and Construction Permit (the "Permit") for the proposed coal-fired generating units at the Elm Road Generating Station. The Administrative Law Judge affirmed the issuance of the Permit after a contested case hearing. The WDNR issued the Permit to Wisconsin Electric Power Company on January 14, 2004.
