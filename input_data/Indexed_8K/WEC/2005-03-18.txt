ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.
On March 17, 2005, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin ("PSCW") approved Wisconsin Electric Power Company's ("Wisconsin Electric") request to increase its Wisconsin retail electric prices on an interim basis by approximately $115 million annually to recover the increases in its fuel and purchased power costs. The rise in costs is attributable primarily to increased reliance on natural gas-fueled generation and purchased power. The additional natural gas-fueled generation and purchased power is needed to (i) replace generation from base load facilities during scheduled maintenance outages in 2005, including outages on both units at the Point Beach Nuclear Plant which occur every 18 months, (ii) address the retirement of the coal-fueled units in Port Washington in 2004 and (iii) meet the growing energy needs of Wisconsin Electric's customers. This increase will be effective on March 18, 2005, and will be subject to refund following PSCW audit, hearings and final order.
