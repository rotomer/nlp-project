ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.
On March 30, 2005, we received notice that we were granted a Wisconsin Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit ("WPDES Permit") authorizing construction and operation of the cooling water intake and wastewater discharge system for the combined Oak Creek Power Plant and new Elm Road Generating Station by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources ("WDNR"). The permit is effective March 30, 2005. We have now received every state permit necessary to begin construction of the new Elm Road Generating Station.
Under Wisconsin law, any party may seek administrative or judicial review of the WDNR's decision to issue the WPDES permit. In addition, we must obtain an additional federal permit and we must successfully resolve the judicial challenges to the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity issued by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, as well as defending challenges to the permits previously issued.
