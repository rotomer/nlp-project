Wisconsin Energy Corporation Posts Higher Results From Continuing Operations MILWAUKEE -
Wisconsin Energy (NYSE:WEC) today reported net income from continuing operations of $90 million or 76 cents per share for the first quarter of 2005. This compares with earnings of $84 million or 69 cents per share from continuing operations in the same period of 2004. In last year's first quarter, the company recorded a charge of 3 cents per share for costs related to early redemption of trust preferred securities. Excluding the effect of this item, adjusted earnings in the first quarter of 2004 were 72 cents per share. Results in the first quarter of 2005 were driven in part by a significant decrease in debt levels at Wisconsin Energy and continued cost control throughout its utility operations. These positive factors were partially offset by sharply higher fuel costs and by greater reliance on natural gas as a fuel to produce electricity. First quarter 2005 revenues were $1.1 billion compared with $1.07 billion in the first quarter last year. Residential use of electricity was down 2.5 percent in this year's first quarter, reflecting milder winter temperatures as compared to last year.  Use of electricity by commercial and industrial customers declined 0.5 percent -- in part because there was one less day in the first quarter of 2005 than in the first quarter of 2004.
"Overall, we delivered strong, positive results as we continued to focus on operating efficiency and customer satisfaction in our core business," said Gale Klappa, Wisconsin Energy's chairman, president and chief executive officer. Earnings per share listed in this news release are on a fully diluted basis.
A conference call is scheduled for 1 p.m. Central time on Thursday, April 28, 2005. The presentation will review 2005 first quarter earnings and discuss the company's outlook for the future.

Non-GAAP Earnings Measures
Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP earnings), which generally exclude non-operational items as well as one-time charges or credits that are not associated with the company's ongoing operations, are provided as a complement to earnings presented in accordance with GAAP. The excluded items are not indicative of the company's operating performance. Therefore, we believe that the presentation of adjusted earnings from operations is relevant and useful to investors to understand Wisconsin Energy's operating performance.  Management uses such measures internally to evaluate the company's performance and manage its operations.
