ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.
On September 16, 2005, the Dane County Circuit Court dismissed with prejudice the appeal of an administrative law judge's decision affirming the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources' issuance of the Air Pollution Control and Construction Permit ("Air Permit") to Wisconsin Electric Power Company for the Oak Creek expansion. All parties to this action agreed to the dismissal. This dismissal is the final resolution of all legal challenges to the Air Permit.
Certain other permits necessary for construction of the Oak Creek expansion continue to be contested, but remain in effect unless and until overturned by an administrative law judge or a reviewing court.
