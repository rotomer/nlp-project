ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
On December 12, 2005, pursuant to the terms of the Short-Term Performance Plan of Wisconsin Energy Corporation effective January 1, 1992, as amended and restated as of August 15, 2000 (the "STPP"), the Compensation Committee of Wisconsin Energy Corporation's Board of Directors established the performance goals for the upcoming 2006 plan year. In general, the 2006 annual incentive under the STPP will be dependent upon financial achievement determined by Wisconsin Energy's performance against targets for earnings from ongoing operations and cash flows, which will be established in the near future. In addition to Wisconsin Energy's targets for earnings from ongoing operations and cash flows, officers and employees whose positions principally relate to utility operations are also measured against targets for the aggregate net income of Wisconsin Electric Power Company and Wisconsin Gas LLC. Awards can be increased or decreased by up to 10% based upon Wisconsin Energy's performance in the operational areas of customer satisfaction (5%), supplier and workforce diversity (2.5%) and safety (2.5%).
