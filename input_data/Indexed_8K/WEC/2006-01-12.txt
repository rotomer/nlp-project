ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.
On January 11, 2006, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin ("PSCW") reviewed Wisconsin Electric Power Company's ("Wisconsin Electric") and Wisconsin Gas LLC's ("Wisconsin Gas") requests to increase electric and natural gas rates. In a release by the PSCW dated January 11, 2006, the PSCW reported that it had approved increases of (i) $226 million (10.8%) in electric rates for Wisconsin Electric, (ii) $41 million (4.0%) for natural gas service from Wisconsin Gas, and (iii) $21 million (2.8%) for natural gas service from Wisconsin Electric.
In addition, in the same release the PSCW reported that it took the following actions:
Set a return on equity for Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas of 11.2%.
Approved two renewable energy pilot programs, one for electricity generated from bio-mass and one for electricity generated from wind.
Approved a plan for Wisconsin Electric to immediately refund any over-collection of fuel costs in its electric rates to ratepayers. Currently, refunds are made only after fuel costs fall outside a pre-established range and a fuel rate case is conducted by the PSCW.
The PSCW announced that these rate increases will be finalized in a written PSCW Order, and that they will become effective after the written Order is issued.
