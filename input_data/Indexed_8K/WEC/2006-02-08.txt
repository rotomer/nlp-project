Wisconsin Energy posts fourth quarter and full-year results for 2005
MILWAUKEE -- Wisconsin Energy (NYSE: WEC) today reported earnings from continuing operations of $91 million or 77 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2005. This compares with earnings from continuing operations of $85 million or 71 cents per share for the final quarter of 2004.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the company recorded a 7 cent per share charge associated with employee severance costs. Excluding the effect of this item, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2004 were 78 cents per share.
Results in the fourth quarter of 2005 were reduced by the cost of a nuclear refueling outage which did not occur in the final quarter of 2004.
Fourth quarter revenues were $1.1 billion in 2005, compared with $946 million in the same period a year earlier. Annual revenues were $3.8 billion in 2005, compared with $3.4 billion in 2004.
Retail electricity sales grew by approximately 3 percent in 2005, driven in part by warm summer weather. Use of electricity by residential customers was up by 6.3 percent in 2005.
For the full year 2005, Wisconsin Energy's earnings from continuing operations totaled $304 million or $2.56 per share. In 2004, comparable results were $220 million or $1.84 per share.
In 2005, the company recorded a gain of 14 cents per share from the reversal of state tax operating losses. In 2004, the company recorded debt redemption costs of 13 cents per share and severance costs of 16 cents per share.
Excluding the effects of these items, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $2.42 per share in 2005 as compared to $2.13 per share on the same basis in 2004. Key factors driving the increase in adjusted earnings from continuing operations in 2005 included favorable weather and six months of earnings contribution from the company's new gas-fired generating facility at Port Washington. These were partially offset by higher fuel costs at Wisconsin Electric and increased operation and maintenance expenses at the company's Point Beach Nuclear Plant.
"I'm very pleased with our overall performance in 2005," said Gale Klappa, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Despite unprecedented volatility in the fuel markets, we delivered higher customer satisfaction and solid financial results. We also made significant progress on our Power the Future plan, bringing our first natural gas unit at Port Washington on line in July and starting construction on two major new coal units at our site in Oak Creek. We were also rated as one of the ten best managed utilities in America by Forbes magazine.
"During 2005, we invested nearly $750 million to improve the energy infrastructure in Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. And over the next three years, we expect to invest another $3 billion to maintain reliability and improve fuel diversity for our customers," said Klappa.
Earnings per share listed in this news release are on a fully diluted basis.

Non-GAAP Earnings Measures
Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP earnings), which generally exclude non-operational items as well as one-time charges or credits that are not associated with the company's ongoing operations, are provided as a complement to earnings presented in accordance with GAAP. The excluded items are not indicative of the company's operating performance. Therefore, we believe that the presentation of adjusted earnings from continuing operations is relevant and useful to investors to understand Wisconsin Energy's operating performance.
