Wisconsin Energy Corporation posts higher results from continuing operations
MILWAUKEE -Wisconsin Energy (NYSE:WEC) today reported net income from continuing operations of $105 million or 88 cents per share for the first quarter of 2006. This compares with earnings of $90 million or 76 cents per share from continuing operations in the same period last year. Results in the first quarter of 2006 were driven by improved recovery of fuel costs as well as the earnings contribution from Wisconsin Energy's new natural gas-fired generating plant at Port Washington. These positive factors were partially offset by the effects of unusually mild winter weather.
Temperature records indicate that January 2006 was the warmest January since 1891. And this year's first quarter was the fifth warmest in the past 116 years.
Residential use of electricity was down 0.1 percent in this year's first quarter. Consumption of electricity by large commercial and industrial customers was down 0.4 percent compared to last year, while usage by small commercial and industrial customers was up 0.3 percent.
First quarter 2006 revenues were $1.25 billion compared with $1.10 billion in the first quarter last year. At the end of March, the company was serving 11,247 more electric customers and 14,345 more gas customers than a year ago.
"Overall, we delivered strong, positive results as we continued to focus on operating efficiency, cost discipline and customer satisfaction across our core business," said Gale Klappa, Wisconsin Energy's chairman, president and chief executive officer. Earnings per share listed in this news release are on a fully diluted basis.
