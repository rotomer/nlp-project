Wisconsin Energy Corporation posts higher results in second quarter
MILWAUKEE - Wisconsin Energy (NYSE:WEC) reported net income from continuing operations of $59.7 million or 50 cents per share for the second quarter of 2006. This compares with net income from continuing operations of $56.8 million or 48 cents per share in the second quarter of 2005. In this year's second quarter, the company recognized a one cent per share gain from the sale of its one-third interest in the Guardian Pipeline. In the second quarter last year, the company recorded a one-time gain of 14 cents per share because it was able to recognize state tax operating losses at the parent company level. Continued cost control across the utility operations, the absence of a refueling outage at either of the company's nuclear units, and improved margins in the natural gas business more than offset the impact of milder weather in the second quarter.
Residential use of electricity was down 9.4 percent in this year's second quarter due to the milder weather. Consumption of electricity by large commercial and industrial customers was down 4.5 percent, while use of electricity by small commercial and industrial customers was basically flat relative to last year's levels. At the end of June, the company was serving 11,236 more electric customers and 13,466 more natural gas customers than a year ago.
Second quarter 2006 revenues from continuing operations were $814.4 million compared with $788.5 million in the second quarter last year. "We posted solid financial results in the first half of this year," said Gale Klappa, Wisconsin Energy's chairman, president and chief executive officer. "And our focus remains on generating high levels of customer satisfaction and world-class reliability at competitive prices."
Klappa noted that Wisconsin Energy customers set all-time records for electricity demand twice in July -- first on July 17 and again on July 31.
On July 17, demand reached 6,393 megawatts even though the company's largest industrial customer had significantly lower energy use that day because of scheduled maintenance at their facilities. On July 31, the company set a new all-time record of approximately 6,500 megawatts as a summer heat wave blanketed the region.
Earnings per share listed in this news release are on a fully diluted basis.
