Wisconsin Energy posts fourth quarter and full-year results for 2006
MILWAUKEE -- Wisconsin Energy (NYSE: WEC) today reported earnings from continuing operations of $78 million or 65 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2006. This compares with earnings from continuing operations of $91 million or 77 cents per share for the final quarter of 2005.
In the fourth quarter, the company recorded a 5 cent per share gain associated with the ability to recognize state tax operating losses at the parent company level. Excluding the effect of this item, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2006 were 60 cents per share.
Fourth quarter revenues were $1.1 billion in 2006, compared with $1.1 billion in the same period a year earlier. Annual revenues were $4.0 billion in 2006, compared with $3.8 billion in 2005.
Retail electricity sales declined by approximately 2.7 percent in 2006. Use of electricity by residential customers declined by 2.8 percent in 2006. The decline in electricity sales was primarily due to unusually mild winter weather and a reduction in sales to large industrial customers.
For the full year 2006, Wisconsin Energy's earnings from continuing operations totaled $312 million or $2.64 per share. In 2005, comparable results were $304 million or $2.56 per share.
In 2006, the company recorded a gain of 5 cents per share from the reversal of state tax operating losses, as well as a 1 cent per share gain on the sale of its interest in the Guardian Pipeline. In 2005, the company also recorded a gain of 14 cents per share from the reversal of state tax operating losses.
Excluding the effects of these items, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $2.58 per share in 2006 as compared with $2.42 per share on the same basis in 2005. Key factors driving the increase in adjusted earnings from continuing operations in 2006 included a full year of operation of the new Port Washington Generating Station, improved natural gas margins, and the elimination of under-recovered fuel costs.
"I'm very pleased with our overall performance in 2006," said Gale Klappa, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We delivered a higher level of customer satisfaction. And we posted solid earnings despite less than favorable weather. In addition, we resolved the uncertainties surrounding the future of the Point Beach nuclear plant with our agreement to sell this facility and purchase the output of the units going forward.
"During 2006, we invested nearly $930 million to improve the energy infrastructure in Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. And over the next three years, we expect to invest another $3 billion to maintain reliability and improve fuel diversity for our customers," said Klappa. These future investments include the company's Blue Sky Green Field wind project that was approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin on Jan. 25, 2007.
Earnings per share listed in this news release are on a fully diluted basis.
