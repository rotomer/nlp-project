Wisconsin Energy Corporation posts first quarter earnings from continuing operations
MILWAUKEE -Wisconsin Energy (NYSE:WEC) today reported net income from continuing operations of $101 million or 85 cents per share for the first quarter of 2007. This compares with earnings of $104 million or 88 cents per share from continuing operations in the corresponding period last year. Results in the first quarter of 2007 were helped by stronger gas margins that reflected a return to normal winter weather. However, this improvement was offset by under recovery of electric fuel and purchased power costs.
Total retail sales of electricity increased by 1.4 percent. Consumption of electricity by residential customers rose by 4.3 percent -- driven by customer growth and a return to normal winter weather. Electricity use by large commercial and industrial customers was down by 2.6 percent compared to last year's first quarter, while usage by small commercial and industrial customers was up by 3.8 percent.
First quarter 2007 revenues were $1.30 billion compared with $1.25 billion in the first quarter last year. At the end of March, the company was serving 8,800 more electric customers and 10,800 more gas customers than a year ago.
"Overall, we're pleased with our first quarter results," said Gale Klappa, Wisconsin Energy's chairman, president and chief executive officer. "The timing of planned maintenance at our power plants is more weighted to the first half of the year as compared to the schedule for 2006. As a result, we anticipated the additional fuel and purchased power costs that were associated with these planned outages. And we expect all of our major units to be ready for the summer run," he added. Earnings per share listed in this news release are on a fully diluted basis.
A conference call is scheduled for 1 p.m. Central time on Tuesday, May 1, 2007. The presentation will review 2007 first quarter earnings and discuss the company's outlook for the future.
