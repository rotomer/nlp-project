     (ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
 
     (iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto; and , further, that the indemnity agreement in this paragraph (a) with respect to the Preliminary Prospectus and other information included in the Disclosure Package shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or other liabilities purchased Securities, or any person controlling such Underwriter, to the extent that (i) prior to the Execution Time the Company shall have notified such Underwriter that the Preliminary Prospectus or other information included in the Disclosure Package contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein in order to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) such untrue statement or omission of a material fact was corrected in an amended or supplemented Preliminary Prospectus or, where permitted by law, an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and such corrected Preliminary Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus was provided to such Underwriter and filed with the Commission far enough in advance of the Execution Time so that such corrected Preliminary Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus could have been conveyed to such person prior to the Execution Time, (iii) such corrected Preliminary Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (excluding any document then incorporated or deemed incorporated therein by reference) was not conveyed to such person at or prior to the Execution Time, and (iv) such loss, claim, damage or liability would not have occurred had the corrected Preliminary Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (excluding any document then incorporated or deemed incorporated therein by reference) been conveyed to such person prior to the Execution Time.

provided
provided
          (b) . Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, or any Preliminary Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment

          (c) . Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing within a reasonable period of time of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 6. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; , however, that if the defendants (including impleaded parties) in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 6 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to local counsel) representing the indemnified parties), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party.
Actions Against Parties; Notification
provided
          (d) . If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement Without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
          SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims,
CONTRIBUTION
 
damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
          The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover.
          The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by an Underwriter in writing through the Representatives and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
          The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
          Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
          No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
          For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the
 
same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in hereto and not joint.
Schedule A
          SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of the Securities to the Underwriters.
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS TO SURVIVE DELIVERY
          SECTION 9. .
TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT
          (a) . The Representatives may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to Closing Time (i) if there has been any Material Adverse Change, or (ii) if there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or the international financial markets, any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis (including any terrorist activity), the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (iii) if trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or if trading generally on the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange or in the Nasdaq National Market has been suspended or materially limited (other than to provide for an orderly market), or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by any of said exchanges or by such system or by order of the Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or any other governmental authority, or (iv) if a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services shall have occurred.
Termination; General
          (b) . If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and; provided further that Sections 6 and 7 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.
Liabilities
          SECTION 10. . If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at Closing Time to purchase the Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the ""), the Representatives shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters reasonably acceptable to the Company, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such principal amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representatives shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:
DEFAULT BY ONE OR MORE OF THE UNDERWRITERS
Defaulted Securities
 
          (a) if the aggregate principal amount of the Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, each of the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportion that its respective underwriting obligation hereunder bears to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
          (b) if the aggregate principal amount of the Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
          No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
          In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement either (i) the Representatives or (ii) the Company shall have the right to postpone Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 10.
          SECTION 11. . All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication.

          (v) The Company is not an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company," as such terms are defined in the 1940 Act.
          (vi) The statements in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption "Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations", to the extent they constitute matters of United States federal income tax law or legal conclusions with respect thereto, are correct in all material respects.
 
          We have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of and counsel to the Underwriters and representatives of the independent public accountants for the Company at which conferences the contents of the Prospectus, the Registration Statement and the Disclosure Package and related matters were discussed. Given the limitations inherent in the role of outside counsel and the character of determinations involved in the preparation of such documents, we are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, Disclosure Package or the Prospectus and have made no independent check or verification thereof (except as indicated in paragraphs (i) and (vi) above). On the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to our attention that lead us to believe that the Registration Statement, as of the date of the Underwriting Agreement, or any subsequent amendment thereto, at the time such amendment became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Prospectus contained, as of its date, or contains, as of the date hereof, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted, as of its date, or omits, as of the date hereof, to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that the Disclosure Package, taken together as a whole, as of the Execution Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (it being understood that we have not been asked to comment and express no opinion or belief with respect to the Form T-1 or the financial statements, including the notes thereto, or any other financial or statistical set forth or referred to in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package).
          In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company, representatives of the Trustee and public officials. In giving such opinion such counsel may rely, as to all matters governed by the laws of jurisdictions other than the law of the State of New York and the federal law of the United States, upon the opinions of counsel satisfactory to the Representatives. Such opinion shall not state that it is to be governed or qualified by, or that it is otherwise subject to, any treatise, written policy or other document relating to legal opinions, including, without limitation, the Legal Opinion Accord of the ABA Section of Business Law (1991).
          For purposes of such opinion, "Exchange Act Documents" shall mean the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, and the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on March 8, 2007.

          (vii) To the best of my knowledge, there are no statutes or regulations that are required to be described in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus that are not described as required.

          (xi) The execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities and the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Underwriting Agreement and in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (including the issuance and sale of the Securities and the use of the proceeds from the sale of the Securities as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds") and compliance by the Company with its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities do not and will not, whether with or without the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, conflict with or constitute a breach of or default or similar event under or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to any written contract, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan or credit agreement, note, lease or any
 
other agreement or instrument, known to me, to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by which it or any of them may be bound, or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary is subject (except for such conflicts, breaches, similar events or defaults or liens, charges or encumbrances that would not have a Material Adverse Effect), nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the charter or by-laws of the Company, or any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree, known to me, of any government, government instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties, assets or operations.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as counsel to Wisconsin Energy Corporation, a Wisconsin corporation (the "Corporation"), in connection with the preparation and filing by the Corporation of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Reg. No. 333-142664), as amended (the "Registration Statement"), including the base Prospectus dated May 7, 2007 included in the Registration Statement (the "Prospectus"), the preliminary Prospectus Supplement dated May 8, 2007, and the final Prospectus Supplement dated May 8, 2007 (the preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the final Prospectus Supplement, collectively, the "Prospectus Supplement"), each as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). The Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement describe the Corporation's offer to sell the Corporation's 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes due 2067 (the "Notes"). This opinion relates to the discussion set forth under the caption "MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS" of the Prospectus Supplement. All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Prospectus Supplement.
     In connection with the preparation of our opinion, we have examined such documents and other materials as we have deemed appropriate, including, but not limited to, the Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement. We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such corporate records, certificates and other documents and have made such investigations of law as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion expressed below. In our examination of documents, we have assumed, with your consent, that all documents submitted to us as copies faithfully reproduce the original thereof, that such originals are authentic, that all such documents were duly executed to the extent required and that all obligations imposed by any such documents on the parties thereto were performed or satisfied in accordance with their terms. In addition, we have obtained such information and representations as we have deemed relevant and necessary through consultation with officers of the Corporation, and we have obtained a written certificate (the "Certificate") from officers of the Corporation verifying certain relevant facts that have been

represented to us.
     Our opinion assumes (i) the accuracy and completeness of the facts contained in the Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement and other materials examined by us, (ii) the consummation of the offer to sell the Notes in the manner contemplated by, and in accordance with the terms set forth in, the Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement, and (iii) any information or representation provided by officers of the Corporation or provided in the Certificate were true, correct and complete and remained true, correct and complete at all times leading up to the sale of the Notes. We have not, however, undertaken any independent investigation of any factual matter set forth in any of the foregoing.
     Based upon and subject to the foregoing, the discussion contained in the Prospectus Supplement under the caption "MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS," subject to the limitations described therein, constitutes the opinion of Troutman Sanders LLP. There can be no assurance that changes in the law will not take place that could affect such United States federal income tax consequences or that contrary positions may not be taken by the Internal Revenue Service. In the event any of the facts, statements, descriptions, covenants, representations, warranties or assumptions upon which we have relied is incorrect, our opinion might be adversely affected and may not be relied upon.
     Our opinion expresses our view only as to United States federal income tax laws in effect as of the date hereof. The authorities upon which our opinion relies are subject to change with potential retroactive effect. Nevertheless, by rendering this opinion we undertake no responsibility to advise you of any change in United States federal income tax laws or the application or interpretation thereof that could affect our opinion.
     We hereby consent to the filing of this letter as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the reference to us in the Registration Statement under the caption "Legal Matters" and in the Prospectus Supplement under the heading "MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS." By giving such consent, we do not admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
