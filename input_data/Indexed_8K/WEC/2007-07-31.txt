Wisconsin Energy Corporation posts second quarter earnings
MILWAUKEE -Wisconsin Energy (NYSE:WEC) today reported net income from continuing operations of $57.7 million or 49 cents per share for the second quarter of 2007. This compares with net income from continuing operations of $59.7 million or 50 cents per share in the second quarter of 2006. Results in this year's second quarter were helped by a return to more normal weather and the settlement of a billing dispute with the company's largest customer. However, these factors were offset by unfavorable recoveries of electric fuel and purchased power costs and expenses associated with a planned refueling outage at the company's Point Beach Nuclear Plant.
Residential use of electricity was up 6.2 percent in this year's second quarter - driven by customer growth and seasonal weather. Consumption of electricity by large commercial and industrial customers was up 0.9 percent, while use of electricity by small commercial and industrial customers rose by 3.5 percent.
At the end of June, the company was serving 7,148 more electric customers and 9,181 more natural gas customers than a year ago.
Second quarter 2007 revenues from continuing operations were $907 million compared with $814 million in the second quarter last year.
"We're pleased with our financial results in the first half of this year," said Gale Klappa, Wisconsin Energy's chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Our focus remains on delivering high levels of customer satisfaction and world-class reliability at competitive prices."
Earnings per share listed in this news release are on a fully diluted basis.
