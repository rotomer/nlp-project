Wisconsin Energy Corporation posts higher third quarter results
MILWAUKEE - Wisconsin Energy (NYSE:WEC) today reported net income from continuing operations of $83 million or 70 cents per share for the third quarter of 2007. This compares with net income from continuing operations of $71 million or 60 cents per share for the third quarter of 2006.
Electric sales were up slightly -- driven in part by customer growth. The company also benefited from effective cost controls and favorable recovery of fuel costs.

Consumption of electricity by small commercial and industrial customers was up 1.6 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2007.
