Wisconsin Energy Corporation posts fourth quarter and full-year results for 2007
MILWAUKEE - Wisconsin Energy (NYSE: WEC) today reported earnings from continuing operations of $95 million or 80 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2007. This compares with earnings from continuing operations of $78 million or 65 cents per share for the final quarter of 2006.
In the fourth quarter of 2006, the company recorded a 5 cent per share gain associated with the ability to recognize state tax operating losses at the parent company level. Excluding the effect of this item, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2006 were 60 cents per share.
Fourth quarter revenues were $1.15 billion in 2007, compared with $1.10 billion in the same period a year earlier. For the full year 2007, revenues were $4.24 billion, compared with $4.00 billion in 2006.
Retail electricity sales in 2007 increased by approximately 2.2 percent over the previous year. Use of electricity by residential customers grew by 3.2 percent in 2007.
Wisconsin Energy's 2007 earnings from continuing operations totaled $336 million or $2.84 per share. In 2006, earnings from continuing operations were $312 million or $2.64 per share.
In 2006, the company recorded a gain of 5 cents per share from the reversal of state tax operating losses, as well as a 1 cent per share gain on the sale of its interest in the Guardian Pipeline.
Excluding the effects of these items, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $2.84 per share in 2007 as compared with $2.58 per share on the same basis in 2006. Key factors driving the increase in adjusted earnings from continuing operations in 2007 included favorable weather, improved natural gas margins and lower operating costs.
"I'm very pleased with our overall performance in 2007," said Gale Klappa, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We invested nearly $1.2 billion in 2007 to improve the energy infrastructure in Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. And over the next three years, we expect to invest another $2.8 billion to maintain reliability and improve fuel diversity for our customers," said Klappa.
Earnings per share listed in this news release are on a fully diluted basis.
