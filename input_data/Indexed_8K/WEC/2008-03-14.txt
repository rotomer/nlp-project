ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.
 
Wisconsin Electric Power Company ("Wisconsin Electric"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Wisconsin Energy Corporation, operates under a fuel cost adjustment clause for fuel and purchased power costs associated with the generation and delivery of electricity to its retail customers in Wisconsin. For the months of January and February, 2008, Wisconsin Electric's actual fuel costs exceeded a range prescribed by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin ("PSCW"). In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric completed a power supply cost analysis which included updated natural gas cost projections for 2008. Based upon this analysis, Wisconsin Electric determined that projected costs will also deviate outside of the range when compared to fuel and purchased power costs authorized in current rates. As a result, on March 13, 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to increase Wisconsin retail electric rates by approximately $79.1 million (3.4 percent) to recover the forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel costs is being driven primarily by (i) the recent increases in the price of natural gas and (ii) the higher cost of transporting coal by rail. The increased fuel revenues are expected to be effective in early April 2008. The revenues that we receive under the filing are subject to refund and our filing will be audited by the PSCW.
