ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.
 
On April 11, 2008, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin ("PSCW") approved Wisconsin Electric Power Company's request to increase Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. The PSCW approved a $76.9 million (3.3%) increase on an annual basis to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel costs is being driven primarily by (i) increases in the price of natural gas and (ii) the higher cost of transporting coal by rail. The increased rates were effective April 15, 2008. The revenues that we collect are subject to refund with interest at a rate of 10.75%, pending PSCW review and final approval.
