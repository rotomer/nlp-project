Wisconsin Energy posts first quarter earnings
MILWAUKEE -Wisconsin Energy (NYSE: WEC) today reported net income from continuing operations of $123 million or $1.04 per share for the first quarter of 2008. This compares with earnings of $101 million or 85 cents per share from continuing operations in last year's first quarter.
"A cold, snowy winter drove electric and natural gas usage higher across Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Our electric sales were the highest for any winter quarter in our history and our natural gas sales were the second highest for any quarter in our history," said Gale Klappa, Wisconsin Energy's chairman, president and chief executive officer.
Total retail sales of electricity increased by 2.0 percent over the first quarter of 2007. Consumption of electricity by residential customers rose by 2.8 percent - driven by the extended cold weather and customer growth. Electricity use by large commercial and industrial customers was up by 2.1 percent compared with last year's first quarter, while usage by small commercial and industrial customers grew by 1.3 percent.
First quarter 2008 revenues were $1.43 billion compared with $1.30 billion in the first quarter last year. At the end of March, the company was serving 7,200 more electric customers and 7,900 more natural gas customers than a year ago.
"We're pleased with our first quarter results," Klappa added. "Overall, our gas and electricity networks held up well, and we were able to meet the record winter demands for energy in our region.
"During the quarter, we also made progress on our Power the Future plan. This year, we will invest nearly $1.2 billion to upgrade the energy infrastructure of the region," Klappa said. "In fact, two major projects-our Blue Sky Green Field wind farm and the second natural gas-fired unit at Port Washington-are expected to enter commercial service within the next 60 days."
Earnings per share listed in this news release are on a fully diluted basis.
