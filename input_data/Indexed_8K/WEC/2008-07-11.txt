ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.
 
On July 7, 2008, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin ("PSCW") issued a Final Decision approving a retail electric rate increase for Wisconsin Electric Power Company ("Wisconsin Electric") of $118.9 million (5.1%) to recover significant increases in fuel costs. The PSCW had approved an interim increase of $76.9 million (3.3%) on April 14, 2008. The increase in fuel costs is being driven primarily by (i) increases in the price of natural gas and (ii) the higher cost of transporting coal by rail as a result of increases in the cost of diesel fuel. The increased rates were effective July 8, 2008. The revenues that Wisconsin Electric collects as a result of this Final Decision are subject to refund with interest at a rate of 10.75%, Wisconsin Electric's authorized rate of return, if the fuel costs recovered in rates exceed actual fuel costs for calendar year 2008.
In addition, on July 10, 2008, the PSCW issued a Final Decision granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Units 5, 6, 7 and 8 at its Oak Creek Power Plant, at an estimated cost of $830 million, including Allowance For Funds Used During Construction. The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
