Wisconsin Energy posts second quarter earnings
MILWAUKEE -Wisconsin Energy (NYSE: WEC) today reported net income from continuing operations of $58.3 million or 49 cents per share for the second quarter of 2008. This compares with net income from continuing operations of $57.7 million or 49 cents per share in the corresponding period a year ago. Second quarter 2008 results were helped by additional earnings from the company's Power the Future plan, including the new Port Washington generating unit that began commercial service in May. Results in last year's second quarter were increased by the settlement of a billing dispute and a gain on the sale of land. Residential use of electricity was down by 4.2 percent from the second quarter a year ago - driven by cooler weather and the lack of air conditioning demand in June. Consumption of electricity by large commercial and industrial customers was down 1.2 percent, while use of electricity by small commercial and industrial customers declined by 3.0 percent. At the end of June, the company was serving 6,996 more electric customers and 8,310 more natural gas customers than a year ago. Second quarter 2008 revenues from continuing operations were $946 million compared with $907 million in the second quarter last year. "We reached another milestone in this year's second quarter as our customers began realizing the benefits of two major components of our Power the Future plan," said Gale Klappa, Wisconsin Energy's chairman, president and chief executive officer. "In May, our generating capacity increased with the startup of our second natural gas-fueled unit at Port Washington and the commercial operation of 88 wind turbines at our Blue Sky Green Field wind farm." Klappa continued, "These projects add nearly 700 megawatts of capability to our system and are key to the diverse energy portfolio we're building to support the region's economy in the years ahead."
