Wisconsin Energy posts third quarter and nine-month results
 
MILWAUKEE - Wisconsin Energy (NYSE:WEC) today reported net income from continuing operations of $77 million or 65 cents a share for the third quarter of 2008. This compares with net income from continuing operations of $83 million or 70 cents a share in the third quarter last year.
For the first nine months of 2008, net income from continuing operations reached $259 million or $2.19 a share. On a comparable basis, earnings for the first nine months last year were $242 million or $2.04 a share.
Total sales of electricity declined by nearly 3.8 percent in this year's third quarter - the result of cool summer weather and minimal demand for air conditioning.
Residential use of electricity fell by 5 percent in this year's third quarter. Usage by residential customers fell 2.2 percent in the first nine months of 2008.
Consumption of electricity by small commercial and industrial customers fell by 1.4 percent and 1 percent, respectively, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2008.
Electricity use by large commercial and industrial customers fell by 3.5 percent in the third quarter and 1 percent compared to the first nine months of 2007.
Third quarter 2008 revenues from continuing operations were $852 million. In the corresponding period last year, revenues from continuing operations were $882 million.
"We posted solid financial results in the first nine months of this year," said Gale Klappa, Wisconsin Energy's chairman, president and chief executive officer. "And our focus remains on delivering world-class reliability for our customers at prices that are below the national average."
