Wisconsin Energy Corporation posts fourth quarter and full-year results for 2008
MILWAUKEE - Wisconsin Energy (NYSE: WEC) today reported earnings from continuing operations of $100 million or 85 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2008. This compares with earnings from continuing operations of $95 million or 80 cents per share for the final quarter of 2007.
Fourth quarter revenues were $1.20 billion in 2008, compared with $1.15 billion in the same period last year. For the full year 2008, revenues were $4.43 billion, compared with $4.24 billion in 2007.
Wisconsin Energy's 2008 earnings from continuing operations totaled $359 million or $3.03 per share. In 2007, earnings from continuing operations were $336 million or $2.84 per share.
Retail sales of electricity in 2008 decreased by 2.2 percent as compared with the previous year. Use of electricity by residential customers was down by 1.6 percent in 2008 - in large part because of cool summer weather. Commercial and industrial electric sales declined by 2.5 percent as compared with the prior year - a reflection of the slowdown in the economy.
Positive factors contributing to the company's 2008 earnings were effective cost controls, strong customer demand for natural gas driven by the cold winter weather and income stemming from the commercial operation of the newest generating unit at Port Washington.
"I'm very pleased with our overall performance," said Gale Klappa, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "From customer satisfaction to network reliability to progress on our Power the Future plan, the company made great strides during the year. And in a tough economy, we posted solid financial results."
Earnings per share listed in this news release are on a fully diluted basis.
