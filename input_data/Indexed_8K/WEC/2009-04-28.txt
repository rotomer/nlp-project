ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.
Wisconsin Electric Power Company ("Wisconsin Electric"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wisconsin Energy Corporation, operates under a fuel cost adjustment clause for fuel and purchased power costs associated with the generation and delivery of electricity to its retail customers in Wisconsin. Based on three months of actual fuel cost data and nine months of projected data, Wisconsin Electric forecasts that its monitored fuel cost for 2009 will fall outside the range prescribed by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin ("PSCW") and will be less than the monitored fuel cost reflected in currently authorized rates. Therefore, on April 27, 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to decrease annual Wisconsin retail electric rates by $67.2 million for calendar year 2009. Wisconsin Electric expects that the PSCW will review and act upon this request during the second quarter of 2009.
