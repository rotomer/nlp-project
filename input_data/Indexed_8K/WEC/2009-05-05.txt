Wisconsin Energy posts first quarter earnings
MILWAUKEE - Wisconsin Energy (NYSE: WEC) today reported net income from continuing operations of $142 million or $1.20 per share for the first quarter of 2009. This compares with earnings of $123 million or $1.04 per share from continuing operations in last year's first quarter.
Total retail sales of electricity decreased by 8.4 percent compared to the first quarter of 2008. Consumption of electricity by residential customers declined by 3.5 percent - driven by milder winter weather. Electricity use by large commercial and industrial customers was down by 17.8 percent compared with last year's first quarter, while usage by small commercial and industrial customers declined by 2.3 percent.
"The increase in earnings this quarter was largely driven by a reduction in our cost of fuel and purchased power," said Gale Klappa, Wisconsin Energy's chairman, president and chief executive officer. "On April 27, we filed a request with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to reduce retail prices for our electric customers in Wisconsin, in light of the significant drop we've seen in the cost of fuel, particularly natural gas and diesel," he added. "Overall, the company is weathering the economic downturn well with solid expense control and continuing modest growth in new customers. And I'm pleased that the latest data compiled by the U.S. Department of Energy show that our retail electric rates are significantly below the national average," Klappa said.
First quarter 2009 revenues were $1.40 billion compared with $1.43 billion in the first quarter last year. At the end of March, the company was serving 4,550 more electric customers and 6,290 more natural gas customers than a year ago.
Earnings per share listed in this news release are on a fully diluted basis.
