ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.
 
On March 25, 2010, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin ("PSCW") issued an order approving Wisconsin Electric Power Company's request to increase Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. The PSCW approved a $60.5 million increase, on an annual basis, to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel and purchased power costs is being driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas compared to the forecasted prices included when rates were last set in December 2009, changes in the timing of plant outages and increased Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator costs. The increased rates were effective March 25, 2010. The revenues that we collect pursuant to this order are subject to refund with interest at a rate of 10.40%, pending PSCW review and final approval.
