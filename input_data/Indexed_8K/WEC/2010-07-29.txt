Wisconsin Energy posts first half and second quarter 2010 earnings
MILWAUKEE -Wisconsin Energy (NYSE: WEC) today reported net income from continuing operations of $216.5 million or $1.83 a share for the first half of 2010. This compares with net income from continuing operations of $204.4 million or $1.73 a share for the first half of 2009. Continuing results exclude the operations of Edison Sault Electric Company, which was sold in May 2010 and is reported in discontinued operations.
For the quarter ended June 30, 2010, the company reported net income from continuing operations of $87.5 million or 74 cents a share - up from $63.0 million or 53 cents a share in the corresponding quarter a year ago.
Wisconsin Energy's second quarter 2010 performance was helped by a return to more normal weather and additional income from the company's Power the Future plan. Reported income from our Power the Future assets increased by 11 cents a share, driven by our $1.2 billion investment in the new Oak Creek generating unit. The unit began commercial service in February 2010.
Second quarter 2010 revenues from continuing operations were $891 million. This compares with revenue of $836 million in the second quarter last year.
Demand for electricity increased across all customer groups as compared to the second quarter of 2009. Residential electricity use rose by 1.7 percent from the second quarter a year ago. Consumption of electricity by large commercial and industrial customers grew by 14.3 percent, while use of electricity by small commercial and industrial customers increased by 4.7 percent.
Excluding the iron ore mines in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, electricity use by Wisconsin Energy's large commercial and industrial customers rose by 7.1 percent compared to the second quarter last year.
At the end of June, the company was serving 3,400 more electric customers and 4,900 more natural gas customers than a year ago.
"We're clearly seeing growth in the region, and over the past three months, stronger economic activity has been evident across virtually every sector of our customer base," said Gale Klappa, Wisconsin Energy's chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Our Power the Future investments - adding modern, efficient capacity to our generating fleet - are providing real benefits to our customers and our stockholders."
"Our revised earnings guidance for 2010 is in the range of $3.70 to $3.75 a share from continuing operations," Klappa said.
