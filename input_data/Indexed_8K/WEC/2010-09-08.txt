ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.
 
On September 3, 2010, Wisconsin Electric Power Company, a subsidiary of Wisconsin Energy Corporation, filed an application with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin ("PSCW") to reopen the docket in the 2010 rate case for the purpose of reviewing updated 2011 fuel costs and to set rates for 2011 that reflect those costs. As part of its final decision in the 2010 rate case issued on December 18, 2009, the PSCW authorized Wisconsin Electric to reopen the docket in 2010 to review updated 2011 fuel costs. Wisconsin Electric is requesting an increase in 2011 Wisconsin retail electric rates of $38.4 million (1.4%) related to the increase in 2011 monitored fuel costs as compared to the level of monitored fuel costs currently in rates. This increase is being driven primarily by an increase in the delivered cost of coal.
