Wisconsin Energy posts third quarter and nine-month earnings
MILWAUKEE -Wisconsin Energy (NYSE: WEC) today reported net income from continuing operations of $328.8 million or $2.78 a share for the first nine months of 2010. This compares with net income from continuing operations of $262.6 million or $2.23 a share for the first nine months of 2009. Continuing results exclude the operations of Edison Sault Electric Company, which was sold in May 2010 and is reported in discontinued operations.
For the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2010, the company reported net income from continuing operations of $112.3 million or 95 cents a share - up from $58.2 million or 49 cents a share in the corresponding quarter a year ago.
Third quarter 2010 revenues from continuing operations were $973.2 million. This compares with revenue of $815.5 million in the third quarter last year. This revenue growth reflects warm summer temperatures and high humidity levels which led to strong demand for air conditioning. In fact, during July, residential customers across the Wisconsin Energy footprint used more electricity than during any other month in history.
Another factor contributing to overall performance for this year's third quarter is income from the company's Power the Future plan. Reported income from our Power the Future assets increased by 11 cents a share, driven by our $1.2 billion investment in the new Oak Creek generating unit. The unit began commercial service in February 2010.
Demand for electricity increased across all customer groups as compared to the third quarter of 2009. Residential electricity use rose by 26.4 percent from the third quarter a year ago. Consumption of electricity by large commercial and industrial customers grew by 11.0 percent, while use of electricity by small commercial and industrial customers was up by 6.0 percent.
Excluding the iron ore mines in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, electricity use by Wisconsin Energy's large commercial and industrial customers rose by 4.1 percent compared to the third quarter last year.
At the end of September, the company was serving 3,600 more electric customers and 5,700 more natural gas customers than a year ago.
"We were pleased with the performance of our system during the hot summer weather. The modern, efficient capacity we have added to our generating fleet as well as the investments we have made in our distribution system are providing real value to our customers and our stockholders," said Gale Klappa, Wisconsin Energy's chairman, president and chief executive officer.
"Our revised earnings guidance for 2010 is in the range of $3.75 to $3.80 a share from continuing operations," Klappa added.
