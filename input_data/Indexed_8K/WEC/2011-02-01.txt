Wisconsin Energy Corporation posts fourth quarter
and full-year results for 2010
MILWAUKEE - Wisconsin Energy (NYSE: WEC) today reported earnings from continuing operations of $126 million or $1.06 a share for the fourth quarter of 2010. This compares with earnings from continuing operations of $113 million or 96 cents a share for the final quarter of 2009.
Fourth quarter revenues were $1.09 billion in 2010, compared with $1.06 billion in the corresponding quarter a year ago. For the full year 2010, revenues were $4.20 billion, up slightly from $4.10 billion in 2009.
Wisconsin Energy's 2010 earnings from continuing operations totaled $454 million or $3.84 per share. In 2009, earnings from continuing operations were $376 million or $3.19 per share.
Total sales of electricity to retail customers across the region rose by 6 percent during 2010. Residential use of electric energy grew by 6 percent as households responded to warm, humid summer temperatures. And electricity usage by commercial and industrial customers increased by 6.1 percent - reflecting a modest recovery in the economy.
At the end of 2010, the company was serving 2,800 more electric customers and 4,300 more natural gas customers than the prior year.
Among the positive factors contributing to the company's 2010 results were effective cost controls, warm summer weather and earnings from the first expansion unit at Oak Creek, which was placed into commercial operation in February 2010. Unit 2 at Oak Creek began commercial service on Jan. 12, 2011.
"During the past year, we completed the largest construction project in Wisconsin history - adding efficient, state of the art capacity that will serve our customers well for decades to come," said Gale Klappa, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "And on virtually every meaningful operating measure, from safety to customer satisfaction to power restoration after major storms, the company made great strides during the year."
Earnings per share listed in this news release are on a fully diluted basis and do not reflect the impact of the previously announced two-for-one stock split which will be effective March 1, 2011.
