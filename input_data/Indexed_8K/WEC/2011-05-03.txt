Wisconsin Energy posts first quarter earnings;
reaffirms earnings guidance for 2011
 
MILWAUKEE - Wisconsin Energy (NYSE: WEC) today reported net income from continuing operations of $171 million or 72 cents per share for the first quarter of 2011. This compares with earnings of $129 million or 55 cents per share from continuing operations in last year's first quarter.
 
First quarter 2011 revenue from continuing operations was $1.33 billion compared with $1.25 billion in the first quarter of 2010.
 
The company's results for the first three months of this year were helped by additional income from the company's Power the Future plan and colder winter temperatures that drove strong customer demand for natural gas.
 
"Commercial operation of the second expansion unit at Oak Creek - which took place in January of this year - was a milestone event for the company's Power the Future plan. The plan required more than $3 billion of investment in energy infrastructure that will provide reliable power for our customers for many years to come, said Gale Klappa, Wisconsin Energy's chairman, president and chief executive officer.
 
Total retail sales of electricity rose by 1.4 percent compared to the first quarter of 2010. Consumption of electricity by residential customers increased by 1.4 percent - the result of a colder winter as compared to last year.
 
Electricity use by large commercial and industrial customers was up 0.4 percent compared with last year's first quarter. The increase was driven primarily by improving economic activity in three sectors of the economy - iron ore mining, specialty steel and paper production. Usage by small commercial and industrial customers grew by 2.4 percent.

"Our earnings guidance for 2011 remains in the range of $2.05 to $2.10 per share. We're continuing to see a modest recovery in the economy, and we're continuing to keep strong expense controls in place," Klappa said.
 
At the end of March, the company was serving 1,900 more electric customers and 3,200 more natural gas customers than a year ago.
 
Earnings per share listed in this news release are on a fully diluted basis. Prior year earnings per share were restated to reflect the two-for-one stock split that occurred on March 1, 2011.
