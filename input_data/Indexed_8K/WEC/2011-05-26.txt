ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.
 
On May 26, 2011, Wisconsin Electric Power Company and Wisconsin Gas LLC (collectively, the "Company"), both subsidiaries of Wisconsin Energy Corporation, filed an application with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin ("PSCW") to initiate rate proceedings. In lieu of a traditional rate proceeding, the Company has requested an alternative approach which, if approved by the PSCW, would result in no increase in 2012 base rates for its customers. In 2012, the Company would seek base rate increases to be effective in 2013. In order for the Company to proceed under this alternative approach, the application provides that the PSCW must issue an order by July 15, 2011 that:
 
 
The application states that if the Company receives an order from the PSCW that addresses only a portion of these issues, or that includes additional conditions, the Company would instead proceed with a traditional rate case. If the Company found it necessary to proceed with a traditional rate case, Wisconsin Electric's rate request would include increases of 6.2% for its electric customers, 0.9% for its natural gas customers, 10.2% for its Valley steam utility customers and 6.9% for its Milwaukee County steam utility customers. Wisconsin Gas would request a 0.2% rate increase for its natural gas customers.
