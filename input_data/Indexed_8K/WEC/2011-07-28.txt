Wisconsin Energy posts second quarter and first half 2011 earnings
MILWAUKEE -
Wisconsin Energy (NYSE: WEC) today reported net income from continuing operations of $98 million or 41 cents a share for the second quarter of 2011. This compares with net income from continuing operations of $88 million or 37 cents a share for the second quarter of 2010.
For the first six months of 2011, the company reported net income from continuing operations of $269 million or $1.14 a share - up from $216 million or 91 cents a share in the corresponding period a year ago.
The company also reported net income from discontinued operations of 5 cents a share for the second quarter and first six months of 2011. These earnings arose from the resolution of several state and federal tax matters. Net income from discontinued operations was immaterial for all of 2010.
Wisconsin Energy's second quarter 2011 performance was helped by additional income from the company's Power the Future plan. Reported income from the company's Power the Future assets increased by 3 cents a share, driven by an investment of $668 million in the second Oak Creek generating unit. The unit began commercial service in January 2011.
Second quarter 2011 revenues totaled $992 million. This compares with revenues of $891 million for the second quarter last year.
Overall, retail sales of electricity declined by 1.2 percent as compared with the second quarter of 2010. Sales of electricity to large commercial and industrial customers grew by 1.8 percent. Sales to residential and small commercial and industrial customers were down by 3 percent, primarily the result of mild weather during the second quarter of this year and a lack of air conditioning demand during June.

At the end of June, the company was serving approximately 2,000 more electric customers and approximately 4,000 more natural gas customers than a year ago.
By virtually any meaningful measure - from customer satisfaction to network reliability to financial results - the company continues to perform at a high level, said Gale Klappa, chairman, president and chief executive officer. And we remain on plan with construction work on the new air quality controls at the original Oak Creek generating units and at the Glacier Hills Wind Park - which will become the largest wind farm in Wisconsin when it's completed later this year.
Earnings per share listed in this news release are on a fully diluted basis. Prior year earnings per share were restated to reflect the two-for-one stock split that occurred on March 1, 2011.
