WISCONSIN ENERGY CORPORATION
EXPLANATORY NOTE
Wisconsin Energy Corporation ("Wisconsin Energy") is filing this Amendment No. 1 on Form 8-K/A to its Current Report on Form 8-K, which was originally filed on May 10, 2011 (the "Original 8-K") to report the voting results from Wisconsin Energy's 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 5, 2011 (the "Annual Meeting"), for the sole purpose of disclosing Wisconsin Energy's decision as to how frequently it will include a non-binding advisory vote on the compensation of its named executive officers in its proxy materials. Except for the foregoing, this Amendment No. 1 does not amend the Original 8-K in any way and does not modify or update any other disclosures contained in the Original 8-K. Accordingly, this Amendment No. 1 should be read in conjunction with the Original 8-K.
ITEM 5.07  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.
In a non-binding advisory vote held at the Annual Meeting regarding the frequency that Wisconsin Energy should hold non-binding advisory votes on the compensation of its named executive officers (every one, two or three years), the frequency of one year received the highest number of votes cast. In light of this result, Wisconsin Energy's Board of Directors has determined that Wisconsin Energy will hold non-binding advisory votes on named executive officers' compensation on an annual basis until such time as the next advisory vote is submitted to stockholders regarding the frequency of advisory votes on executive compensation or the Board otherwise determines that a different frequency for such advisory votes is in the best interest of stockholders.
