Wisconsin Energy posts third quarter and nine month earnings
MILWAUKEE -
Wisconsin Energy (NYSE: WEC) today reported net income from continuing operations of $129.8 million or 55 cents a share for the third quarter of 2011. This compares with net income from continuing operations of $112.3 million or 47 cents a share for the third quarter of 2010.
For the first nine months of 2011, the company reported net income from continuing operations of $398.7 million or $1.69 a share -- up from $328.8 million or $1.39 a share in the corresponding period a year ago.
A major factor contributing to this year's third quarter performance was income from the company's Power the Future plan. Earnings from Power the Future assets rose by 3 cents a share, driven by investment in the second new generating unit at the company's Oak Creek site. The second expansion unit at Oak Creek began commercial service in January.
During this year's third quarter, consumption of electricity by large commercial and industrial customers grew 0.3 percent, while electricity use by small commercial and industrial customers was up 1.0 percent. Residential electricity use was down by 2.3 percent from the third quarter a year ago.
Summer temperatures in the Midwest were warmer than normal this year. But the summer of 2010 was one of the hottest on record, said Gale Klappa, chairman, president and chief executive of Wisconsin Energy. As a result, residential demand for air conditioning was slightly lower than we recorded in the third quarter last year.
At the end of September, the company was serving 2,114 more electric customers and 4,170 more natural gas customers than a year ago.

In total, we've invested $7.8 billion since 2003 to upgrade the energy infrastructure of the region, added Klappa. Those investments are paying real dividends for our customers in the form of high reliability and dramatically improved environmental performance, Klappa said.
Earnings per share listed in this news release are on a fully diluted basis. Prior year earnings per share were restated to reflect the two-for-one stock split that occurred on March 1, 2011.
