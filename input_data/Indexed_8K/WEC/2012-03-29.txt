WISCONSIN ENERGY CORPORATION
ITEM 7.01  REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.
Effective March 29, 2012, Wisconsin Energy Corporation is reaffirming its 2012 annual earnings guidance of $2.24 to $2.29 per share from continuing operations. However, because of the warmest winter in more than 100 years -- which led to a significant reduction in customer demand for natural gas -- Wisconsin Energy expects its first quarter 2012 earnings to be $0.72 to $0.73 per share from continuing operations. This compares with the company's initial guidance of $0.75 to $0.78 per share provided on its February 2, 2012 earnings call.
