Wisconsin Energy posts 2012 second quarter and first half results
MILWAUKEE -
Wisconsin Energy (NYSE: WEC) today reported net income from continuing operations of $119.3 million or 51 cents a share for the second quarter of 2012. This compares with net income from continuing operations of $98.0 million or 41 cents a share in the second quarter of 2011.
For the first six months of 2012, the company recorded net income from continuing operations of $291.4 million or $1.25 a share - up from $268.9 million or $1.14 a share in the corresponding period a year ago.
Second quarter 2012 revenues were $944.7 million, compared with $991.7 million in the same quarter of 2011.
The improvement in second quarter earnings was driven by warm summer temperatures, lower operation and maintenance costs, and the positive impact of the company's share repurchase program.
During the second quarter, residential use of electricity rose by 8.3 percent over last year's second quarter. Consumption of electricity by small commercial and industrial customers grew by 5 percent, while electricity use by large commercial and industrial customers dropped by 3.7 percent.
At the end of June, the company was serving approximately 2,800 more electric customers and 4,200 more natural gas customers than a year ago.

Our second quarter performance was strengthened by energy demand from our residential and small commercial customers -- particularly during June when average temperatures across the region were well above normal, said Gale Klappa, chairman, president and chief executive officer. While our large commercial and industrial sales were down, they were in line with our expectations. A planned outage affected the operations of our largest customer, and that outage is continuing in the third quarter, he added.
We also made excellent progress on our biomass-fueled power plant in northern Wisconsin. Construction of the 50-megawatt facility is 39 percent complete. We're on budget and targeting an in-service date by the end of 2013, Klappa said.
Earnings per share listed in this news release are on a fully diluted basis.
