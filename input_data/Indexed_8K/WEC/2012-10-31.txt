Wisconsin Energy posts third quarter and nine month results
MILWAUKEE -
Wisconsin Energy (NYSE: WEC) today reported net income from continuing operations of $156.1 million or 67 cents a share for the third quarter of 2012. This compares with net income from continuing operations of $129.8 million or 55 cents a share for the third quarter of 2011.
For the first nine months of 2012, the company recorded net income from continuing operations of $447.5 million or $1.92 a share - up from $398.7 million or $1.69 a share in the corresponding period a year ago.
Factors contributing to the positive third quarter performance include lower operation and maintenance costs, warm summer temperatures, stronger recovery of fuel costs, and the positive impact of the company's share repurchase program.
For the third quarter, consumption of electricity by small commercial and industrial customers grew by 0.7 percent, while residential electricity use was down by 1.2 percent.
Our third quarter performance was strengthened by near record energy demand in early July as temperatures rose to the 100-degree mark across the region, said Gale Klappa, chairman, president and chief executive officer. However, high humidity and warmer than normal temperatures persisted throughout the third quarter last year. So our residential sales registered a small decline compared to the third quarter a year ago, Klappa added.
Electricity use by large commercial and industrial customers dropped by 8.3 percent. The decline was driven by lower sales stemming from a planned outage at a major iron ore mine and two customers adding self-generation. Excluding sales to the mines and the two customers that added self-generation, electricity use by large commercial and industrial customers rose by 0.6 percent compared to the third quarter a year ago.

While our large commercial and industrial sales were down, they were in line with our expectations. Our largest customer in Michigan experienced a planned outage that began in the second quarter and continued through the third quarter, said Klappa. The planned outage is now complete, and demand from the iron ore mines has returned to normal levels.
At the end of September, the company was serving approximately 3,300 more electric customers and 5,200 more natural gas customers than a year ago.
From customer satisfaction to network reliability, our companies are performing at a
high level, and we continue to make excellent progress on our biomass-fueled power plant in northern Wisconsin. Construction of the 50-megawatt facility is nearly 50 percent complete.  We're on budget and targeting an in-service date by the end of 2013,
Klappa said.
