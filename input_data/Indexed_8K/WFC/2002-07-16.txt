EXHIBIT 99
        Wells Fargo & Company's financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2002
        
In accordance with FAS 142, effective January 1, 2002, amortization of goodwill was discontinued. For comparability, all amounts for 2001 in the text on pages 1-3 of this exhibit have been adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization. For 2002, the first quarter transitional goodwill impairment charge of $276 million is excluded. The table on page 7 reconciles reported earnings to adjusted earnings.
        Wells Fargo & Company reported diluted earnings per common share of $.82 for the second quarter of 2002, compared with $.70 in the second quarter of 2001, up 17 percent. Net income was a record $1.42 billion, up 17 percent from $1.22 billion in the second quarter of 2001. For the first six months of 2002, net income was a record $2.80 billion, or $1.62 per share, compared with $2.52 billion, or $1.45 per share, for the first six months of 2001, an increase in earnings per share of 12 percent. All net income and per share data for 2001 described above exclude the impairment and other special charges recorded in second quarter 2001 of $1.16 billion after tax, or $.67 per share, predominantly related to other-than-temporary impairment of publicly traded and private equity securities, primarily in the venture capital portfolio.
        "We're very pleased with our solid financial performance in the second quarter of 2002," said CFO Howard Atkins. "On a comparable basis of accounting for goodwill, diluted earnings per share were $.82, up 17 percent from the second quarter 2001 $.70 per share (excluding second quarter 2001 non-cash impairment and other special charges), and have grown steadily each quarter since second quarter 2001. Our second quarter performance reflected a continuation of double-digit core revenue growth (up 15 percent), prudent expense growth (up 10 percent), and reductions in net credit losses," said Atkins. Second quarter results included a net loss of $13 million in market-sensitive revenue (fixed income and equity investments) compared with a net gain of $86 million, or $.03 per share, in the same period last year (excluding the second quarter 2001 non-cash impairment). On the same basis, year-to-date diluted earnings per share of $1.62 were up 12 percent over the previous year.
        Excluding market-sensitive revenue and acquisitions, revenue increased 15 percent from second quarter 2001 and also 15 percent for the first six months of 2002 compared with the same 2001 period. "Growth in core revenue reflected a continuation of strong sales of consumer loans and core deposit products, solid net interest margin, and broad-based growth in fee income," said Atkins. Market-sensitive revenue for second quarter 2002 included $45 million in gains realized on fixed income securities sold to shorten the duration of the bond portfolio, offset by a loss of $58 million, largely due to write-downs, net of realized gains, in private equity investments.
        Loans averaged $179.2 billion for second quarter 2002 and $175.7 billion for the first six months of 2002, up 11 percent and 9 percent, respectively, over the same periods a year ago. Adjusting for acquisitions, average loans in second quarter 2002 increased 9 percent from a year ago and 14 percent (annualized) from the first quarter of 2002. "Led by continued
strong sales of home equity and home mortgage products, our average consumer loans grew 21 percent from the second quarter of 2001 and 22 percent (annualized) from the first quarter of 2002," said Atkins. "Although we saw an increase in loan applications from smaller middle market commercial customers, commercial loan demand in total was still essentially flat."
        Average core deposits of $179.4 billion for second quarter 2002 grew $11.2 billion, or 7 percent, since second quarter last year. Interest and noninterest checking, market rate and other savings accounts grew in total $17.5 billion, or 13 percent, since last year and $2.5 billion, or 7 percent (annualized), from the first quarter of 2002. Excluding the acquisition of Marquette Banks, growth in these deposit categories was 11 percent from last year and 5 percent (annualized) on a linked quarter basis.
        Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis was $3.67 billion in second quarter 2002, up 21 percent from second quarter of last year, largely due to solid growth in loans and increases in net interest margin from 5.31 percent a year ago to 5.66 percent in second quarter 2002. Net interest income was essentially flat on a linked quarter basis since the net interest margin and total average earning assets were both essentially the same in second quarter as in first quarter. A $7.1 billion increase in average consumer and commercial loans was offset in the second quarter by a $10.6 billion decline in average mortgage loans held for sale related to the first quarter moderate slowdown in the mortgage pipeline. "With the recent decline in longer term interest rates, mortgage applications once again surged late in the second quarter. The mortgage pipeline at June 30, 2002 was a quarter-end record and mortgage loans held for sale began to build again although at lower spreads due to a flattening in the yield curve," said Atkins.
        Excluding market-sensitive income and acquisitions, noninterest income increased 9 percent in second quarter 2002 from second quarter 2001 and 18 percent (annualized) from first quarter 2002. "Fee income growth was solid across all business lines in the second quarter, including increases in deposit service charges, credit card fees, trust and investment management and mortgage, reflecting the breadth of our product line," said Atkins. Based on claims experience and conservative projections for used car prices, the Company took a second quarter 2002 charge of $53 million for estimated auto residual losses over the remaining lease terms that are not expected to be covered under loss contingency provisions in its various residual insurance policies. The losses are primarily concentrated in one older, liquidating portfolio.
        Noninterest expense was $3.40 billion in second quarter 2002 compared with $3.10 billion in second quarter 2001 and $3.33 billion in first quarter 2002. Adjusted for acquisitions and merger-related expenses of $14 million, noninterest expense was up 10 percent from a year ago and 8 percent (annualized) from first quarter 2002. Second quarter expenses also included one-time costs of $21 million for premises writedowns and sublease terminations on recently vacated buildings.
        The efficiency ratio was 56.6 percent in the second quarter 2002 and 57.4 percent in the second quarter 2001 (excluding second quarter 2001 impairment and other special charges). Excluding market-sensitive revenue, the efficiency ratio was 56.5 percent in second quarter 2002 compared with 58.3 percent in second quarter 2001 and 56.0 percent in first quarter 2002.
        "Our credit results continued to be encouraging. Losses have declined significantly in each of the last two quarters and for second quarter 2002 were below last year's second quarter," said chief credit officer David Munio. "However, due to the uncertain economy and the instability in the corporate environment, the potential for higher credit losses at some point remains."
        Second quarter credit losses of $387 million, .87 percent of average loans (annualized), were down 28 percent from the high of $536 million (1.27 percent) in the fourth quarter of 2001, 21 percent lower than the $487 million (1.15 percent) recorded in the first quarter of 2002 and 9 percent lower than the $427 million (1.06 percent) in the same quarter last year.
        "Second quarter losses declined in our middle market commercial business segments due to early problem recognition last year and more recently somewhat stabilized business conditions," said Munio. "In our consumer portfolios we continue to be encouraged by lower than projected bankruptcies and relatively stable loss rates. Our well diversified portfolio continued to contribute positively to our credit results. The provision for loan losses was $410 million in the second quarter, $23 million in excess of net losses largely because the Company is adopting a loss recognition policy in certain consumer finance businesses under which loss recognition will be based primarily on contractual delinquency rather than a combination of contractual delinquency and recency. The total allowance for loan losses of $3.88 billion was 2.10 percent of total loans at June 30, 2002, compared with 2.15 percent at March 31, 2002 and 2.28 percent at June 30, 2001.
        June 30, 2002 nonperforming assets of $1.86 billion, 1.01 percent of total loans outstanding, increased $51 million, or 3 percent, from March 31, 2002, and would have declined 3 percent excluding a single, large commercial credit transferred to nonperforming loans during the quarter.
