EXHIBIT 99
Wells Fargo & Company's financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2002
In accordance with FAS 142, effective January 1, 2002, amortization of goodwill was discontinued. For comparability, all amounts for 2001 in the text on pages 1-3 of this exhibit have been adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization. For 2002, the first quarter transitional goodwill impairment charge of $276 million is excluded. The table on page 6 reconciles reported earnings to adjusted earnings.
        Wells Fargo & Company reported diluted earnings per common share of $.84 for the third quarter of 2002, compared with $.75 in the third quarter of 2001, up 12 percent. Net income was $1.44 billion, up 10 percent from $1.31 billion in the third quarter of 2001. For the first nine months of 2002, net income was $4.24 billion, or $2.46 per share, compared with $3.83 billion, or $2.20 per share, for the first nine months of 2001, an increase in earnings per share of 12 percent. All net income and per share data for the first nine months of 2001, described above, exclude the non-cash impairment and other special charges recorded in second quarter 2001 of $1.16 billion after tax, or $.67 per share.
        "Our third quarter performance reflected a continuation of broad-based, double-digit revenue growth, excluding market-sensitive income and acquisitions, improved credit quality and well-controlled expenses," said Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins. Third quarter results included a net loss of $31 million in market-sensitive income compared with a net gain of $39 million, or $.01 per share, in the same period last year. Year-to-date diluted earnings per share of $2.46 were up 12 percent over the previous year, as adjusted for last year's impairment and other special charges of $1.16 billion.
        Excluding market-sensitive income and acquisitions, revenue increased 10 percent from third quarter 2001 and 13 percent for the first nine months of 2002 compared with the same period in 2001. "Growth in revenue, excluding market-sensitive income and acquisitions, reflected strong sales of consumer loans, home mortgages and core deposit products," said Atkins. Due to the decline in longer term interest rates during the third quarter, the Company realized $121 million in gains on certain longer-maturity mortgage-backed securities subject to prepayment risk. The Company also recorded $152 million of net writedowns in equity investments, the majority of which were in publicly-traded equity securities. At quarter end, the Company had net unrealized gains of $1.71 billion on bond and equity investments available for sale.
        Loans averaged $181.8 billion for third quarter 2002 and $177.7 billion for the first nine months of 2002, up 11 percent and 10 percent, respectively, over the same periods a year ago. Adjusted for acquisitions, average loans in third quarter 2002 increased 9 percent from a year ago and 6 percent (annualized) from second quarter 2002. "We saw strong consumer loan growth, led by robust sales of home equity and home mortgage products," said Atkins. "Our average consumer loans increased 24 percent from the third quarter of 2001 and 27 percent (annualized) from the second quarter of 2002. Due to the ongoing strong mortgage refinancing activity, mortgage loans held for sale increased $11.8 billion from an average of $26.6 billion in the second quarter of 2002 to an average of $38.4 billion in the third quarter of 2002. Although we added new business customers, commercial loan demand remained essentially flat."
        Average core deposits of $184.5 billion for third quarter 2002 grew $13.7 billion, or 8 percent, since the third quarter of last year and $5.1 billion, or 11.3 percent (annualized), from second quarter 2002. Excluding acquisitions, average core deposits grew 6 percent since the third quarter of last year and 12 percent (annualized) from second quarter 2002. Interest and noninterest checking, market rate and other savings accounts grew in total $18.7 billion, or 13 percent, from last year, and $6.1 billion, or 15 percent (annualized), from second quarter 2002. These increases reflected growth in primary account relationships among Community Banking and Wholesale Banking customers as well as the increase in mortgage escrow balances.
        Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis was $3.7 billion in third quarter 2002, up 15 percent from third quarter of last year, largely due to solid growth in loans and mortgages held for sale, and increases in net interest margin from 5.40 percent a year ago to 5.52 percent in third quarter 2002. On a linked quarter basis, net interest income increased $55 million, or 6 percent (annualized), due to a $9.9 billion increase in average earning assets, partly offset by a 14 basis point decline in the net interest margin. The earning asset growth of $9.9 billion included an increase of $11.8 billion in mortgages held for sale and $4.1 billion in consumer loans, offset by a $4.5 billion decline in the securities portfolio.
        "The single largest driver of both the increase in earning assets and the decline in the margin during the quarter was the extraordinary volume we experienced with mortgage refinancing activity," said Atkins. As fundings built in the quarter, mortgage loans held for sale grew to $42.3 billion at September 30, 2002 from $24.7 billion at June 30, 2002. While the increase in mortgage loans held for sale had a positive impact on income, it was also a principal factor for the reduction in net interest margin since the loans in the warehouse during the third quarter yielded 45 basis points less on average than the second quarter due to the decline in mortgage interest rates. Mortgage originations for the third quarter 2002 were $89 billion, up $27 billion over second quarter 2002 and $221 billion year-to-date, up $19 billion over the same period in 2001. The mortgage pipeline ended the quarter at $89 billion, up $41 billion from June 30, 2002. Based on the Company's quarter-end mortgage application pipeline of $89 billion, it expects mortgage loans held for sale to remain high throughout the fourth quarter 2002. The owned servicing portfolio now exceeds half-a-trillion dollars, ending the quarter at $510 billion, up $85 billion from year-end 2001. The portfolio's weighted average note rate dropped to 6.87 percent, down from 7.18 percent at December 31, 2001. Reflecting the historically low rates, mortgage servicing rights were carried on the balance sheet at $4.4 billion on September 30, 2002, down $1.8 billion from December 31, 2001.
        Excluding market-sensitive income and acquisitions, noninterest income increased 4 percent in third quarter 2002 from third quarter 2001. "We experienced solid fee growth in many of our businesses, including deposit service charges, credit card fees, mortgage banking, and home equity lines and loans," said Atkins. "However, the weak stock market compared with the second quarter of 2002 negatively impacted trust and investment fees. Insurance revenue was down $35 million from the second quarter primarily due to normal seasonality in that business."
        Noninterest expense was $3.41 billion in third quarter 2002 compared with $3.03 billion in third quarter 2001 and $3.41 billion in second quarter 2002. "Most of the increase in noninterest expense from last year was attributable to the robust growth of Wells
Fargo mortgage and home equity businesses," said Atkins. "Apart from mortgage and home equity, expenses were up 2.6 percent from third quarter 2001 and were down $93 million, or 3.5 percent, from second quarter 2002. Despite the upward pressure on costs for health care and other employee benefits year over year, expenses have been contained due to our disciplined and focused expense management across the Company. The decline in expenses from the second quarter of 2002 to the third quarter was also in part due to the seasonality of our insurance business," said Atkins.
        The efficiency ratio of 56.4 percent in third quarter 2002 (54.6 percent excluding market-sensitive income and acquisitions) improved slightly from second quarter 2002.
        Third quarter credit losses were $415 million, or .91 percent of average loans outstanding (annualized), including $21 million of charges already provided for in the second quarter of 2002. As disclosed last quarter, these charges were due to the adoption of a new delinquency and loss recognition policy in the consumer finance businesses. Excluding these charges, third quarter credit losses of $394 million were essentially flat compared with the second quarter 2002, were equal to the quarterly provision of $395 million, and were well below the $454 million of losses recorded in the third quarter 2001. For the first nine months of 2002, the provision of $1.30 billion approximately equaled charge-offs.
        September 30, 2002 non-performing assets of $1.74 billion, .9 percent of total loans outstanding, fell $126 million, or 7 percent, from the prior quarter and for the first time since the second quarter of 2001 are below 1 percent of total loans outstanding. At September 30, 2002, the allowance for loan losses was $3.86 billion, or 2.07 percent of total loans outstanding.
        The following appears in accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:
        The foregoing discussion contains forward-looking statements about the Company. Broadly speaking, forward-looking statements consist of descriptions of plans or objectives for future operations, products or services, forecasts of revenues, earnings or other measures of economic performance, and assumptions underlying or relating to any of the foregoing. Because forward-looking statements discuss future events or conditions and not historical facts, they often include words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "plan," "project," "target," "can," "could," "may," "should," "will," "would" or similar expressions. An example of forward-looking statements in this document is the statement that we expect mortgage loans held for sale to remain high throughout the fourth quarter 2002.
        Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements. They give the Company's expectations about the future and are not guarantees. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update them to reflect changes that occur after that date.
        There are several factorsmany beyond the Company's controlthat could cause results to differ significantly from the Company's expectations. Factors such as credit, market, operational, liquidity, interest rate and other risks are described in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2002 and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001, including information incorporated into the Form 10-K from the Company's 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders, filed as Exhibit 13 to the Form 10-K. See, for example, Items 2 and 3 of the Form 10-Q and "Financial ReviewRisk Management" included in the 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders and incorporated by reference into the Form 10-K.
        Other factors described in the Form 10-Q and Form 10-K include     -     business and economic conditions      -     fiscal and monetary policies     -     legislation and regulation     -     disintermediation      -     competition generally and in light of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act     -     potential dividend restrictions      -     market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services     -     non-banking activities      -     reliance on other companies for infrastructure components     -     integration of acquired companies      -     attracting and retaining key personnel     -     stock price volatility. See, for example, "Factors That May Affect Future Results" in the Form 10-Q and "Regulation and Supervision" in the Form 10-K.
        Any factor described in this document, in the Form 10-Q or in the Form 10-K, or in any information incorporated by reference therein, could, by itself or together with one or more other factors, adversely affect the Company's business, earnings and/or financial condition.
