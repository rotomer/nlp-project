EXHIBIT 99
Wells Fargo & Company's financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2002
In accordance with FAS 142, effective January 1, 2002, amortization of goodwill was discontinued. For comparability, all amounts for 2001 in the text on pages 1-3 of this exhibit have been adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization. For 2002, the first quarter transitional goodwill impairment charge of $276 million is excluded. The table on page 6 reconciles reported earnings to adjusted earnings.
        Wells Fargo & Company reported diluted earnings per common share of $.86 for the fourth quarter of 2002, compared with $.77 in the fourth quarter of 2001, up 12 percent. Net income was $1.5 billion, up 10 percent from $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2001. For the full year 2002, net income was $5.7 billion, or $3.32 per share, compared with $5.2 billion, or $2.97 per share, for the full year 2001, an increase in earnings per share of 12 percent. All net income and per share data for 2001, described above, exclude the non-cash impairment and other special charges recorded in second quarter 2001 of $1.16 billion after tax, or $.67 per share.
        Excluding market-sensitive income and acquisitions, revenue increased 11 percent from the fourth quarter 2001 and 13 percent for the full year 2002 compared with 2001. Total revenue (unadjusted) for the full year 2002 increased by 22 percent from a year ago. "Revenue growth reflected solid, broad-based sales of core deposit, consumer loan and mortgage products and a modest improvement in trust and investment fees and income from capital markets activities," said Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins.
        In line with the decline in long-term interest rates during the quarter, the Company realized $91 million in gains on sales of certain mortgage-backed securities. The Company also recorded $96 million of net write-downs on equity investments during the quarter, most of which was for private equity investments. At December 31, 2002, the Company had net unrealized gains of $1.7 billion on equity and debt securities available for sale.
        Loans averaged $183.8 billion for fourth quarter 2002 and $179.3 billion for the full year 2002, up 10 percent over the same periods a year ago. Adjusted for acquisitions, average loans in fourth quarter 2002 increased 8 percent from a year ago and 5 percent (annualized) from third quarter 2002.
        "Excluding mortgage loans held for sale, which increased $18.7 billion in the quarter, average consumer loans increased $13 billion, or 24 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2001 and $3 billion, or 19 percent (annualized), from the third quarter of 2002," said Atkins. "The growth in consumer loans was driven by continued strong demand for home equity loans and lines, as well as solid growth in credit card balances and consumer finance receivables. For the first time in many quarters, commercial loans increased in the fourth quarter. Average commercial loans were up $144 million, or 1 percent. At year-end, commercial loans of $47.3 billion were up 4 percent from September 30, 2002."
        Average core deposits of $194.9 billion for fourth quarter 2002 grew $19.1 billion, or 11 percent, from the fourth quarter of last year and $10.4 billion, or 23 percent (annualized), from third quarter 2002. Excluding acquisitions, average core deposits grew 9 percent since the fourth quarter of last year and about 20 percent (annualized) from third quarter 2002.
Average interest- and noninterest-bearing checking accounts and market rate and other savings accounts grew $23.0 billion, or 15 percent, from last year, and $11.4 billion, or 28 percent (annualized), from third quarter 2002. "We saw strong commercial and consumer deposit growth from new primary account relationships in Wholesale Banking and Community Banking, and increases in mortgage escrow balances from growth in our mortgage servicing portfolio and from mortgage refinancing activities," said Atkins.
        Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis was $3.89 billion in fourth quarter 2002, up 13 percent from fourth quarter of last year. This increase reflected a 14 percent growth in average earning assets, largely due to solid growth in loans and mortgages held for sale, offset by a modest decline in the net interest margin from 5.50 percent in fourth quarter 2001 to 5.44 percent in the fourth quarter 2002. On a linked-quarter basis, net interest income rose 18 percent (annualized). The principal driver was an $18.7 billion increase in average mortgage loans held for sale which followed the record $89 billion mortgage origination pipeline at the start of the quarter. The 8 basis point reduction in the net interest margin on a linked-quarter basis was primarily due to the additional mortgage warehouse loans originated at lower yields in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. "Based on a mortgage pipeline of $69 billion at December 31, 2002, we believe that mortgages held for sale balances will remain high in the first quarter of 2003," said Atkins.
        Excluding market-sensitive income and acquisitions, noninterest income in fourth quarter 2002 increased 10 percent from fourth quarter 2001 and 11 percent (unannualized) from third quarter 2002. "Virtually all of our businesses achieved solid fee income growth in 2002. In addition to mortgage banking, business growth contributed solidly to increases in deposit service charges, trust and investment fees, credit card fees, capital markets activities, foreign exchange and insurance fees from Acordia, our commercial insurance brokerage," said Atkins.
        Noninterest expense was $3.8 billion in fourth quarter 2002 compared with $3.5 billion in fourth quarter 2001 and $3.4 billion in third quarter 2002. "The majority of the expense growth from last year and on a linked-quarter basis came from strong volumes in our mortgage and home equity businesses," said Atkins. "On a linked-quarter basis, expenses were up 11 percent, or $363 million. About half of this increase related to processing mortgage and home equity volume growth and approximately $100 million related to expenses in the fourth quarter to enhance revenue and reduce operating costs, including a new, regional banking systems platform, business line restructuring, corporate property and equipment write-downs, and internet initiatives. Due to growth in mortgage volume and the additional expenses listed above, the efficiency ratio was 58.1 in fourth quarter 2002 compared with 56.4 in third quarter 2002."
        "Fourth quarter 2002 credit results reflected slightly lower non-performing assets and slightly higher losses than in the third quarter, but were well below the credit losses and non-performing asset levels of the fourth quarter of 2001. The results were within our expected range and consistent with our view of the economy," said Chief Credit Officer Dave Munio. "All consumer lines of business showed strong and stable performance. Wholesale losses for the period were slightly above those of the third quarter and were spread over several lines of business and geographies."
        Fourth quarter credit losses were $438 million, or .95 percent of average loans outstanding (annualized), compared with $415 million, or .91 percent, in the third quarter of 2002 and significantly improved from $536 million, or 1.27 percent, in the fourth quarter 2001. Full year 2002 net credit losses were $1.73 billion, or ..96 percent of average loans outstanding, compared with $1.78 billion, or 1.09 percent, in 2001. "The full year 2002 results demonstrated the positive impact of our diversified loan portfolio and were aided by good underwriting, well-managed collections and a sound credit culture," said Munio.
        The fourth quarter provision expense was $438 million, equal to actual charge-offs. Full year provision expense of $1.73 billion also approximately equaled full year losses. "Our year-end 2002 allowance of $3.86 billion represented more than two times coverage of non-performing assets. While our allowance to total loans ratio was lower than a year ago, most of our loan growth during 2002 came from home equity loans and residential first mortgages, loan categories that have historically involved lower risk."
        Non-performing assets at December 31, 2002 were $1.70 billion, .9 percent of total loans, down $40 million from the prior quarter and down $116 million from fourth quarter 2001. "While we are comfortable with our year-over-year improvement in net losses and non-performing assets, we remain cautious about future loan losses and non-performing assets because of the uncertain economy," said Munio.
        
The following appears in accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:
        
The foregoing discussion contains forward-looking statements about the Company. Broadly speaking, forward-looking statements consist of descriptions of plans or objectives for future operations, products or services, forecasts of revenues, earnings or other measures of economic performance, and assumptions underlying or relating to any of the foregoing. Because forward-looking statements discuss future events or conditions and not historical facts, they often include words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "plan," "project," "target," "can," "could," "may," "should," "will," "would" or similar expressions. Examples of forward-looking statements in this document include the statement that we expect mortgage loans held for sale to remain high throughout the first quarter 2003 and various statements about future loan losses and credit quality.
        
Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements. They give the Company's expectations about the future and are not guarantees. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update them to reflect changes that occur after that date.

See, for example, Items 2 and 3 of the Form 10-Q and "Financial ReviewRisk Management" included in the 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders and incorporated by reference into the Form 10-K.
        
Other factors described in the Form 10-Q and Form 10-K include      -     business and economic conditions     -     fiscal and monetary policies     -     legislation and regulation     -     disintermediation     -     competition generally and in light of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act      -     potential dividend restrictions     -     market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services      -     non-banking activities     -     reliance on other companies for infrastructure components      -     integration of acquired companies     -     attracting and retaining key personnel     -      stock price volatility. See, for example, "Factors That May Affect Future Results" in the Form 10-Q and "Regulation and Supervision" in the Form 10-K.
        
Any factor described in this document, in the Form 10-Q or in the Form 10-K, or in any information incorporated by reference therein, could, by itself or together with one or more other factors, adversely affect the Company's business, earnings and/or financial condition.
