Dear Sirs and Mesdames:
 
Wells Fargo & Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), confirms its agreement with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Banc One Capital Markets, Inc., Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, Deutsche
Bank Securities Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Lehman Brothers Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, UBS Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Brokerage Services, LLC (individually, an "Agent", and collectively, the "Agents") with respect to the issuance and sale by the Company of its Medium-Term Notes described herein (the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued pursuant to an indenture (the "Senior Indenture") dated as of July 21, 1999, as amended from time to time, between the Company and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the "Senior Trustee"), or an indenture (the "Subordinated Indenture" and together with the Senior Indenture, referred to herein collectively as the "Indentures") dated as of August 30, 1999, as amended from time to time, between the Company and Bank One Trust Company, N.A. (successor in interest to The First National Bank of Chicago), as trustee (the "Subordinated Trustee" and together with the Senior Trustee, referred to herein collectively as the "Trustees"). As of the date hereof, the Company has authorized the issuance and sale of up to U.S. $10,000,000,000 aggregate initial public offering price (or its equivalent, based upon the applicable exchange rate at the time of issuance, in such foreign currencies or foreign currency units as the Company shall designate at the time of issuance) of Notes through the Agents pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. It is understood, however, that the Company may from time to time authorize the issuance of additional Notes and that such additional Notes may be sold pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, all as though the issuance of such Notes were authorized as of the date hereof.
 
This Agreement provides both for the sale of Notes by the Company directly to purchasers, in which case the Agents will act as agents of the Company in soliciting Note purchases, and (as may from time to time be agreed to by the Company and any Agent) to any Agent as principal for resale to purchasers.
 
The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-103711) for the registration of securities, including the Notes, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the SEC under the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations"). Such registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC and each of the Indentures has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"). Such registration statement (and any further registration statements which may be filed by the Company for the purpose of registering additional Notes and in connection with which this Agreement is included or incorporated by reference as an exhibit) and the prospectus constituting a part thereof, and any prospectus supplements relating to the Notes, including all documents incorporated therein by reference, as from time to time amended or supplemented by the filing of documents or amendments or supplements pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), or the 1933 Act or otherwise, are referred to herein as the "Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus", respectively, except that if any revised prospectus shall be provided to the Agents by the Company for use in connection with the offering of the Notes which is not required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations, the term "Prospectus" shall refer to such revised prospectus from and after the time it is first provided to the Agents for such use.
 
SECTION 1.    .
Appointment as Agents
 
(a)    .    Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and subject to the reservation by the Company of the right to sell Notes directly on its own behalf or through any of its affiliated entities and other agents, the Company hereby appoints the Agents as the agents for the purpose of soliciting purchases of the Notes from the Company by others and agrees that, except as otherwise contemplated herein, whenever the Company determines to sell Notes directly to any Agent as principal for resale to others, it will enter into a Terms Agreement (hereinafter defined) relating to such sale in accordance with Section 3(b) hereof. No Notes that the Company has agreed to sell pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to have been purchased and paid for or sold by the Company until such Notes shall have been delivered to the purchaser thereof against payment by such purchaser. The Company may accept offers to purchase Notes through an agent other than an Agent; , that the maximum commission received by any such agent will not exceed 8.00%.
Appointment of Agents
provided, however
 
(b)    .    Upon receipt of instructions from the Company, each of the Agents will use its reasonable efforts to solicit purchases of such principal amount of the Notes as the Company and such Agent shall agree upon from time to time during the term of this Agreement, it being understood that the Company shall not approve the solicitation of purchases of Notes in excess of the amount which shall be authorized by the Company from time to time or in excess of the principal amount of Notes registered pursuant to the Registration Statement. The Agents will have no responsibility for maintaining records with respect to the aggregate principal amount of Notes sold, or of otherwise monitoring the availability of Notes for sale under the Registration Statement. Each Agent will communicate to the Company, orally or in writing, each offer to purchase Notes, other than those offers rejected by such Agent. Each Agent shall have the right, in its discretion reasonably exercised, to reject any proposed purchase of Notes, as a whole or in part, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach by such Agent of this Agreement. The Company may accept or reject any proposed purchase of the Notes, in whole or in part.
Reasonable Efforts Solicitations; Right to Reject Offers
 
(c)    .    In soliciting purchases of Notes on behalf of the Company and in performing its other obligations hereunder (other than with respect to any purchase by an Agent as principal pursuant to a Terms Agreement), each Agent shall act solely as agent for the Company and not as principal. Each Agent shall make reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Notes has been solicited by such Agent and accepted by the Company; , that such Agent shall not have any liability to the Company in the event any such purchase is not consummated for any reason. If the Company shall default on its obligation to deliver Notes to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall pay to such Agent the commission it would have received had such sale been consummated and the Company shall hold such Agent harmless against any other loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default by the Company. The Agents shall not have any obligation to purchase Notes from the Company as principal, but any Agent may agree from time to time to purchase Notes as principal. Any such purchase of Notes by an Agent as principal shall be made in accordance with Section 3(b) hereof.
Solicitations as Agent; Purchases as Principal
provided, however
 
(d)    .    The Company and the Agents agree that any Notes the placement of which any Agent arranges shall be placed by such Agent, and any Notes purchased by such Agent shall be purchased, in reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company contained herein and on the terms and conditions and in the manner provided herein.

SECTION 3.    .
Solicitations as Agent; Purchases as Principal
 
(a)    .    On the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, each Agent agrees, as an agent of the Company, to use its reasonable efforts to solicit offers to purchase the Notes upon the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Prospectus.
Solicitations as Agent
 
The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend solicitation of purchases of the Notes through any Agent, as agent, commencing at any time for any period of time or permanently. Upon receipt of at least one business day's prior notice from the Company, such Agent will forthwith suspend solicitation of offers to purchase Notes from the Company until such time as the Company has advised such Agent that such solicitation may be resumed. While such solicitation is suspended, the Company shall not be required to deliver any certificates, opinions or letters in accordance with Sections 7(a), (b) and (c) hereof; , , that if the Registration Statement or Prospectus is amended or supplemented during the period of suspension (other than by an amendment or supplement providing solely for a change in the interest rates, redemption provisions, amortization schedules or maturities offered on the Notes or for a change the Agents deem to be immaterial), no Agent shall be required to resume soliciting offers to purchase Notes until the Company has delivered such certificates, opinions and letters as such Agent may request.
provided
however
 
Unless the Company and the presenting Agent or Agents otherwise agree, the Company will pay the presenting Agent (or jointly to two or all Agents if such solicitation is jointly made) on the settlement date applicable to such Note a commission equal to the applicable percentage of the principal amount of each Note sold by the Company as a result of a solicitation made by such Agent as set forth in Schedule A hereto or at a percentage negotiated at the time of sale; that the maximum commission received by any such Agent will not exceed 8.00%.

Unless the context otherwise requires, each reference contained herein to "this Agreement" shall be deemed to include any applicable Terms Agreement between the Company and an Agent. Each such Terms Agreement, whether oral or in writing, shall be with respect to such information (as applicable) as is specified in Exhibit A hereto. An Agent's commitment to purchase Notes as principal pursuant to any Terms Agreement shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations and warranties of the Company herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth. Each Terms Agreement shall specify the principal amount of Notes to be purchased by the Agent pursuant thereto, the price to be paid to the Company for such Notes (which, if not so specified in a Terms Agreement, shall be at a discount equivalent to the applicable commission set forth in Schedule A hereto), the time and place of delivery of and payment for such Notes, any provisions relating to rights of, and default by, purchasers acting together with the Agent in the reoffering of such Notes, and such other provisions (including further terms of such Notes) as may be mutually agreed upon.

Such Terms Agreement shall also specify the requirements for the officer's certificate, opinions of counsel and comfort letter pursuant to Sections 7(a), 7(b) and 7(c) hereof.

States, and each holder of Notes will be entitled to the benefits of the applicable Indenture.
 
(viii)    The statements in the Prospectus (other than statements furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of an Agent expressly for use therein) under the captions "Description of Debt Securities", "Plan of Distribution", "Description of Notes" and "Supplemental Plan of Distribution", insofar as they purport to summarize certain provisions of documents or laws specifically referred to therein, are accurate summaries of such provisions or laws or of the sources from which such summaries were derived.
 
(ix)    Each of the Indentures is qualified under the 1939 Act.
 
(x)    The Registration Statement is effective under the 1933 Act and, to the knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the 1933 Act or proceedings therefor initiated or, to the knowledge of such counsel, threatened by the SEC; and any required filing of the Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) will be made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act.
 
(xi)    The Registration Statement, the Prospectus and each amendment thereof or supplement thereto as of their respective effective or issue dates (other than financial statements and other financial and statistical data contained therein, other than statements furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of an Agent and other than the Statements of Eligibility on Form T-1 included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which no opinion need be rendered) complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1939 Act and the regulations under each of those Acts.
 
(xii)    To such counsel's knowledge, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened which are required to be disclosed in the Prospectus, other than those disclosed therein.
 
(xiii)    Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or of the Indentures, nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Notes nor the incurrence of the obligations therein contemplated, will conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default under, any indenture or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any Significant
 
Subsidiary is a party or bound and which constitutes a material contract and is set forth as an exhibit to the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K, or any other indenture or material agreement or instrument known to such counsel and to which the Company or any Significant Subsidiary is a party or bound, the breach of which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or violate any order or regulation known to such counsel to be applicable to the Company or any Significant Subsidiary of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body, or arbitrator having jurisdiction over the Company or any Significant Subsidiary; nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company.
 
(xiv)    To such counsel's knowledge, there are no contracts, indentures, mortgages, loan agreements, notes, leases or other instruments or documents required to be described or referred to in the Registration Statement or to be filed as exhibits thereto other than those described or referred to therein or filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits thereto, and the descriptions thereof or references thereto are correct.
 
(xv)    No consent, approval, authorization, order or decree of any court or governmental agency or body including the SEC is required for the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except such as may be required under the Blue Sky laws of any jurisdiction or NASD regulations in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Notes by the Agents.
 
(xvi)    Each document filed pursuant to the 1934 Act and incorporated by reference in the Prospectus complied when filed as to form in all material respects with the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations thereunder (other than financial statements and other financial and statistical data included therein, other than statements furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Agents and other than the Statements of Eligibility on Form T-1 included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which no opinion need be rendered).
 
2.    .    The opinion of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, counsel to the Agents, covering the matters referred to in subparagraph (1) under the subheadings (i), (v), (vi), (vii), (ix), (x) and (xi) above.

3.    In giving the opinions required by subsection (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this Section, Ms. Schaffner (or such other of the Company's lawyers) and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP shall each additionally state that such counsel has no reason to believe that the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereof, at the time it became effective (other than financial statements or other financial and statistical data contained therein and other than the Statements of Eligibility on Form T-1 included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which no statement need be made), contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of the date the opinion is being rendered or (if such opinion is being delivered in connection with a Terms Agreement pursuant to Section 7(b) hereof) as of the date of any Terms Agreement and at the Settlement Date with respect thereto, as the case may be (other than financial statements or other financial and statistical data contained therein and other than the Statements of Eligibility on Form T-1 included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which no statement need be made), includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; that the opinion of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP shall take no exception for statistical data other than expertised statistical data.
provided, however,
 
(b)    .    On the date hereof, the Agents shall have received a certificate signed by any Senior Vice President or Executive Vice President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company (provided that no person shall sign such certificate in more than one official capacity) dated as of the date hereof, to the effect that (i) since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Prospectus (or since the date of any applicable Terms Agreement), there has not been any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business, properties or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Prospectus, (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 2 hereof are true and correct with the same force and effect as though expressly made at and as of the date of such certificate, (iii) the Company has performed or complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the date of such certificate, and (iv) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been initiated or threatened by the SEC.

Comfort Letter
 
(d)    .    On the date hereof (and on each Settlement Date with respect to any applicable Terms Agreement), counsel to the Agents shall have been furnished with
Other Documents
 
such documents and opinions as such counsel may reasonably require for the purpose of enabling such counsel to pass upon the issuance and sale of Notes as herein contemplated and related proceedings, or in order to evidence the accuracy and completeness of any of the representations and warranties, or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained; and all proceedings taken by the Company in connection with the issuance and sale of Notes as herein contemplated shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the Agents and to counsel for the Agents.
 
(e)    .    There shall have been no material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, in the earnings, business, properties, results of operations or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not in the ordinary course of business, from that set forth in the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of the date of such solicitation or the date of such Terms Agreement that, in the judgment of such Agent, is material and adverse and makes it, in the judgment of such Agent, impracticable to proceed with the solicitation of offers to purchase Notes or the purchase by such Agent of Notes from the Company pursuant to such Terms Agreement, as the case may be.
Material Adverse Change
 
If any condition specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled when and as required to be fulfilled, this Agreement (or, at the option of any Agent, any applicable Terms Agreement) may be terminated by any Agent insofar as this Agreement relates to such Agent by notice to the Company at any time and any such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party, except that the covenant regarding provision of an earnings statement set forth in Section 4(g) hereof, the provisions concerning payment of expenses under Section 10 hereof, the indemnity and contribution agreement set forth in Sections 8 and 9 hereof, the provisions concerning the representations, warranties and agreements to survive delivery of Section 11 hereof and the provisions set forth in Sections 13, 14 and 15 hereof shall remain in effect.
 
SECTION 6.    .
Delivery of and Payment for Notes Sold through the Agents
 
Delivery of Notes sold through any Agent as agent shall be made by the Company to such Agent for the account of any purchaser only against payment therefor in immediately available funds. In the event that a purchaser shall fail either to accept delivery of or to make payment for a Note on the date fixed for settlement, the presenting Agent shall promptly notify the Company and deliver the Note to the Company, and, if such Agent has theretofore paid the Company for such Note, the Company will promptly return such funds to such Agent. If such failure occurred for any reason other than default by such Agent in the performance of its obligations hereunder, the Company will reimburse such Agent on an equitable basis for its loss of the use of the funds for the period such funds were credited to the Company's account.
 
SECTION 7.    .
Additional Covenants of the Company
 
The Company covenants and agrees with each Agent that:
 
(a)    .    If so requested by such Agent, each time that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented (other than by a Pricing Supplement, and other than by an amendment or supplement which relates
Subsequent Delivery of Certificates
 
exclusively to an offering of securities other than the Notes) or there is filed with the SEC any document incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, or (if required pursuant to the terms of a Terms Agreement) the Company sells Notes to any Agent pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to such Agent forthwith a certificate dated the date of filing with the SEC of such supplement or document, the date of effectiveness of such amendment, or the date of such sale, as the case may be, in form satisfactory to such Agent to the effect that the statements contained in the certificate referred to in Section 5(b) hereof which were last furnished to such Agent are true and correct at the time of such amendment, supplement, filing or sale, as the case may be, as though made at and as of such time (except that such statements shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to such time) or, in lieu of such certificate, a certificate of the same tenor as the certificate referred to in said Section 5(b), modified as necessary to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of delivery of such certificate.
 
(b)    .    If so requested by such Agent, each time that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented (other than by a Pricing Supplement or solely for the inclusion of additional financial information, and other than by an amendment or supplement which relates exclusively to an offering of securities other than the Notes) or there is filed with the SEC any document incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, or (if required pursuant to the terms of a Terms Agreement) the Company sells Notes to any Agent pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished forthwith to such Agent and to counsel to such Agent a written opinion of the Senior Counsel of the Company, or other counsel satisfactory to such Agent, dated the date of filing with the SEC of such supplement or document, the date of effectiveness of such amendment, or the date of such sale, as the case may be, in form and substance satisfactory to such Agent, of the same tenor as the opinion referred to in Section 5(a)(1) hereof, but modified, as necessary, to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of delivery of such opinion; or, in lieu of such opinion, counsel last furnishing such opinion to such Agent shall furnish each Agent with a letter to the effect that the Agents may rely on such last opinion to the same extent as though it was dated the date of such letter authorizing reliance (except that statements in such last opinion shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of delivery of such letter authorizing reliance).
Subsequent Delivery of Legal Opinions
 
(c)    .    If so requested by such Agent, each time that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented to include additional financial information, or there is filed with the SEC any document incorporated by reference into the Prospectus which contains additional financial information, or (if required pursuant to the terms of a Terms Agreement) the Company sells Notes to any Agent pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the Company shall cause KPMG LLP forthwith to furnish each Agent a letter, dated the date of effectiveness of such amendment, supplement or document with the SEC, or the date of such sale, as the case may be, in form satisfactory to the Agents, of the same general tenor as the letter referred to in Section 5(c) hereof but modified to relate to the Registration Statement and Prospectus, as amended and supplemented to the date of such letter, and with such changes as may be necessary to reflect changes in the financial statements and other information derived from the accounting records of the Company; that if the Registration Statement or the

provided, however,
 
Prospectus is amended or supplemented solely to include financial information as of and for a fiscal quarter, KPMG LLP may limit the scope of such letter to the unaudited financial statements included in such amendment or supplement.
 
SECTION 8.    .
Indemnification
 
(a)    .    The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Agent and each person, if any, who controls each Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party to the extent set forth below, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage or liability; that: (A) the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based on any such untrue statement or omission or such alleged untrue statement or omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Agents expressly for use in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, and (B) with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from the Prospectus, the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection (a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Agent (or any person controlling such Agent) from or through whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased the Notes concerned, to the extent that the Prospectus relating to such Notes was required to be delivered by such Agent under the 1933 Act in connection with such purchase and was not so delivered within the time required by the 1933 Act and the rules thereunder and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the Prospectus was corrected in an amendment or supplement if the Company had previously furnished copies of the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented (exclusive of material incorporated by reference) to such Agent in sufficient time for such Agent to deliver the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented prior to the consummation of such purchase. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
Indemnification of the Agents
provided, however,
 
(b)    .    Each Agent agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
Indemnification of Company
 
furnished to the Company by such Agent expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
 
(c)    .    In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing, and the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent it shall wish, jointly, with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party). Any failure to so notify shall not affect any rights that may exist other than pursuant to this Section 8. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one identified separate firm (in addition to any identified local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Agents that are indemnified parties in the case of parties to be indemnified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 8 and by the Company in the case of parties to be indemnified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 8. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its prior written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of the indemnified party.
General
 
SECTION 9.    .
Contribution
 
(a)    In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 8 hereof is for any reason held to be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless the indemnified parties although applicable in accordance with its terms, the indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the indemnified party, as incurred: (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
 
benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and each Agent, on the other hand, from the offering of the Notes to which such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense shall relate; or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and each Agent, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and each Agent, on the other hand, in connection with such offering shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by each Agent in respect thereof. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and each Agent, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by such Agent and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. Each Agent's obligation to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 shall be several in the proportion that the principal amount of the Notes the sale of which by or through such Agent gave rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities bears to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes the sale of which by or through all Agents gave rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, and not joint; that no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section, each person, if any, who controls any Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Agent, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
provided, however,
 
(b)    The Company and the Agents agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to Section 9(a) hereof were determined by allocation (even if the Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 9(a) hereof. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 9(a) hereof shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes referred to in Section 9(a) hereof that were offered and sold by or through such Agent exceeds the amount of any damages that such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
pro rata
 
SECTION 10.    .

(f)    the qualification of the Notes under Blue Sky laws in accordance with the provisions of Section 4(i) hereof, including filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Agents in connection therewith and in connection with the preparation of any Blue Sky Survey and any Legal Investment Survey;
 
(g)    the printing and delivery to the Agents in quantities as hereinabove stated of copies of the Registration Statement and any amendments thereto, and of the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto, and the delivery by each Agent of the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto in connection with solicitations or confirmations of sales of the Notes;
 
(h)    the preparation, printing, reproducing and delivery to the Agent of copies of the Indentures and all supplements and amendments thereto;
 
(i)    any fees charged by rating agencies for the rating of the Notes;
 
(j)    the fees and expenses, if any, incurred with respect to any filing with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.;
 
(k)    any advertising and other out-of-pocket expenses of the Agents incurred with the approval of the Company;
 
(l)    the cost of providing any CUSIP or other identification numbers for the Notes; and
 
(m)    the fees and expenses of any Depositary (as defined in the Indentures) and any nominees thereof in connection with the Notes.
 
SECTION 11.    .
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery
 
All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto or thereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Agent or any controlling person of any Agent, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive each delivery of and payment for any of the Notes.
 
SECTION 12.    .
Termination

Termination of this Agreement
 
(b)    .    Any Agent may terminate any Terms Agreement, in such Agent's absolute discretion, immediately upon notice to the Company, at any time prior to the Settlement Date relating thereto if there shall have occurred, since the date of such Terms Agreement, any (i) suspension or material limitation of trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange or a material disruption in settlement services in the United States, (ii) suspension of trading of any securities of the Company on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) declaration of a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in California or New York by either Federal or state authorities, (iv) lowering of the rating assigned to any debt securities of the Company by any nationally-recognized securities rating agency or public announcement by any such rating agency that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative consequences, its rating of any debt securities of the Company, or (v) outbreak or escalation of hostilities in which the United States is involved, declaration of war by Congress or change in financial markets or calamity or crisis, including, without limitation, an act of terrorism, that, in the judgment of such Agent, is material and adverse and, in the case of any of the events described in clauses (i) through (v), such event, either alone or together with any other such event, makes it, in the judgment of such Agent, impracticable to proceed with completion of the public offering of, or purchase of and payment for, the Notes.
Termination of a Terms Agreement
 
(c)    .    In the event of any such termination, none of the parties will have any liability to the other parties hereto, except that (i) each Agent shall be entitled to any commission earned in accordance with the third paragraph of Section 3(a) hereof, (ii) if at the time
General
 
of termination (a) any Agent shall own any Notes purchased pursuant to a Terms Agreement with the intention of reselling them or (b) an offer to purchase any of the Notes has been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the purchaser or his agent of the Note or Notes relating thereto has not occurred, the covenants set forth in Sections 4 and 7 hereof shall remain in effect until such Notes are so resold or delivered, as the case may be, and (iii) the covenant set forth in Section 4(g) hereof, the provisions of Section 10 hereof, the indemnity and contribution agreements set forth in Sections 8 and 9 hereof, and the provisions of Sections 11 and 15 hereof shall remain in effect.

This Security is one of the series of the Securities designated as Medium-Term Notes, Series E, of the Company, which series is limited to an aggregate principal amount of $10,000,000,000 or the equivalent thereof in one or more foreign or composite currencies minus the aggregate principal amount of the Company's Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series F which may be issued from time to time. The Securities of this series may mature at different times, bear interest, if any, at different rates, be redeemable at different times or not at all, be repayable at the option of the Holder at different times or not at all, be issued at an original issue discount and be denominated in different currencies.
 
The Securities are issuable only in registered form without coupons and will be either (a) book-entry securities represented by one or more global securities recorded in the book-entry system maintained by the Depository or (b) certificated securities issued to and registered in the names of, the beneficial owners or their nominees.

If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
Modification and Waivers; Obligation of the Company Absolute
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected, acting together as a class.

Certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences may be waived under the Indenture by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

The Redemption Percentage shall initially be equal to the Initial Redemption Percentage specified on the face hereof and shall decline at each anniversary of the Initial Redemption Date by the amount of the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction specified on the face hereof, until the Redemption Percentage is equal to 100%. The Company may exercise such option by causing the
 
Trustee to mail a notice of such redemption at least 30 but not more than 60 days prior to the applicable Redemption Date to each Holder of the Securities of this series to be redeemed. In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, the Company shall issue a new Security or Securities for the unredeemed portion hereof in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.

This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture dated as of July 21, 1999, as amended or supplemented from time to time (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Citibank, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series of the Securities designated as Medium-Term Notes, Series E, of the Company, which series is limited to an aggregate principal amount of $10,000,000,000 or the equivalent thereof in one or more foreign or composite currencies minus the aggregate principal amount of the Company's Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series F which may be issued from time to time. The Securities of this series may mature at different times, bear interest, if any, at different rates, be redeemable at different times or not at all, be repayable at the option of the Holder at different times or not at all, be issued at an original issue discount and be denominated in different currencies.
 
The Securities are issuable only in registered form without coupons and will be either (a) book-entry securities represented by one or more global securities recorded in the book-entry system maintained by the Depository or (b) certificated securities issued to and registered in the names of, the beneficial owners or their nominees.
 
Interest Rate Reset
 
The interest rate in effect from the Original Issue Date to the Initial Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof shall be the Initial Interest Rate specified on the face hereof. Commencing with the Initial Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof following the Original Issue Date specified on the face hereof, the rate at which interest on this Security is payable shall be adjusted daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually as specified on the face hereof under "Interest Reset Period". Each such adjusted rate shall be applicable from and including the Interest Reset Date to which it relates to but not including the next succeeding Interest Reset Date or until Maturity, as the case may be. Subject to applicable provisions of law and except as specified herein, on each Interest Reset Date, the rate of interest on this Security shall be the rate determined with respect to the Interest Determination Date next preceding such Interest Reset Date in accordance with the provisions of the applicable heading below and adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified on the face hereof, and/or by the multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof.
 
If any Interest Reset Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be the following Business Day, except that if the Base Rate specified above is LIBOR or EURIBOR and if such following Business Day is in the next calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
 
Accrued interest shall be calculated by multiplying the principal amount by an accrued interest factor. Such accrued interest factor shall be computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day in the period for which interest is being paid. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the interest factor for each such day will be computed by dividing the interest rate (expressed as a decimal) applicable to such day by 360, if the Base Rate is the CD Rate, the Commercial Paper Rate, EURIBOR, the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR or the Prime Rate or by the actual number of days in the year, if the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate or the CMT Rate.
 
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, all percentages resulting from any calculation referred to herein shall be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of one percentage point rounded upward (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655) and 9.876544% (or .09876544) being rounded to 9.87654% (or ..0987654)), and all dollar or other currency amounts used in or resulting from any such calculation on this Security shall be rounded to the nearest cent or, in the case of non-U.S. currency, to the nearest unit (with one-half cent being rounded upwards).
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate per annum hereon shall not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, specified on the face hereof. The Calculation Agent shall calculate the interest rate hereon in accordance with the foregoing on or before each Calculation Date.
 
The interest rate on this Security shall in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law, as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.
 
At the request of the Holder hereof, the Calculation Agent shall provide to the Holder hereof the interest rate hereon then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate that shall become effective on the next Interest Reset Date with respect to this Security. The Calculation Agent's determination of any interest rate shall be final and binding in the absence of manifest error.

The Securities of this series may mature at different times, bear interest, if any, at different rates, be redeemable at different times or not at all, be repayable at the option of the Holder at different times or not at all, be issued at an original issue discount and be denominated in different currencies.

The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture, subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on all Senior Debt of the Company, and the Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, agrees to and shall be bound by the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto.
 
Events of Default
 
If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
Modification and Waivers; Obligation of the Company Absolute
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected, acting together as a class. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding affected by certain provisions of the Indenture, acting together as a class, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with those provisions of the Indenture. Certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences may be waived under the Indenture by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
Subject to the rights of holders of Senior Debt of the Company set forth in this Security and the Indenture referred to above, no reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed, except that in the event the Company deposits money or Eligible Instruments as provided in Section 401 or 403 of the Indenture, such payments will be made only from proceeds of such money or Eligible Instruments.
 
Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance

The Redemption Percentage shall initially be equal to the Initial Redemption Percentage specified on the face hereof and shall decline at each anniversary of the Initial Redemption Date by the amount of the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction specified on the face hereof, until the Redemption Percentage is equal to 100%.

WELLS FARGO & COMPANY, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein called the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to , or registered assigns, the principal sum of Dollars ($) on the Stated Maturity Date shown above (except to the extent redeemed or repaid prior to such date) and to pay interest, if any, on the Interest Payment Dates specified above, commencing with the first Interest Payment Date specified above following the Original Issue Date specified above, and at Maturity, on the principal amount hereof, at a rate per annum equal to the Initial Interest Rate specified above until the Initial Interest Reset Date specified above following the Original Issue Date specified above and thereafter at a rate per annum determined in accordance with the provisions on the reverse hereof under the heading "Determination of CD Rate", "Determination of Commercial Paper Rate", "Determination of EURIBOR", "Determination of Federal Funds Rate", "Determination of LIBOR", "Determination of Prime Rate", "Determination of Treasury Rate" or "Determination of CMT Rate", depending upon whether the Base Rate is CD Rate,

General
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture dated as of August 30, 1999, as amended or supplemented from time to time (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Bank One Trust Company, N.A. (successor in interest to The First National Bank of Chicago), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series of the Securities designated as Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series F, of the Company, which series is limited to an aggregate principal amount of $10,000,000,000 or the equivalent thereof in one or more foreign or composite currencies minus the aggregate principal amount of the Company's Medium-Term Notes, Series E which may be issued from time to time. The Securities of this series may mature at different times, bear interest, if any, at different rates, be redeemable at different times or not at all, be repayable at the option of the Holder at different times or not at all, be issued at an original issue discount and be denominated in different currencies.
 
The Securities are issuable only in registered form without coupons and will be either (a) book-entry securities represented by one or more global securities recorded in the book-entry system maintained by the Depository or (b) certificated securities issued to and registered in the names of, the beneficial owners or their nominees.
 
The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture, subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on all Senior Debt of the Company, and the Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, agrees to and shall be bound by the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto.
 
Interest Rate Reset
 
The interest rate in effect from the Original Issue Date to the Initial Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof shall be the Initial Interest Rate specified on the face hereof. Commencing with the Initial Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof following the Original Issue Date specified on the face hereof, the rate at which interest on this Security is payable shall be adjusted daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually as specified on the face hereof under "Interest Reset Period". Each such adjusted rate shall be applicable from and including the
 
Interest Reset Date to which it relates to but not including the next succeeding Interest Reset Date or until Maturity, as the case may be. Subject to applicable provisions of law and except as specified herein, on each Interest Reset Date, the rate of interest on this Security shall be the rate determined with respect to the Interest Determination Date next preceding such Interest Reset Date in accordance with the provisions of the applicable heading below and adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified on the face hereof, and/or by the multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof.
 
If any Interest Reset Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be the following Business Day, except that if the Base Rate specified above is LIBOR or EURIBOR and if such following Business Day is in the next calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
 
Accrued interest shall be calculated by multiplying the principal amount by an accrued interest factor. Such accrued interest factor shall be computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day in the period for which interest is being paid. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the interest factor for each such day will be computed by dividing the interest rate (expressed as a decimal) applicable to such day by 360, if the Base Rate is the CD Rate, the Commercial Paper Rate, EURIBOR, the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR or the Prime Rate or by the actual number of days in the year, if the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate or the CMT Rate.
 
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, all percentages resulting from any calculation referred to herein shall be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of one percentage point rounded upward (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655) and 9.876544% (or .09876544) being rounded to 9.87654% (or .0987654)), and all dollar or other currency amounts used in or resulting from any such calculation on this Security shall be rounded to the nearest cent or, in the case of non-U.S. currency, to the nearest unit (with one-half cent being rounded upwards).
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate per annum hereon shall not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, specified on the face hereof. The Calculation Agent shall calculate the interest rate hereon in accordance with the foregoing on or before each Calculation Date.
 
The interest rate on this Security shall in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law, as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.
 
At the request of the Holder hereof, the Calculation Agent shall provide to the Holder hereof the interest rate hereon then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate that shall become effective on the next Interest Reset Date with respect to this Security. The Calculation Agent's determination of any interest rate shall be final and binding in the absence of manifest error.
