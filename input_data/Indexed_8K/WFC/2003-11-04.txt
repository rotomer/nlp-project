Dear Sirs and Mesdames:
 
Wells Fargo & Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), confirms its agreement with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (the "Purchasing Agent") with respect to the issuance and sale by the Company of its CoreNotes
SM
Due Nine Months or More From Date of Issue described herein (the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued pursuant to an indenture (the "Senior Indenture") dated as of July 21, 1999, as amended from time to time, between the Company and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the "Senior Trustee"), or an indenture (the "Subordinated Indenture" and together with the Senior Indenture, referred to herein collectively as the "Indentures") dated as of August 30, 1999, as amended from time to time, between the Company and Bank One Trust Company, N.A. (successor in interest to The First National Bank of Chicago), as trustee (the "Subordinated Trustee" and together with the Senior Trustee, referred to herein collectively as the "Trustees"). As of the date hereof, the Company has authorized the issuance and sale of up to U.S. $5,000,000,000 aggregate initial public offering price (or its equivalent, based upon the applicable exchange rate at the time of issuance, in such foreign currencies or foreign currency units as the Company shall designate at the time of issuance) of Notes through the Purchasing Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. It is understood, however, that the Company may from time to time authorize the issuance of additional Notes and that such additional Notes may be sold through or to the Purchasing Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, all as though the issuance of such Notes were authorized as of the date hereof.
 
This Agreement provides both for the sale of Notes by the Company directly to purchasers, in which case the Purchasing Agent will act as agent of the Company in soliciting Note purchases, and (as may from time to time be agreed to by the Company and the Purchasing Agent) to the Purchasing Agent as principal for resale to purchasers.
 
The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-103711), for the registration of securities, including the Notes, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the SEC under the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations"). Such registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC and
 
"CoreNotes" is a service mark of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.
each of the Indentures has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"). Such registration statement (and any further registration statements which may be filed by the Company for the purpose of registering additional Notes and in connection with which this Agreement is included or incorporated by reference as an exhibit) and the prospectus constituting a part thereof relating to senior and subordinated debt securities, and any prospectus supplements relating to the Notes, including all documents incorporated therein by reference, as from time to time amended or supplemented by the filing of documents or amendments or supplements pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), or the 1933 Act or otherwise, are referred to herein as the "Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus", respectively, except that if any revised prospectus shall be provided to the Purchasing Agent by the Company for use in connection with the offering of the Notes which is not required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations, the term "Prospectus" shall refer to such revised prospectus from and after the time it is first provided to the Purchasing Agent for such use.
 
SECTION 1. .
Appointment as Purchasing Agent
 
(a) . Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and subject to the reservation by the Company of the right to sell Notes directly on its own behalf, the Company hereby appoints the Purchasing Agent as the exclusive agent for the purpose of soliciting purchases of the Notes from the Company by others and agrees that, except as otherwise contemplated herein, whenever the Company determines to sell Notes directly to the Purchasing Agent as principal for resale to others, it will enter into a Terms Agreement (hereafter defined) relating to such sale in accordance with Section 3(b) hereof. No Notes that the Company has agreed to sell pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to have been purchased and paid for or sold by the Company until such Notes shall have been delivered to the purchaser thereof against payment by such purchaser. The Company agrees that it will not appoint any other agent to act on its behalf, or to assist it, in the placement of the Notes.
Appointment of Purchasing Agent
 
(b) . Upon receipt of instructions from the Company, the Purchasing Agent will use its reasonable efforts to solicit purchases of such principal amount of the Notes as the Company and the Purchasing Agent shall agree upon from time to time during the term of this Agreement, it being understood that the Company shall not approve the solicitation of purchases of Notes in excess of the amount which shall be authorized by the Company from time to time or in excess of the principal amount of Notes registered pursuant to the Registration Statement. The Purchasing Agent will have no responsibility for maintaining records with respect to the aggregate principal amount of Notes sold, or of otherwise monitoring the availability of Notes for sale under the Registration Statement. The Purchasing Agent will communicate to the Company, orally or in writing, each offer to purchase Notes, other than those offers rejected by the Purchasing Agent. The Purchasing Agent shall have the right, in its discretion reasonably exercised, to reject any proposed purchase of Notes, as a whole or in part, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach by the Purchasing Agent of this Agreement. The Company may accept or reject any proposed purchase of the Notes, in whole or in part.
Reasonable Efforts Solicitations; Right to Reject Offers
 
(c) . In soliciting purchases of Notes on behalf of the Company and in performing its other obligations hereunder (other than with respect to
Solicitations as Agent; Purchases as Principal
 
any purchase by the Purchasing Agent as principal pursuant to a Terms Agreement), the Purchasing Agent shall act solely as agent for the Company and not as principal. The Purchasing Agent shall make reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Notes has been solicited by the Purchasing Agent and accepted by the Company; , that the Purchasing Agent shall not have any liability to the Company in the event any such purchase is not consummated for any reason. If the Company shall default on its obligation to deliver Notes to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall pay to the Purchasing Agent the commission it would have received had such sale been consummated and the Company shall hold the Purchasing Agent harmless against any other loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default by the Company. The Purchasing Agent shall not have any obligation to purchase Notes from the Company as principal, but the Purchasing Agent may agree from time to time to purchase Notes as principal. Any such purchase of Notes by the Purchasing Agent as principal shall be made in accordance with Section 3(b) hereof.
provided, however
 
(d) . The Company and the Purchasing Agent agree that any Notes the placement of which the Purchasing Agent arranges shall be placed by the Purchasing Agent, and any Notes purchased by the Purchasing Agent shall be purchased, in reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company contained herein and on the terms and conditions and in the manner provided herein.

SECTION 7. .
Additional Covenants of the Company
 
The Company covenants and agrees with the Purchasing Agent that:
 
(a) . Each time that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented (other than by a Pricing Supplement, and other than by filing a document incorporated by reference into the Prospectus (which is hereinafter addressed) or by an amendment or supplement which relates exclusively to an offering of securities other than the Notes) or, except as set forth in the next sentence, there is filed with the SEC any document incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, or (if required pursuant to the terms of a Terms Agreement) the Company sells Notes to the Purchasing Agent pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Purchasing Agent forthwith a certificate dated the date of filing with the SEC of such supplement or document, the date of effectiveness of such amendment, or the date of such sale, as the case may be, in form satisfactory to the Purchasing Agent to the effect that the statements contained in the certificate referred to in Section 5(b) hereof which were last furnished to the Purchasing Agent are true and correct at the time of such amendment, supplement, filing or sale, as the case may be, as though made at and as of such time (except that such statements shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to such time) or, in lieu of such certificate, a certificate of the same tenor as the certificate referred to in said Section 5(b), modified as necessary to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of delivery of such certificate. If any document other than an Annual Report on Form 10-K or a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is filed
Subsequent Delivery of Certificates
 
with the SEC and incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, the Purchasing Agent agrees that the Company will be required to deliver a certificate pursuant to this subsection only after delivery of such certificate is requested by the Purchasing Agent.
 
(b) . Each time that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented (other than by a Pricing Supplement or by filing a document incorporated by reference into the Prospectus (which is hereinafter addressed) or solely for the inclusion of additional financial information, and other than by an amendment or supplement which relates exclusively to an offering of securities other than the Notes) or, except as set forth in the last sentence of this subsection, there is filed with the SEC any document incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, or (if required pursuant to the terms of a Terms Agreement) the Company sells Notes to the Purchasing Agent pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished forthwith to the Purchasing Agent and to counsel to the Purchasing Agent a written opinion of the Senior Counsel of the Company, or other counsel satisfactory to the Purchasing Agent, dated the date of filing with the SEC of such supplement or document, the date of effectiveness of such amendment, or the date of such sale, as the case may be, in form and substance satisfactory to the Purchasing Agent, of the same tenor as the opinion referred to in Section 5(a)(1) hereof, but modified, as necessary, to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of delivery of such opinion; or, in lieu of such opinion, counsel last furnishing such opinion to the Purchasing Agent shall furnish the Purchasing Agent with a letter to the effect that the Purchasing Agent may rely on such last opinion to the same extent as though it was dated the date of such letter authorizing reliance (except that statements in such last opinion shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of delivery of such letter authorizing reliance).

If any document other than an Annual Report on Form 10-K or a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, the Purchasing Agent agrees that the Company will be required to cause KPMG LLP (or such other of the Company's independent auditors) to deliver a comfort letter pursuant to this subsection only after delivery of such comfort letter is requested by the Purchasing Agent.
provided, however
 
SECTION 8. .
Indemnification
 
(a) . The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchasing Agent and each person, if any, who controls the Purchasing Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party to the extent set forth below, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage or liability; that: (A) the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based on any such untrue statement or omission or such alleged untrue statement or omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Purchasing Agent expressly for use in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and (B) with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from the Prospectus, the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection (a) shall not inure to the benefit of the Purchasing Agent (or any person controlling the Purchasing Agent), to the extent that the Prospectus was required to be delivered by the Purchasing Agent under the 1933 Act in connection with such purchase and was not so delivered within the time required by the 1933 Act and the rules thereunder and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the Prospectus was corrected in an amendment or supplement if the Company had previously furnished copies of the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented (exclusive of material incorporated by reference) to the Purchasing Agent in sufficient time for the Purchasing Agent to deliver the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented prior to the consummation of such purchase. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
Indemnification of the Purchasing Agent
provided, however,
 
(b) . The Purchasing Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in
Indemnification of Company
 
the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Purchasing Agent expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
 
(c) . In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing, and the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent it shall wish, jointly, with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party). Any failure to so notify shall not affect any rights that may exist other than pursuant to this Section 8. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one identified separate firm (in addition to any identified local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Purchasing Agent in the case of parties to be indemnified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 8 and by the Company in the case of parties to be indemnified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 8. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its prior written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of the indemnified party.
General
 
SECTION 9. .
Contribution
 
(a) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 8 hereof is for any reason held to be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless the indemnified parties although applicable in accordance with its terms, the indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and
 
expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the indemnified party, as incurred: (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Purchasing Agent, on the other hand, from the offering of the Notes to which such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense shall relate; or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Purchasing Agent, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Purchasing Agent, on the other hand, in connection with such offering shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Purchasing Agent in respect thereof. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Purchasing Agent, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Purchasing Agent and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section, each person, if any, who controls the Purchasing Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Purchasing Agent, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
 
(b) The Company and the Purchasing Agent agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to Section 9(a) hereof were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 9(a) hereof. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 9(a) hereof shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, the Purchasing Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes referred to in Section 9(a) hereof that were offered and sold by or through the Purchasing Agent exceeds the amount of any damages that the Purchasing Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
pro rata

(c) . In the event of any such termination, none of the parties will have any liability to the other parties hereto, except that (i) the Purchasing Agent shall be entitled to any commission earned in accordance with the second paragraph of Section 3(a) hereof, (ii) if at the time of

General
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture dated as of July 21, 1999, as amended or supplemented from time to time (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Citibank, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series of the Securities designated as Senior CoreNotes of the Company, which series is limited to an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000,000 or the equivalent thereof in one or more foreign or composite currencies minus the aggregate principal amount of the Company's Subordinated CoreNotes (referred to herein as the "corresponding series") which may be issued from time to time. Such limit may be increased by the Company without the consent of the Holders of the Securities of this series. The Securities of this series may mature at different times, bear interest, if any, at different rates, be redeemable at different times or not at all, be repayable at the option of the Holder at different times or not at all, be issued at an original issue discount and be denominated in different currencies.

Modification and Waivers; Obligation of the Company Absolute
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected, acting together as a class. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding affected by certain provisions of the Indenture, acting together as a class, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with those provisions of the Indenture. Certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences may be waived under the Indenture by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed, except that in the event the Company deposits money or Eligible Instruments as provided in Section 401 or 403 of the Indenture, such payments will be made only from proceeds of such money or Eligible Instruments.
 
Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance
 
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (a) the entire indebtedness on this Security and (b) certain restrictive covenants and certain Events of Default, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Security.
 
Redemption
 
If so provided on the face hereof, the Company may at its option redeem this Security in whole or from time to time in part in increments of $1,000 (provided that any remaining principal amount of this Security shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination hereof) on any Redemption Date specified on the face hereof at the Redemption Price specified on the face hereof, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date. The Company may exercise such option by causing the Trustee to mail a notice of such redemption at least 30 but not more than 60 days prior to the applicable Redemption Date to each Holder of the Securities of this series to be redeemed. In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, the Company shall issue a new Security or Securities for the unredeemed portion hereof in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. If less than all of the Securities of this series with like tenor and terms are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.
 
Sinking Fund
 
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, this Security will not be entitled to any sinking fund.
 
Repayment upon Exercise of Survivor's Option
 
Unless the face of this Security specifies that "Survivor's Option" shall not apply, the person (the "Authorized Representative") who has legal authority to act on behalf of the estate of a deceased [Holder of this Security] [owner of a beneficial interest in this Security] shall have the option to elect repayment of this Security in whole or in part in increments of U.S. $1,000 (provided that any remaining principal amount hereof shall be at least U.S. $1,000), following the death of such [Holder] [beneficial owner] (a "Survivor's Option"). No Survivor's Option may be exercised unless [this Security] [such beneficial interest] was purchased at least six months prior to the Authorized Representative's exercise of the Survivor's Option.
 
Pursuant to the valid exercise of the Survivor's Option, if applicable, the Company shall repay this Security (or portion thereof) at a price equal to 100% of the unpaid principal amount of this Security to be repaid, together with unpaid interest accrued hereon to the Repayment Date (as defined below), subject to the limitations in the next succeeding sentence. The Company may, in its sole discretion, (i) limit the aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and the corresponding series as to which all exercises of Survivor's Options with respect to all deceased Holders and owners of beneficial interests in all Securities of this series and the corresponding series will be accepted in any calendar year (the "Annual Put Limitation") to an amount equal to the greater of (A) 5% of the outstanding principal amount of all Securities of this series and the corresponding series outstanding as of the end of the most recent calendar year and (B) $5,000,000, and (ii) limit the aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and the corresponding series as to which all exercises of Survivor's Options with respect to any individual deceased Holder or owner of a beneficial interest in a Security of this series and/or the corresponding series will be accepted in any calendar year to $500,000 (the "Individual Put Limitation"), or, in the case of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), such greater principal amounts as the Company may determine for such calendar year.
 
Each election to exercise the Survivor's Option shall be accepted in the order in which all such elections are received, unless such acceptance would cause the aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and the corresponding series accepted for repayment to contravene the Annual Put Limitation or the Individual Put Limitation, if applied. If, as of the end of any calendar year, the aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and the corresponding series (or portions thereof) that has been tendered pursuant to valid exercises of Survivor's Options during such year has exceeded the Annual Put Limitation or the
 
Individual Put Limitation, if applied, for such year, any exercise(s) of the Survivor's Option with respect to Securities of this series and the corresponding series (or portions thereof) not accepted during such calendar year because such acceptance would have contravened any such limitations, if applied, shall be deemed to be received on the first day of the following calendar year in the order all such elections were originally received. Any Security (or portion thereof) accepted for repayment pursuant to a valid exercise of the Survivor's Option shall be repaid no earlier than the first Interest Payment Date to occur at least 20 calendar days after the date of such acceptance. In the event that a valid election to exercise the Survivor's Option is not accepted, the Paying Agent shall deliver a notice by first-class mail to the Holder of this Security at its last known address as indicated in the Security Register stating the reason therefor. An otherwise valid election to exercise the Survivor's Option may not be withdrawn.
 
If this Security is a Global Security, to obtain repayment pursuant to the exercise of the Survivor's Option with respect to a beneficial interest in this Security, the Authorized Representative must provide to the broker or other entity through which such beneficial interest is held by the deceased owner (i) a written request for repayment, substantially in the form of the attached "Repayment Election Form", signed by the Authorized Representative, and such signature must be guaranteed by a member firm of a registered national securities exchange or of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a commercial bank or trust company having an office or correspondent in the United States, (ii) appropriate evidence satisfactory to the Paying Agent that (A) the deceased was the owner of a beneficial interest in this Security at the time of death and that the deceased or the estate of the deceased has held such beneficial interest for at least six months prior to the date of exercise of the Survivor's Option, (B) the death of such beneficial owner has occurred on the specified date and (C) the Authorized Representative has authority to act on behalf of the deceased beneficial owner, (iii) if the beneficial interest in this Security is held by a nominee of the deceased beneficial owner, a certificate satisfactory to the Company and the Paying Agent from such nominee attesting to the deceased's ownership of a beneficial interest in this Security, (iv) tax waivers and such other instruments or documents that the Company or the Paying Agent reasonably requires in order to establish the validity of ownership of the beneficial interest in this Security and the Authorized Representative's entitlement to payment, (v) written instructions to such broker or other entity to notify the Depositary of the Authorized Representative's desire to obtain repayment pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option and (vi) any additional information the Company or the Paying Agent reasonably requires to document ownership or authority to make the election and to cause the repayment of this Security (or portion thereof). Such broker or other entity shall provide to the Paying Agent (A) the documents received from the Authorized Representative referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (vi) of the preceding sentence and (B) a certificate satisfactory to the Paying Agent from such broker or other entity stating that it represents the deceased beneficial owner. Such broker or other entity shall be responsible for disbursing any payments it receives pursuant to the exercise of the Survivor's Option to the such Authorized Representative.
 
If this Security is not a Global Security, in order for the Survivor's Option to be validly exercised with respect to this Security (or any portion hereof), the Paying Agent must receive from the Authorized Representative (i) a written request for repayment, substantially in the form of the attached "Repayment Election Form", signed by the Authorized Representative, and such signature must be guaranteed by a member firm of a registered national securities exchange or of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a commercial bank or trust company having an office or correspondent in the United States, (ii) tender of this Security (or portion hereof to be repaid), (iii) appropriate evidence satisfactory to the Paying Agent that (A) the deceased was the Holder of this Security at the time of death and that the deceased or the estate of the deceased has held this Security for at least six months prior to the date of exercise of the Survivor's Option, (B) the death of the Holder of this Security has occurred on the specified date and (C) the Authorized Representative has authority to act on behalf of the deceased Holder of this Security, (iv) if applicable, a properly executed assignment or endorsement, (v) if this Security is held by a nominee of the deceased beneficial owner, a certificate satisfactory to the Company and the Paying Agent from such nominee attesting to the deceased's ownership of a beneficial interest in this Security, (vi) tax waivers and such other instruments or documents that the Company or the Paying Agent reasonably requires in order to establish the validity of ownership of this Security and the Authorized Representative's entitlement to payment and (vii) any additional information the Company or the Paying Agent reasonably requires to document ownership or authority to make the election and to cause the repayment of this Security (or portion hereof).
 
Subject to the Company's right hereunder to limit the aggregate principal amount of this Security (or any portion hereof) as to which exercises of the Survivor's Option shall be accepted in any one calendar year, all questions as to the eligibility or validity of any exercise of the Survivor's Option will be determined by the Paying Agent, in its sole discretion. The Paying Agent's determination shall be final and binding.
 
The death of a person owning a Security of this series or beneficial interest therein in joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety with another person or persons shall be deemed to be the death of the Holder or beneficial owner, as the case may be, of such Security, and the entire principal amount of such Security or beneficial interest therein shall be eligible for repayment pursuant to the Survivor's Option. The death of a person owning a Security of this series or beneficial interest therein by tenancy in common shall be deemed to be the death of the Holder or beneficial owner, as the case may be, of such Security only to the extent of the interest of the deceased Holder or beneficial owner in such Security unless such Security or beneficial interest therein is held by husband and wife as tenants in common, in which case, the death of either spouse shall be deemed to be the death of the Holder or beneficial owner, as the case may be, of such Security, and the entire principal amount of such Security or beneficial interest therein shall be eligible for repayment pursuant to the Survivor's Option.
 
The death of a person who, during his or her lifetime, was entitled to substantially all of the interests of beneficial ownership of a Security of this series shall be deemed to be the death of the Holder or beneficial owner, as the case may be, of such Security if such interests can be established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent.
 
In the event of repayment of this Security in part only, a new Security of like tenor in a principal amount equal to the unrepaid portion of principal hereof and otherwise having the same terms and provisions as this Security shall be issued by the Company in the name of the Holder hereof upon the presentation and surrender hereof. As used herein, the term "Repayment Date" shall mean the date fixed for repayment in accordance with the repayment provisions specified above.
 
Authorized Denominations
 
Unless otherwise provided on the face hereof, this Security is issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 or any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000.
 
Registration of Transfer
 
Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Security at the corporate trust office of the Trustee in the City of New York or at the corporate trust office of the Paying Agent in Minneapolis, Minnesota, a new Security or Securities of this series in authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange herefor, as provided in the Indenture and subject to the limitations provided therein and to the limitations described below, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
 
If this Security is a Global Security (as specified above), this Security is exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form only if (x) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Security or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Company does not appoint a successor Depositary within 90 days after receiving such notice or after becoming aware that the Depositary has ceased to be so registered as a clearing agency, (y) the Company in its sole discretion determines that this Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form and notifies the Trustee thereof or (z) an Event of Default with respect to the Securities represented hereby has occurred and is continuing. If this Security is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form, bearing interest at the same rate, having the same date of issuance, redemption provisions, Stated Maturity Date and other terms and of authorized denominations aggregating a like amount.
 
If this Security is a Global Security (as specified above), this Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor of the Depositary or a nominee of such successor. Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this Global Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form and will not be considered the Holders hereof for any purpose under the Indenture.
 
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
No Personal Recourse
 
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.

General
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture dated as of August 30, 1999, as amended or supplemented from time to time (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Bank One Trust Company, N.A. (successor in interest to The First National Bank of Chicago), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series of the Securities designated as Subordinated CoreNotes of the Company, which series is limited to an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000,000 or the equivalent thereof in one or more foreign or composite currencies minus the aggregate principal amount of the Company's Senior CoreNotes (referred to herein as the "corresponding series") which may be issued from time to time. Such limit may be increased by the Company without the consent of the Holders of the Securities of this series. The Securities of this series may mature at different times, bear interest, if any, at different rates, be redeemable at different times or not at all, be repayable at the option of the Holder at different times or not at all, be issued at an original issue discount and be denominated in different currencies.
 
The Securities are issuable only in registered form without coupons and will be either (a) book-entry securities represented by one or more global securities recorded in the book-entry system maintained by the Depository or (b) certificated securities issued to and registered in the names of, the beneficial owners or their nominees.
 
The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture, subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on all Senior Debt of the Company, and the Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, agrees to and shall be bound by the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto.

Events of Default
 
If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
Modification and Waivers; Obligation of the Company Absolute
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected, acting together as a class. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding affected by certain provisions of the Indenture, acting together as a class, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with those provisions of the Indenture. Certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences may be waived under the Indenture by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
Subject to the rights of holders of Senior Debt of the Company set forth in this Security and the Indenture referred to above, no reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed, except that in the event the Company deposits money or Eligible Instruments as provided in Section 401 or 403 of the Indenture, such payments will be made only from proceeds of such money or Eligible Instruments.
 
Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance
 
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (a) the entire indebtedness on this Security and (b) certain restrictive covenants and certain Events of Default, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Security.
 
Redemption
 
If so provided on the face hereof, the Company may at its option redeem this Security in whole or from time to time in part in increments of $1,000 (provided that any remaining principal amount of this Security shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination
 
hereof) on any Redemption Date specified on the face hereof at the Redemption Price specified on the face hereof, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date. The Company may exercise such option by causing the Trustee to mail a notice of such redemption at least 30 but not more than 60 days prior to the applicable Redemption Date to each Holder of the Securities of this series to be redeemed. In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, the Company shall issue a new Security or Securities for the unredeemed portion hereof in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. If less than all of the Securities of this series with like tenor and terms are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.
 
Sinking Fund
 
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, this Security will not be entitled to any sinking fund.
 
Repayment upon Exercise of Survivor's Option
 
Unless the face of this Security specifies that "Survivor's Option" shall not apply, the person (the "Authorized Representative") who has legal authority to act on behalf of the estate of a deceased [Holder of this Security] [owner of a beneficial interest in this Security] shall have the option to elect repayment of this Security in whole or in part in increments of U.S. $1,000 (provided that any remaining principal amount hereof shall be at least U.S. $1,000), following the death of such [Holder] [beneficial owner] (a "Survivor's Option"). No Survivor's Option may be exercised unless [this Security] [such beneficial interest] was purchased at least six months prior to the Authorized Representative's exercise of the Survivor's Option.
 
Pursuant to the valid exercise of the Survivor's Option, if applicable, the Company shall repay this Security (or portion thereof) at a price equal to 100% of the unpaid principal amount of this Security to be repaid, together with unpaid interest accrued hereon to the Repayment Date (as defined below), subject to the limitations in the next succeeding sentence. The Company may, in its sole discretion, (i) limit the aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and the corresponding series as to which all exercises of Survivor's Options with respect to all deceased Holders and owners of beneficial interests in all Securities of this series and the corresponding series will be accepted in any calendar year (the "Annual Put Limitation") to an amount equal to the greater of (A) 5% of the outstanding principal amount of all Securities of this series and the corresponding series outstanding as of the end of the most recent calendar year and (B) $5,000,000, and (ii) limit the aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and the corresponding series as to which all exercises of Survivor's Options with respect to any individual deceased Holder or owner of a beneficial interest in a Security of this series and/or the corresponding series will be accepted in any calendar year to $500,000 (the "Individual Put Limitation"), or, in the case of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), such greater principal amounts as the Company may determine for such calendar year.
 
Each election to exercise the Survivor's Option shall be accepted in the order in which all such elections are received, unless such acceptance would cause the aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and the corresponding series accepted for repayment to contravene the Annual Put Limitation or the Individual Put Limitation, if applied. If, as of the end of any calendar year, the aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and the corresponding series (or portions thereof) that has been tendered pursuant to valid exercises of Survivor's Options during such year has exceeded the Annual Put Limitation or the Individual Put Limitation, if applied, for such year, any exercise(s) of the Survivor's Option with respect to Securities of this series and the corresponding series (or portions thereof) not accepted during such calendar year because such acceptance would have contravened any such limitations, if applied, shall be deemed to be received on the first day of the following calendar year in the order all such elections were originally received. Any Security (or portion thereof) accepted for repayment pursuant to a valid exercise of the Survivor's Option shall be repaid no earlier than the first Interest Payment Date to occur at least 20 calendar days after the date of such acceptance. In the event that a valid election to exercise the Survivor's Option is not accepted, the Paying Agent shall deliver a notice by first-class mail to the Holder of this Security at its last known address as indicated in the Security Register stating the reason therefor. An otherwise valid election to exercise the Survivor's Option may not be withdrawn.
 
If this Security is a Global Security, to obtain repayment pursuant to the exercise of the Survivor's Option with respect to a beneficial interest in this Security, the Authorized Representative must provide to the broker or other entity through which such beneficial interest is held by the deceased owner (i) a written request for repayment, substantially in the form of the attached "Repayment Election Form", signed by the Authorized Representative, and such signature must be guaranteed by a member firm of a registered national securities exchange or of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a commercial bank or trust company having an office or correspondent in the United States, (ii) appropriate evidence satisfactory to the Paying Agent that (A) the deceased was the owner of a beneficial interest in this Security at the time of death and that the deceased or the estate of the deceased has held such beneficial interest for at least six months prior to the date of exercise of the Survivor's Option, (B) the death of such beneficial owner has occurred on the specified date and (C) the Authorized Representative has authority to act on behalf of the deceased beneficial owner, (iii) if the beneficial interest in this Security is held by a nominee of the deceased beneficial owner, a certificate satisfactory to the Company and the Paying Agent from such nominee attesting to the deceased's ownership of a beneficial interest in this Security, (iv) tax waivers and such other instruments or documents that the Company or the Paying Agent reasonably requires in order to establish the validity of ownership of the beneficial interest in this Security and the Authorized Representative's entitlement to payment, (v) written instructions to such broker or other entity to notify the Depositary of the Authorized Representative's desire to obtain repayment pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option and (vi) any additional information the Company or the Paying Agent reasonably requires to document ownership or authority to make the election and to cause the repayment of this Security (or portion thereof). Such broker or other entity shall provide to the Paying Agent (A) the documents received from the Authorized Representative referred to in clauses
 
(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (vi) of the preceding sentence and (B) a certificate satisfactory to the Paying Agent from such broker or other entity stating that it represents the deceased beneficial owner. Such broker or other entity shall be responsible for disbursing any payments it receives pursuant to the exercise of the Survivor's Option to the such Authorized Representative.
 
If this Security is not a Global Security, in order for the Survivor's Option to be validly exercised with respect to this Security (or any portion hereof), the Paying Agent must receive from the Authorized Representative (i) a written request for repayment, substantially in the form of the attached "Repayment Election Form", signed by the Authorized Representative, and such signature must be guaranteed by a member firm of a registered national securities exchange or of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a commercial bank or trust company having an office or correspondent in the United States, (ii) tender of this Security (or portion hereof to be repaid), (iii) appropriate evidence satisfactory to the Paying Agent that (A) the deceased was the Holder of this Security at the time of death and that the deceased or the estate of the deceased has held this Security for at least six months prior to the date of exercise of the Survivor's Option, (B) the death of the Holder of this Security has occurred on the specified date and (C) the Authorized Representative has authority to act on behalf of the deceased Holder of this Security, (iv) if applicable, a properly executed assignment or endorsement, (v) if this Security is held by a nominee of the deceased beneficial owner, a certificate satisfactory to the Company and the Paying Agent from such nominee attesting to the deceased's ownership of a beneficial interest in this Security, (vi) tax waivers and such other instruments or documents that the Company or the Paying Agent reasonably requires in order to establish the validity of ownership of this Security and the Authorized Representative's entitlement to payment and (vii) any additional information the Company or the Paying Agent reasonably requires to document ownership or authority to make the election and to cause the repayment of this Security (or portion hereof).
 
Subject to the Company's right hereunder to limit the aggregate principal amount of this Security (or any portion hereof) as to which exercises of the Survivor's Option shall be accepted in any one calendar year, all questions as to the eligibility or validity of any exercise of the Survivor's Option will be determined by the Paying Agent, in its sole discretion. The Paying Agent's determination shall be final and binding.
 
The death of a person owning a Security of this series or beneficial interest therein in joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety with another person or persons shall be deemed to be the death of the Holder or beneficial owner, as the case may be, of such Security, and the entire principal amount of such Security or beneficial interest therein shall be eligible for repayment pursuant to the Survivor's Option. The death of a person owning a Security of this series or beneficial interest therein by tenancy in common shall be deemed to be the death of the Holder or beneficial owner, as the case may be, of such Security only to the extent of the interest of the deceased Holder or beneficial owner in such Security unless such Security or beneficial interest therein is held by husband and wife as tenants in common, in which case, the death of either spouse shall be deemed to be the death of the Holder or beneficial owner, as the case may be, of such Security, and the entire principal amount of such Security or beneficial interest therein shall be eligible for repayment pursuant to the Survivor's Option.
 
The death of a person who, during his or her lifetime, was entitled to substantially all of the interests of beneficial ownership of a Security of this series shall be deemed to be the death of the Holder or beneficial owner, as the case may be, of such Security if such interests can be established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent.
 
In the event of repayment of this Security in part only, a new Security of like tenor in a principal amount equal to the unrepaid portion of principal hereof and otherwise having the same terms and provisions as this Security shall be issued by the Company in the name of the Holder hereof upon the presentation and surrender hereof. As used herein, the term "Repayment Date" shall mean the date fixed for repayment in accordance with the repayment provisions specified above.
 
Authorized Denominations
 
Unless otherwise provided on the face hereof, this Security is issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 or any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000.
 
Registration of Transfer
 
Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Security at the corporate trust office of the Trustee in the City of New York or at the corporate trust office of the Paying Agent in Minneapolis, Minnesota, a new Security or Securities of this series in authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange herefor, as provided in the Indenture and subject to the limitations provided therein and to the limitations described below, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
 
If this Security is a Global Security (as specified above), this Security is exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form only if (x) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Security or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Company does not appoint a successor Depositary within 90 days after receiving such notice or after becoming aware that the Depositary has ceased to be so registered as a clearing agency, (y) the Company in its sole discretion determines that this Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form and notifies the Trustee thereof or (z) an Event of Default with respect to the Securities represented hereby has occurred and is continuing. If this Security is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form, bearing interest at the same rate, having the same date of issuance, redemption provisions, Stated Maturity Date and other terms and of authorized denominations aggregating a like amount.
 
If this Security is a Global Security (as specified above), this Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor of the Depositary or a nominee of such successor. Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this Global Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form and will not be considered the Holders hereof for any purpose under the Indenture.
 
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
No Personal Recourse
 
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.
 
Defined Terms
 
All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
