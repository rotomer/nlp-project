Under the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Guarantor shall pay, under certain circumstances, certain expenses of the Trust. 1. Representations and Warranties. Each of the Trust and the Guarantor jointly and severally represent and warrant to, and agree with, each Underwriter that: (a) The Trust and the Guarantor meet the requirements for use of Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") and have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on such Form (the file number of which is set forth in Schedule I hereto), which has become effective, for the registration under the Act of the Capital Securities, the Guarantee and the Debentures. The Trust and the Guarantor propose to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act a supplement to the form of prospectus included in such registration statement relating to the Capital Securities, the Guarantee and the Debentures in substantially the form heretofore delivered to you. Such registration statement, including all exhibits thereto (but excluding Form T-1), as amended at the date of this Agreement, is hereinafter called the "Registration Statement"; such prospectus relating to the Capital Securities, the Guarantee and the Debentures in the form in which it appears in the Registration Statement is hereinafter called the "Basic Prospectus" and such supplemented form of prospectus, in the form in which it shall be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) (including the Basic Prospectus as so supplemented) is hereinafter called the "Final Prospectus". Any preliminary form of the Final Prospectus which has heretofore been filed pursuant to Rule 424 is hereinafter called the "Preliminary Final Prospectus". Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") on or before the date of this Agreement, or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference herein to the terms "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the date of this Agreement, or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be, and deemed to be incorporated therein by reference. (b) As of the date hereof, when the Final Prospectus is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act, when, prior to the Closing Date (as 2
hereinafter defined), any amendment to the Registration Statement becomes effective (including the filing of any document incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement), when any supplement to the Final Prospectus is filed with the Commission and at the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), (i) the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such time, and the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of any such time, the Indenture, the Trust Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement will comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the "Trust Indenture Act"), and the Exchange Act and the respective rules thereunder and (ii) neither the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such time, nor the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of any such time, will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that the Trust and the Guarantor make no representations or warranties as to (i) that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statements of Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Debenture Trustee, the Guarantee Trustee and the Property Trustee, or (ii) the information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Trust or the Guarantor by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for use in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of such information described as such in a letter dated the Closing Date the ("Blood Letter") delivered by the Representative to the Company). 2. Purchase and Sale. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Trust agrees to sell to each Underwriter, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Trust, the number of the Capital Securities set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in Schedule II hereto at a purchase price of $25 (the "Purchase Price") per Capital Security, plus any accumulated distributions thereon. (b) In consideration of such purchases on the Closing Date, the proceeds of which will be used to purchase the Debentures, the Guarantor shall pay to the Underwriters as compensation, in immediately available funds, on the Closing Date $0.7875 per Capital Security, or an aggregate of $15,750,000 3. Delivery and Payment. Delivery of and payment for the Capital Securities shall be made at the office, on the date and at the time specified in Schedule I hereto, which date and time may be postponed by agreement among the Representative, the Trust and the Guarantor or as provided in Section 8 hereof (such date and time of delivery and payment for the Capital Securities being herein called the "Closing Date"). Delivery of the Capital Securities shall be made to the Representative for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters against payment by the several Underwriters through the Representative of the purchase price thereof in 3
the manner set forth in Schedule I hereto. The Trust will deliver against payment of the purchase price the Capital Securities in the form of one or more permanent global securities in definitive form deposited with or on behalf of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as custodian for The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") for credit to the respective accounts of the Underwriters and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC. Interests in the permanent global Capital Securities will be held only in book-entry form through DTC, except in the limited circumstances described in the Final Prospectus. 4. Agreements. The Trust and the Guarantor jointly and severally agree with the several Underwriters that: (a) The Trust or the Guarantor will provide to counsel for the Underwriters one manually executed copy of the Registration Statement, including all exhibits thereto, in the form it became effective and all amendments thereto. Prior to the Closing Date, the Trust and the Guarantor will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement (including the Final Prospectus) to the Basic Prospectus unless the Trust or the Guarantor has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object promptly after notice thereof. Neither the Representative's consent to, nor the Underwriters' delivery of, any such amendment or supplement shall constitute a waiver of any of the conditions set forth in Section 5 hereof. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Trust and the Guarantor will cause the Final Prospectus to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than the close of business on the second business day following the execution and delivery of this Agreement. The Trust and the Guarantor will promptly advise the Representative (i) when the Final Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), (ii) when any amendment to the Registration Statement relating to the Capital Securities, the Guarantee and the Debentures shall have become effective, (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or amendment of or supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) of the receipt by the Trust or the Guarantor of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Capital Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. In the event of the issuance of any stop order preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary Final Prospectus or Final Prospectus, the Trust and the Guarantor will use promptly their best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such stop order. (b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Capital Securities, the Guarantee and the Debentures is required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be 4
necessary to amend or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Trust or the Guarantor will promptly notify you and, upon your request, the Trust and the Guarantor will prepare and file with the Commission an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance. Neither the Representative's request for, nor the Underwriters' delivery of, any such amendment or supplement shall constitute a waiver of any of the conditions set forth in Section 5 hereof. (c) As soon as practicable, the Guarantor, on behalf of the Trust, will make generally available to the Trust's security holders an earnings statement or statements of the Guarantor and the Guarantor's subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act. (d) The Trust and the Guarantor will furnish to the Representative and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and each amendment thereto which shall become effective on or prior to the Closing Date and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act, as many copies of any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto as the Representative may reasonably request. The Guarantor will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering and the expenses incurred in distributing the Final Prospectus to the Underwriters. (e) The Trust and the Guarantor will arrange for the qualification of the Capital Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representative may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required to complete the distribution of the Capital Securities; provided, however, that each of the Trust and the Guarantor shall not be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject or subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject. (f) Until the business day following the Closing Date or such earlier time as you may notify the Trust or the Guarantor, neither the Trust nor the Guarantor will, without the consent of the Representative, offer or sell, or announce the offering of, any securities (other than commercial paper) that are substantially similar to the Capital Securities and are covered by the Registration Statement or any other registration statement filed under the Act. (g) The Trust and the Guarantor agree to use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Capital Securities on the New York Stock Exchange until such time as none of the Capital Securities are outstanding. If the Capital Securities cease to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the Trust and the Guarantor agree to use all commercially 5
reasonable efforts promptly to list the Capital Securities on a stock exchange agreed upon by the Trust, the Guarantor and the Representative. The Trust and the Guarantor will use all commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange and will otherwise comply with any undertakings given by it from time to time to the New York Stock Exchange in connection with the Capital Securities listed thereon or the listing thereof and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, to furnish or cause to be furnished to the New York Stock Exchange all such information as it may require in connection with the listing thereon of the Capital Securities. In the event that the Debentures are distributed to the holders of the Capital Securities, the Trust and the Guarantor agree to use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Debentures on the New York Stock Exchange or any other stock exchange on which the Capital Securities are then listed until such time as none of the Debentures are outstanding. (h) The Guarantor will pay all expenses incident to the performance of the Trust's and its obligations under this Agreement, for any filing fees or other expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) in connection with qualification of the Capital Securities for sale and determination of their eligibility for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representative may designate and the printing of memoranda relating thereto, for any fees charged by investment rating agencies for the rating of the Capital Securities and the Debentures, for any applicable filing fee incident to, and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with, the review by the New York Stock Exchange of the Capital Securities, for any travel expenses of the Trust's and the Guarantor's officers and employees and any other expenses of the Trust and the Guarantor in connection with attending or hosting meetings with prospective purchasers of Capital Securities and for expenses incurred in distributing any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus. The Guarantor will also pay all fees and expenses of the Debenture Trustee, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Debenture Trustee in connection with the Indenture and the Debentures; the fees and expenses of the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee in connection with the Certificate of Trust filed with the Delaware Secretary of State with respect to the Trust (the "Certificate of Trust") and the Trust Agreement; and the fees and expenses of the Guarantee Trustee, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Guarantee Trustee in connection with the Guarantee and the Guarantee Agreement.

(iii) with respect to the certificate delivered by the Guarantor, since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Final Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, earnings, business, properties or business prospects of the Trust and the Guarantor and the Guarantor's subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus. (g) At the Closing Date, KPMG LLP shall have furnished to the Representative a letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to the Representative), dated the Closing Date. (h) As of the Closing Date, there shall not have occurred since the date hereof any change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business, properties, results of operations or business prospects of the Trust, the Guarantor and the Guarantor's subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from that set forth in the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of the date hereof, that, in the judgment of the Representative, is material and adverse and that makes it, in the judgment of the Representative, impracticable to market the Capital Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Final Prospectus, as so amended or supplemented. (i) As of the Closing Date, the Capital Securities shall have been approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange or on such other stock exchange agreed upon by the Trust, the Guarantor and the Representative, unless the failure to obtain such approval is a result of the Underwriters' failure to provide any materials requested by such exchange. If (i) any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled when and as provided in this Agreement, or (ii) any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representative and its counsel, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be cancelled on, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representative. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Trust and the Guarantor in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing. 6. Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses. If the sale of the Capital Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 5 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Trust and the Guarantor to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Guarantor will reimburse the Underwriters severally upon demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and those described in Section 4(h) hereof) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Capital Securities. 14
7. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Trust and the Guarantor jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement for the registration of the Capital Securities, the Guarantee and the Debentures as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party to the extent set forth below, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that (i) the Trust and the Guarantor will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Trust or the Guarantor by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for use therein (it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of such information described as such in the Blood Letter); and (ii) with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from the Basic Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection (a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter (or any person controlling such Underwriter) from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased the Capital Securities concerned, to the extent that the Final Prospectus relating to such Capital Securities was required to be delivered by such Underwriter under the Act in connection with such purchase and was not so delivered within the time required by the Act and the rules thereunder and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the Basic Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus was corrected in the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented if the Trust or the Guarantor had previously furnished copies of the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented (exclusive of material incorporated by reference) to such Underwriter. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Trust or the Guarantor may otherwise have. (b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Trust, the Administrative Trustees, the Guarantor, each of their directors, each of the Guarantor's officers and the Trust's representative who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Trust or the Guarantor within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the 15
Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Trust and the Guarantor to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Trust or the Guarantor by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representative for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity (it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of such information described as such in the Blood Letter). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental investigation), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it shall wish, jointly, with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party). In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to obtain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts of interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate identified firm (in addition to any identified local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representative that is an indemnified party in the case of parties to be indemnified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 7 and by the Guarantor in the case of parties to be indemnified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 7. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its prior written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is a party and indemnity 16
could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of the indemnified party. (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 7(a) or 7(b) hereof is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Trust and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and each Underwriter, on the other hand, from the offering of such Capital Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Trust and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and each Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Trust and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and each Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of such Capital Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Capital Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Trust bear to the total discounts and commissions received by each Underwriter in respect thereof. The relative fault of the Trust and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and each Underwriter, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Trust and the Guarantor or by such Underwriter and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. Each Underwriter's obligation to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 shall be several in the proportion that the number of Capital Securities the sale of which by such Underwriter gave rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities bears to the aggregate number of Capital Securities the sale of which by all Underwriters gave rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, and not joint. (e) The Trust and the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to Section 7(d) hereof were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d) hereof. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 7(d) hereof shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses 17
reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Capital Securities referred to in Section 7(d) hereof that were offered and sold to the public through such Underwriter exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 8. Default by an Underwriter. If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Capital Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the number of Capital Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bear to the aggregate number of Capital Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Capital Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate number of Capital Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate number of Capital Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of such Capital Securities; provided further, that if the remaining Underwriters do not exercise their right to purchase such Capital Securities and arrangements for the purchase of such Capital Securities satisfactory to the Trust and the Guarantor and the Representative are not made within 36 hours after such default, then this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter, the Trust and the Guarantor. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representative shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Trust or the Guarantor and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. 9. Underwriter Representations and Agreements. In the event that the offer or sale of the Capital Securities by an Underwriter in a jurisdiction requires any action on the part of the Trust or the Guarantor in or with respect to such jurisdiction, such Underwriter represents and agrees that it will (i) inform the Trust or the Guarantor that the Trust or the Guarantor is required to take such action prior to the time such action is required to be taken, and (ii) cooperate with and assist the Trust or the Guarantor in complying with such requirements. Each Underwriter severally represents and agrees that it has not offered or sold, and will not offer or sell, the Capital Securities in any member state of the European Union. Each Underwriter severally agrees that it will, to the best of its knowledge and belief, comply with all applicable securities laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction in which it purchases, offers, sells or delivers the Capital Securities or possesses or distributes any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, and will obtain any required consent, approval or permission for its purchase, offer, sale or delivery of the Capital Securities under the laws and regulations in force in any 18
jurisdiction to which it is subject or in which it makes any such purchases, offers, sales or deliveries. Each Underwriter severally agrees that it will provide any materials requested by the New York Stock Exchange or such other stock exchange upon which the Capital Securities, or, if applicable, the Debentures, are listed. Each Underwriter also severally agrees that it will timely file with the Corporate Financing Department of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "Association") any documents required to be filed under Rules 2710 and 2720 of the Association's Conduct Rules relating to the offering of the Capital Securities. 10. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representative, by notice given to the Trust and the Guarantor prior to delivery of and payment for the Capital Securities, if prior to such time there shall have occurred any (i) suspension or material limitation of trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange or a material disruption in settlement services in the United States, (ii) suspension of trading of any securities of the Guarantor on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) declaration of a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in California or New York by either Federal or state authorities, (iv) lowering of the rating assigned to any debt securities of the Guarantor by any nationally-recognized securities rating agency or public announcement by any such rating agency that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative consequences, its rating of any debt securities of the Guarantor or (v) outbreak or escalation of hostilities in which the United States is involved, declaration of war by Congress or change in financial markets or calamity or crisis including, without limitation, an act of terrorism that, in the judgment of the Representative, is material and adverse and, in the case of any of the events described in clauses (i) through (v), such event, either alone or together with any other such event, makes it, in the judgment of the Representative, impracticable to proceed with completion of the public offering of, or sale of and payment for, the Capital Securities. 11. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Trust, the Guarantor or their officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Trust or the Guarantor or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Capital Securities. The provisions of Sections 6 and 7 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement. 12. Notices. Unless otherwise provided herein, all notices required under the terms and provisions hereof shall be in writing, either delivered by hand, by mail or by facsimile, telex, telecopier, or telegram and confirmed to the recipient, and any such notice shall be effective when received if sent to the Representative, at the address specified in Schedule I hereto, or if sent to the Trust, at Wells Fargo Center, MAC: N9305-173, Sixth Street and Marquette Avenue, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55479 or to the Guarantor, at 444 Market Street, MAC: 0195-171, San Francisco, California, 94111. 13. Successors. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder. 19
14. Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. 15. Business Day. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is normally open for business. 20

AMENDED AND RESTATED DECLARATION OF TRUST AND TRUST AGREEMENT, dated as of April 8, 2004 among (i) Wells Fargo & Company, a Delaware corporation (including any successors or assigns, the "Depositor"), (ii) J.P.

(c) In connection with the issuance and sale of the Capital Securities, the Depositor shall have the right and responsibility to assist the Issuer Trust with respect to, or effect on behalf of the Issuer Trust, the following (and any actions taken by the Depositor in furtherance of the following prior to the date of this Trust Agreement are hereby ratified and confirmed in all respects): (i) the preparation and filing by the Issuer Trust with the Commission of and the execution on behalf of the Issuer Trust of a registration statement on the appropriate form in relation to the Capital Securities, including any amendments thereto; (ii) the determination of the states in which to take appropriate action to qualify or register for sale all or part of the Capital Securities and the determination of any and all such acts, other than actions that must be taken by or on behalf of the Issuer Trust, and the advice to the Issuer Trust of actions they must take on behalf of the Issuer Trust, and the preparation for execution and filing of any documents to be executed and 14

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Administrative Trustees are authorized and directed to conduct the affairs of the Issuer Trust and to operate the Issuer Trust so that the Issuer Trust will not be deemed to be an "investment company" required to be registered under the Investment Company Act, and will not be taxable as a corporation or classified as other than a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes and so that the Debentures will be treated as indebtedness of the Depositor for United States Federal income tax purposes. In this connection, the Depositor and the Administrative Trustees are authorized to take any action, not inconsistent with applicable law, the Certificate of Trust or this Trust Agreement, that they determine in their discretion to be necessary or desirable for such purposes, as long as such action does not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of the Holders of the Outstanding Capital Securities. In no event shall the Depositor or the Issuer Trustees be liable to the Issuer Trust or the Holders for any failure to comply with this section that results from a change in law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof. SECTION 2.8. Assets of Trust. The assets of the Issuer Trust shall consist solely of the Trust Property. SECTION 2.9. Title to Trust Property. Legal title to all Trust Property shall be vested at all times in the Property Trustee (in its capacity as such) and shall be held and administered by the Property Trustee in trust for the benefit of the Issuer Trust and the Holders in accordance with this Trust Agreement. ARTICLE 3 PAYMENT ACCOUNT SECTION 3.1. Payment Account. (a) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Property Trustee shall establish the Payment Account. The Property Trustee and its agents shall have exclusive control and sole right of withdrawal with respect to the Payment Account for the purpose of making deposits in and 15
withdrawals from the Payment Account in accordance with this Trust Agreement. All monies and other property deposited or held from time to time in the Payment Account shall be held by the Property Trustee in the Payment Account for the exclusive benefit of the Holders and for distribution as herein provided, including (and subject to) any priority of payments provided for herein. (b) The Property Trustee shall deposit in the Payment Account, promptly upon receipt, all payments of principal of or interest on, and any other payments or proceeds with respect to, the Debentures. Amounts held in the Payment Account shall not be invested by the Property Trustee pending distribution thereof. ARTICLE 4 DISTRIBUTIONS; REDEMPTION SECTION 4.1. Distributions. (a) The Trust Securities represent undivided beneficial interests in the Trust Property, and Distributions (including of Additional Amounts) will be made on the Trust Securities at the rate and on the dates that payments of interest (including Additional Interest, as defined in the Indenture) are made on the Debentures. Accordingly: (i) Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be cumulative, and will accumulate whether or not there are funds of the Trust available for the payment of Distributions. Distributions shall accumulate from April 8, 2004 and, except in the event (and to the extent) that the Depositor exercises its right to defer the payment of interest on the Debentures pursuant to the Indenture, shall be payable quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing on July 1, 2004. If any date on which a Distribution is otherwise payable on the Trust Securities is not a Business Day, then the payment of such Distribution shall be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), with the same force and effect as if made on the date on which such payment was originally payable (each date on which distributions are payable in accordance with this Section 4.1(a), a "Distribution Date"). (ii) In the event (and to the extent) that the Depositor exercises its right under the Indenture to defer the payment of interest on the Debentures, Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be deferred but shall continue to accumulate. Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be payable at a rate of 5.625% per annum of the Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities. The amount of Distributions payable for any full quarterly period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The amount of Distributions for any partial period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The amount of Distributions payable for any period shall include the Additional Amounts, if any. (iii) Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be made by the Property Trustee from the Payment Account and shall be payable on each Distribution Date only to the 16
extent that the Issuer Trust has funds then on hand and available in the Payment Account for the payment of such Distributions. (b) Distributions on the Trust Securities with respect to a Distribution Date shall be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities at the close of business on the relevant record date for such Distribution Date, which shall be the 15/th/ calendar day, whether or not a Business Day, before the relevant Distribution Date. Distributions payable on any Trust Securities that are not punctually paid on any Distribution Date will cease to be payable to the Person in whose name such Trust Securities are registered on the relevant record date, and such defaulted Distribution will instead be payable to the Person in whose name such Trust Securities are registered on the special record date or other specified date for determining Holders entitled to such defaulted interest established in accordance with the Indenture. SECTION 4.2. Redemption. (a) On each Debenture Redemption Date and on the stated maturity of the Debentures, the Issuer Trust will be required to redeem a Like Amount of Trust Securities at the Redemption Price. (b) Notice of redemption shall be given by the Property Trustee by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date to each Holder of Trust Securities to be redeemed, at such Holder's address appearing in the Security Register. All notices of redemption shall state: (i) the Redemption Date; (ii) the Redemption Price or if the Redemption Price cannot be calculated prior to the time the notice is required to be sent, the estimate of the Redemption Price together with a statement that it is an estimate and that the actual Redemption Price will be calculated on the third Business Day prior to the Redemption Date (and if an estimate is provided, a further notice shall be sent of the actual Redemption Price on the date that such Redemption Price is calculated); (iii) the CUSIP number or CUSIP numbers of the Capital Securities affected; (iv) if less than all the Outstanding Trust Securities are to be redeemed, the identification and the aggregate Liquidation Amount of the particular Trust Securities to be redeemed; (v) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Trust Security to be redeemed and that Distributions thereon will cease to accumulate on and after said date, except as provided in Section 4.2(d) below; and (vi) if the Capital Securities are no longer in book-entry-only form, the place or places where the Capital Securities Certificates are to be surrendered for the payment of the Redemption Price. 17
(c) The Trust Securities redeemed on each Redemption Date shall be redeemed at the Redemption Price with the proceeds from the contemporaneous redemption or payment at stated maturity of the Debentures. Redemptions of the Trust Securities shall be made and the Redemption Price shall be payable on each Redemption Date only to the extent that the Issuer Trust has funds then on hand and available in the Payment Account for the payment of such Redemption Price. (d) If the Property Trustee gives a notice of redemption in respect of any Capital Securities, then, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Redemption Date, subject to Section 4.2(c), the Property Trustee will, with respect to Book-Entry Capital Securities, irrevocably deposit with the Clearing Agency for such Book-Entry Capital Securities, to the extent available therefor, funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price and will give such Clearing Agency irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Capital Securities. With respect to Capital Securities that are not Book-Entry Capital Securities, the Property Trustee, subject to Section 4.2(c), will irrevocably deposit with the Paying Agent, to the extent available therefor, funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price and will give the Paying Agent irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Capital Securities upon surrender of their Capital Securities Certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributions payable on or prior to the Redemption Date for any Trust Securities called for redemption shall be payable to the Holders of such Trust Securities as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities on the relevant record dates for the related Distribution Dates. If notice of redemption shall have been given and funds deposited as required, then upon the date of such deposit, all rights of Holders holding Trust Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of such Holders to receive the Redemption Price and any Distribution payable in respect of the Trust Securities on or prior to the Redemption Date, but without interest, and such Trust Securities will cease to be outstanding. In the event that any date on which any Redemption Price is payable is not a Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), with the same force and effect as if made on such date. In the event that payment of the Redemption Price in respect of any Trust Securities called for redemption is improperly withheld or refused and not paid either by the Issuer Trust or by the Depositor pursuant to the Guarantee, Distributions on such Trust Securities will continue to accumulate, as set forth in Section 4.1, from the Redemption Date originally established by the Issuer Trust for such Trust Securities to the date such Redemption Price is actually paid, in which case the actual payment date will be the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the Redemption Price. (e) Subject to Section 4.3(a), if less than all the Outstanding Trust Securities are to be redeemed on a Redemption Date, then the aggregate Liquidation Amount of Trust Securities to be redeemed shall be allocated pro rata to the Common Securities and the Capital Securities based upon the relative Liquidation Amounts of such classes. The particular Capital Securities to be redeemed shall be selected on a pro rata basis based upon their respective Liquidation Amounts not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Property Trustee from the Outstanding Capital Securities not previously called for redemption by any method the Property Trustee deems fair and appropriate, provided that so long as the Capital Securities are in book-entry-only form, such selection shall be made in accordance with the customary procedures 18
for the Clearing Agency for the Capital Securities. The Property Trustee shall promptly notify the Securities Registrar in writing of the Capital Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Capital Securities selected for partial redemption, the Liquidation Amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Trust Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Capital Securities shall relate, in the case of any Capital Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the aggregate Liquidation Amount of Capital Securities that has been or is to be redeemed. SECTION 4.3. Ranking of Common Securities. (a) Payment of Distributions (including any Additional Amounts) on, the Redemption Price of, and the Liquidation Distribution in respect of, the Trust Securities, as applicable, shall be made, subject to Section 4.2(e), pro rata among the Common Securities and the Capital Securities based on the Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities; provided, however, that if on any Distribution Date, Redemption Date or Liquidation Date any Event of Default resulting from a Debenture Event of Default specified in Section 501(1) or 501(2) of the Indenture shall have occurred and be continuing, no payment of any Distribution (including any Additional Amounts) on, Redemption Price of, or Liquidation Distribution in respect of, any Common Security, and no other payment on account of the redemption, liquidation or other acquisition of Common Securities, shall be made unless payment in full in cash of all accumulated and unpaid Distributions (including any Additional Amounts) on all Outstanding Capital Securities for all Distribution Periods terminating on or prior thereto, or in the case of payment of the Redemption Price the full amount of such Redemption Price on all Outstanding Capital Securities then called for redemption, or in the case of payment of the Liquidation Distribution the full amount of such Liquidation Distribution on all Outstanding Capital Securities, shall have been made or provided for, and all funds immediately available to the Property Trustee shall first be applied to the payment in full in cash of all Distributions (including any Additional Amounts) on, or the Redemption Price of, the Capital Securities then due and payable. (b) In the case of the occurrence of any Event of Default resulting from any Debenture Event of Default, the Holders of the Common Securities shall have no right to act with respect to any such Event of Default under this Trust Agreement until the effect of all such Events of Default with respect to the Capital Securities have been cured, waived or otherwise eliminated. Until all such Events of Default under this Trust Agreement with respect to the Capital Securities have been so cured, waived or otherwise eliminated, the Property Trustee shall act solely on behalf of the Holders of the Capital Securities and not on behalf of the Holders of the Common Securities, and only the Holders of the Capital Securities will have the right to direct the Property Trustee to act on their behalf. SECTION 4.4. Payment Procedures. Payments of Distributions (including any Additional Amounts) in respect of the Capital Securities shall, subject to the next succeeding sentence, be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear on the Securities Register or, if the Capital Securities are held by a Clearing Agency, such Distributions shall be made to the Clearing Agency in immediately available funds. A Holder of $1,000,000 or more in aggregate Liquidation Amount of Capital Securities may receive payments of Distributions (including any 19
Additional Amounts) by wire transfer of immediately available funds upon written request to the Property Trustee not later than the 15/th/ calendar day, whether or not a Business Day, before the relevant Distribution Date. Payments in respect of the Common Securities shall be made in such manner as shall be mutually agreed between the Property Trustee and the Holders of the Common Securities. SECTION 4.5. Tax Returns and Reports.

The Administrative Trustees shall provide the Depositor and the Property Trustee with a copy of all such returns and reports promptly after such filing or furnishing.

The Depositor shall pay to the Issuer Trust, and reimburse the Issuer Trust for, the full amount of any costs, expenses or liabilities of the Issuer Trust (other than obligations of the Issuer Trust to pay the Holders of any Capital Securities or other similar interests in the Issuer Trust the amounts due such Holders pursuant to the terms of the Capital Securities or such other similar interests, as the case may be), including, without limitation, any taxes, duties or other governmental charges of whatever nature (other than withholding taxes) imposed on the Issuer Trust by the United States or any other taxing authority. Such payment obligation includes any such costs, expenses or liabilities of the Issuer Trust that are required by applicable law to be satisfied in connection with a dissolution of the Issuer Trust. SECTION 4.7. Payments under Indenture or Pursuant to Direct Actions. Any amount payable hereunder to any Holder of Capital Securities (or any Owner with respect thereto) shall be reduced by the amount of any corresponding payment such Holder (or Owner) has directly received pursuant to Section 508 of the Indenture or Section 5.14 of this Trust Agreement.

A transferee of a Trust Securities Certificate shall become a Holder, and shall be entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a Holder hereunder, upon due registration of such Trust Securities Certificate in such transferee's name pursuant to Sections 5.4, 5.11 and 5.13. SECTION 5.3. Execution and Delivery of Trust Securities Certificates.

In connection with the issuance of any new Trust Securities Certificate under this Section 5.5, the Administrative Trustees or the Securities Registrar may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. Any duplicate Trust Securities Certificate issued pursuant to this Section shall constitute conclusive evidence of an undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the Issuer Trust corresponding to that evidenced by the lost, stolen or destroyed Trust Securities Certificate, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Trust Securities Certificate shall be found at any time. 22

If Wells Fargo Bank shall no longer be the Paying Agent or a successor Paying Agent shall resign or its authority to act be revoked, the Property Trustee shall appoint a successor (which shall be a bank or trust company) that is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Trustees and the Depositor to act as Paying Agent. Such successor Paying Agent or any additional Paying Agent shall execute and deliver to the Issuer Trustees an instrument in which such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent shall agree with the Issuer Trustees that as Paying Agent, such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent will hold all sums, if any, held by it for payment to the Holders in trust for the benefit of the Holders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Holders.

(b) A single Common Securities Certificate representing the Common Securities shall be issued to the Depositor in the form of a definitive Common Securities Certificate. SECTION 5.12.

The Trust Securities shall have no preemptive or similar rights and when issued and delivered to Holders against payment of the purchase price therefor will be fully paid and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, nonassessable by the Issuer Trust. The Holders of the Trust Securities, in their capacities as such, shall be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. (b) For so long as any Capital Securities remain Outstanding, if, upon a Debenture Event of Default, the Debenture Trustee fails or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Debentures fail to declare the principal of all of the Debentures to be immediately due and payable, the Property Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities then Outstanding shall have the right to make such declaration by a notice in writing to the Depositor, the Debenture Trustee and the Property Trustee, in the case of notice by the Holders of the Capital Securities, or to the Depositor, the Debenture Trustee and the Holders of the Capital Securities, in the case of notice by the Property Trustee. At any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Debentures has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Debenture Trustee as in the Indenture provided, the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, by written notice to the Property Trustee, the Depositor and the Debenture Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if: (i) the Depositor has paid or deposited with the Debenture Trustee a sum sufficient to pay (A) all overdue installments of interest on all of the Debentures, (B) any accrued Additional Interest (as defined in the Indenture) on all of the Debentures, (C) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Debentures that have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest and Additional Interest (as defined in the Indenture) thereon at the rate borne by the Debentures, and (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Debenture Trustee under the Indenture and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Debenture Trustee and the Property Trustee, their agents and counsel; and 26
(ii) all Events of Default with respect to the Debentures, other than the non-payment of the principal of the Debentures that has become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513 of the Indenture. The Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Capital Securities, waive any past default under the Indenture, except a default in the payment of principal or interest (unless such default has been cured and a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest and principal due otherwise than by acceleration has been deposited with the Debenture Trustee) or a default in respect of a covenant or provision that under the Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Debenture. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon. Upon receipt by the Property Trustee of written notice declaring such an acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, by Holders of any part of the Capital Securities a record date shall be established for determining Holders of Outstanding Capital Securities entitled to join in such notice, which record date shall be at the close of business on the day the Property Trustee receives such notice. The Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such notice, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that, unless such declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall have become effective by virtue of the requisite percentage having joined in such notice prior to the day that is 90 days after such record date, such notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be canceled and of no further effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder, or a proxy of a Holder, from giving, after expiration of such 90-day period, a new written notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, as the case may be, that is identical to a written notice that has been canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in which event a new record date shall be established pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.14(b). (c) For so long as any Capital Securities remain Outstanding, to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the terms of this Trust Agreement and the Indenture, upon a Debenture Event of Default specified in Section 501(1) or 501(2) of the Indenture, any Holder of Capital Securities shall have the right to institute a proceeding directly against the Depositor, pursuant to Section 508 of the Indenture, for enforcement of payment to such Holder of any amounts payable in respect of Debentures having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities of such Holder (a "Direct Action"). Except as set forth in Section 5.14(b) and this Section 5.14(c), the Holders of Capital Securities shall have no right to exercise directly any right or remedy available to the holders of, or in respect of, the Debentures. (d) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 5.14, the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Capital Securities, waive any past default or Event of Default and its consequences. Upon such waiver, any such default or Event of Default shall cease to exist, and any default or Event of Default arising there from shall be deemed to have been cured, for every 27
purpose of this Trust Agreement, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. SECTION 5.15. CUSIP Numbers. The Administrative Trustees in issuing the Capital Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Property Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Capital Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Capital Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Administrative Trustees will promptly notify the Property Trustee of any change in the CUSIP numbers. ARTICLE 6 ACTS OF HOLDERS; MEETINGS; VOTING SECTION 6.1. Limitations on Voting Rights. (a) Except as expressly provided in this Trust Agreement and in the Indenture and as otherwise required by law, no Holder of Capital Securities shall have any right to vote or in any manner otherwise control the administration, operation and management of the Issuer Trust or the obligations of the parties hereto, nor shall anything herein set forth, or contained in the terms of the Trust Securities Certificates, be construed so as to constitute the Holders from time to time as partners or members of an association. (b) So long as any Debentures are held by the Property Trustee on behalf of the Issuer Trust, the Issuer Trustees shall not (i) direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Debenture Trustee, or execute any trust or power conferred on the Debenture Trustee with respect to the Debentures, (ii) waive any past default that may be waived under Section 513 of the Indenture, (iii) exercise any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Debentures shall be due and payable, or (iv) consent to any amendment, modification or termination of the Indenture or the Debentures, where such consent shall be required, without, in each case, obtaining the prior approval of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, provided, however, that where a consent under the Indenture would require the consent of each holder of Debentures affected thereby, no such consent shall be given by the Property Trustee without the prior written consent of each Holder of Capital Securities. The Property Trustee shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of the Capital Securities, except by a subsequent vote of the Holders of the Capital Securities. The Property Trustee shall notify all Holders of the Capital Securities of any notice of default received with respect to the Debentures. In addition to obtaining the foregoing approvals of the Holders of the Capital Securities, prior to taking any of the foregoing actions, the Issuer Trustees shall, at the expense of the Depositor, obtain an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that such action shall not cause the Issuer Trust to be taxable as a corporation or classified as other than a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes. 28
(c) If any proposed amendment to the Trust Agreement provides for, or the Issuer Trustees otherwise propose to effect, (i) any action that would adversely affect in any material respect the powers, preferences or special rights of the Capital Securities, whether by way of amendment to the Trust Agreement or otherwise, or (ii) the dissolution and winding-up of the Issuer Trust, other than pursuant to the terms of this Trust Agreement, then the Holders of Outstanding Capital Securities as a class will be entitled to vote on such amendment or proposal and such amendment or proposal shall not be effective except with the approval of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Trust Agreement, no amendment to this Trust Agreement may be made if, as a result of such amendment, it would cause the Issuer Trust to be taxable as a corporation or classified as other than a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes. SECTION 6.2. Notice of Meetings. Notice of all meetings of the Holders of the Capital Securities, stating the time, place and purpose of the meeting, shall be given by the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 10.8 to each Holder of Capital Securities, at such Holder's registered address, at least 15 days and not more than 90 days before the meeting. At any such meeting, any business properly before the meeting may be so considered whether or not stated in the notice of the meeting. Any adjourned meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice. SECTION 6.3. Meetings of Holders of the Capital Securities. No annual meeting of Holders is required to be held. The Property Trustee, however, shall call a meeting of the Holders of the Capital Securities to vote on any matter upon the written request of the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Outstanding Capital Securities and the Administrative Trustees or the Property Trustee may, at any time in their discretion, call a meeting of the Holders of the Capital Securities to vote on any matters as to which such Holders are entitled to vote. The Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of the Holders of the Capital Securities. If a quorum is present at a meeting, an affirmative vote by the Holders present, in person or by proxy, holding Capital Securities representing at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities held by the Holders present, either in person or by proxy, at such meeting shall constitute the action of the Holders of the Capital Securities, unless this Trust Agreement requires a greater number of affirmative votes. SECTION 6.4. Voting Rights. Holders shall be entitled to one vote for each $25 of Liquidation Amount represented by their Outstanding Trust Securities in respect of any matter as to which such Holders are entitled to vote. 29
SECTION 6.5. Proxies, etc. At any meeting of Holders, any Holder entitled to vote thereat may vote by proxy, provided that no proxy shall be voted at any meeting unless it shall have been placed on file with the Property Trustee, or with such other officer or agent of the Issuer Trust as the Property Trustee may direct, for verification prior to the time at which such vote shall be taken. Pursuant to a resolution of the Property Trustee, proxies may be solicited in the name of the Property Trustee or one or more officers of the Property Trustee. Only Holders of record shall be entitled to vote. When Trust Securities are held jointly by several persons, any one of them may vote at any meeting in person or by proxy in respect of such Trust Securities, but if more than one of them shall be present at such meeting in person or by proxy, and such joint owners or their proxies so present disagree as to any vote to be cast, such vote shall not be received in respect of such Trust Securities. A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a Holder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise, and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger. No proxy shall be valid more than three years after its date of execution. SECTION 6.6. Holder Action by Written Consent. Any action that may be taken by Holders at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if Holders holding at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of all Capital Securities entitled to vote in respect of such action (or such larger proportion thereof as shall be required by any other provision of this Trust Agreement) shall consent to the action in writing. SECTION 6.7. Record Date for Voting and Other Purposes. For the purposes of determining the Holders who are entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting or by written consent, or to participate in any distribution on the Trust Securities in respect of which a record date is not otherwise provided for in this Trust Agreement, or for the purpose of any other action, the Administrative Trustees may from time to time fix a date, not more than 90 days prior to the date of any meeting of Holders or the payment of a Distribution or other action, as the case may be, as a record date for the determination of the identity of the Holders of record for such purposes. SECTION 6.8. Acts of Holders. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Trust Agreement to be given, made or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Property Trustee. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Trust Agreement and (subject to Section 8.1) conclusive in favor of the Issuer Trustees, if made in the manner provided in this Section. 30
The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner that any Issuer Trustee receiving the same deems sufficient. The ownership of Trust Securities shall be proved by the Securities Register. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Trust Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Trust Security and the Holder of every Trust Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Issuer Trustees, or the Issuer Trust in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Trust Security. Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Trust Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the Liquidation Amount of such Trust Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such Liquidation Amount. If any dispute shall arise between the Holders and the Issuer Trustees or among the Holders or the Issuer Trustees with respect to the authenticity, validity or binding nature of any request, demand, authorization, direction, consent, waiver or other Act of such Holder or Issuer Trustee under this Article VI, then the determination of such matter by the Property Trustee shall be conclusive with respect to such matter. A Holder may institute a legal proceeding directly against the Depositor under the Guarantee to enforce its rights under the Guarantee without first instituting a legal proceeding against the Guarantee Trustee (as defined in the Guarantee), the Issuer Trust, any Issuer Trustee, or any person or entity. SECTION 6.9. Inspection of Records. Upon reasonable notice to the Administrative Trustees and the Property Trustee, the records of the Issuer Trust shall be open to inspection by Holders during normal business hours for any purpose reasonably related to such Holder's interest as a Holder. 31

SECTION 7.2. Representations and Warranties of Depositor. The Depositor hereby represents and warrants for the benefit of the Holders that: (a) the Trust Securities Certificates issued at the Time of Delivery on behalf of the Issuer Trust have been duly authorized and will have been duly and validly executed, issued and delivered by the Issuer Trustees pursuant to the terms and provisions of, and in accordance with the requirements of, this Trust Agreement, and the Holders will be, as of such date, entitled to the benefits of this Trust Agreement; and (b) there are no taxes, fees or other governmental charges payable by the Issuer Trust (or the Issuer Trustees on behalf of the Issuer Trust) under the laws of the State of Delaware or any political subdivision thereof in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by any Issuer Trustee of this Trust Agreement. ARTICLE 8 THE ISSUER TRUSTEES SECTION 8.1. Certain Duties and Responsibilities. (a) The duties and responsibilities of the Issuer Trustees shall be as provided by this Trust Agreement, subject to Section 10.10 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to Section 8.1(c), no provision of this Trust Agreement shall require any of the Issuer Trustees to expend or risk its or their own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its or their duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its or their rights or powers, if it or they shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Trust Agreement relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Issuer Trustees shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 8.1. To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Administrative Trustee has duties and liabilities relating to the Issuer Trust or to the Holders, such Administrative Trustee shall not be liable to the Issuer Trust or to any Holder for such Administrative Trustee's good faith reliance on the provisions of this Trust Agreement. The provisions of this Trust Agreement, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of the Administrative Trustees 33
otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Depositor and the Holders to replace such other duties and liabilities of the Administrative Trustees. (b) All payments made by the Property Trustee or a Paying Agent in respect of the Trust Securities shall be made only from the revenue and proceeds from the Trust Property and only to the extent that there shall be sufficient revenue or proceeds from the Trust Property to enable the Property Trustee or a Paying Agent to make payments in accordance with the terms hereof. Each Holder, by its acceptance of a Trust Security, agrees that it will look solely to the revenue and proceeds from the Trust Property to the extent legally available for distribution to it as herein provided and that the Issuer Trustees are not personally liable to such Holder for any amount distributable in respect of any Trust Security or for any other liability in respect of any Trust Security. This Section 8.1(b) does not limit the liability of the Issuer Trustees expressly set forth elsewhere in this Trust Agreement or, in the case of the Property Trustee, in the Trust Indenture Act. (c) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Property Trustee shall enforce this Trust Agreement for the benefit of the Holders. (d) The Property Trustee, before the occurrence of any Event of Default and after the curing of all Events of Default that may have occurred, shall undertake to perform only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Trust Agreement (including pursuant to Section 10.10), and no implied covenants shall be read into this Trust Agreement against the Property Trustee. If an Event of Default has occurred (that has not been cured or waived pursuant to Section 5.14, the Property Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Trust Agreement, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise thereof, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs. (e) No provision of this Trust Agreement shall be construed to relieve the Property Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that: (i) prior to the occurrence of any Event of Default and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default that may have occurred: (A) the duties and obligations of the Property Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Trust Agreement (including pursuant to Section 10.10), and the Property Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Trust Agreement (including pursuant to Section 10.10); and (B) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Property Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Trust Agreement; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions that by any provision hereof or of the Trust Indenture Act are specifically required to be furnished to the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee shall be under a duty to 34
examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Trust Agreement; (ii) the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by an authorized officer of the Property Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Property Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; (iii) the Property Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Property Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Property Trustee under this Trust Agreement; (iv) the Property Trustee's sole duty with respect to the custody, safe keeping and physical preservation of the Debentures and the Payment Account shall be to deal with such property in a similar manner as the Property Trustee deals with similar property for its own account, subject to the protections and limitations on liability afforded to the Property Trustee under this Trust Agreement and the Trust Indenture Act; (v) the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any interest on any money received by it except as it may otherwise agree with the Depositor; and money held by the Property Trustee need not be segregated from other funds held by it except in relation to the Payment Account maintained by the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 3.1 and except to the extent otherwise required by law; (vi) the Property Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the Administrative Trustees or the Depositor with their respective duties under this Trust Agreement, nor shall the Property Trustee be liable for the default or misconduct of any other Issuer Trustee, the Administrative Trustees or the Depositor; and (vii) subject to Section 8.1(c), no provision of this Trust Agreement shall require the Property Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if the Property Trustee shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the repayment of such funds or liability is not reasonably assured to it under the terms of this Trust Agreement or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. (f) The Administrative Trustees shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the other Issuer Trustees or the Depositor with their respective duties under this Trust Agreement, nor shall either Administrative Trustee be liable for the default or misconduct of any other Issuer Trustee or the Depositor. SECTION 8.2. Certain Notices. Within ninety days after the occurrence of any Event of Default actually known to the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee shall transmit, in the manner and to the extent provided in 35
Section 10.8, notice of such Event of Default to the Holders and the Administrative Trustees, unless such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived. Within five Business Days after the receipt of notice of the Depositor's exercise of its right to defer the payment of interest on the Debentures pursuant to the Indenture, the Property Trustee shall transmit, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 10.8, notice of such exercise to the Holders and the Administrative Trustees, unless such exercise shall have been revoked. The Property Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Event of Default unless the Property Trustee shall have received written notice or a Responsible Officer of the Property Trustee charged with the administration of this Trust Agreement shall have obtained actual knowledge of such Event of Default. SECTION 8.3. Certain Rights of Property Trustee. Subject to the provisions of Section 8.1: (a) the Property Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting in good faith upon any resolution, Opinion of Counsel, certificate, written representation of a Holder or transferee, certificate of auditors or any other certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, appraisal, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties; (b) if (i) in performing its duties under this Trust Agreement the Property Trustee is required to decide between alternative courses of action, (ii) in construing any of the provisions of this Trust Agreement the Property Trustee finds the same ambiguous or inconsistent with any other provisions contained herein, or (iii) the Property Trustee is unsure of the application of any provision of this Trust Agreement, then, except as to any matter as to which the Holders of the Capital Securities are entitled to vote under the terms of this Trust Agreement, the Property Trustee shall deliver a notice to the Depositor requesting the Depositor's opinion as to the course of action to be taken; provided, however, that if the Depositor fails to deliver such opinion, the Property Trustee shall take such action, or refrain from taking such action, as the Property Trustee shall deem advisable and in the best interests of the Holders, in which event the Property Trustee shall have no liability except for its own bad faith, negligence or willful misconduct; (c) any direction or act of the Depositor contemplated by this Trust Agreement shall be sufficiently evidenced by an Officers' Certificate; (d) any direction or act of an Administrative Trustee contemplated by this Trust Agreement shall be sufficiently evidenced by a certificate executed by such Administrative Trustee and setting forth such direction or act; (e) the Property Trustee shall have no duty to see to any recording, filing or registration of any instrument (including any financing or continuation statement or any filing under tax or securities laws) or any rerecording, refiling or re-registration thereof; 36
(f) the Property Trustee may consult with counsel (which counsel may be counsel to the Depositor or any of its Affiliates, and may include any of its employees) and the advice of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon and in accordance with such advice; the Property Trustee shall have the right at any time to seek instructions concerning the administration of this Trust Agreement from any court of competent jurisdiction; (g) the Property Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Trust Agreement at the request or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Trust Agreement, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Property Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities that might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction; provided that, nothing contained in this Section 8.3(g) shall be taken to relieve the Property Trustee, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, of its obligation to exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Trust Agreement; (h) the Property Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, unless requested in writing to do so by one or more Holders, but the Property Trustee may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit; (i) the Property Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through its agents or attorneys, provided that the Property Trustee shall be responsible for its own negligence or misconduct with respect to selection of any agent or attorney appointed by it hereunder; (j) whenever in the administration of this Trust Agreement the Property Trustee shall deem it desirable to receive instructions with respect to enforcing any remedy or right or taking any other action hereunder, the Property Trustee (i) may request instructions from the Holders (which instructions may only be given by the Holders of the same proportion in Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities as would be entitled to direct the Property Trustee under the terms of the Trust Securities in respect of such remedy, right or action), (ii) may refrain from enforcing such remedy or right or taking such other action until such instructions are received, and (iii) shall be protected in acting in accordance with such instructions; and (k) except as otherwise expressly provided by this Trust Agreement, the Property Trustee shall not be under any obligation to take any action that is discretionary under the provisions of this Trust Agreement. No provision of this Trust Agreement shall be deemed to impose any duty or obligation on any Issuer Trustee to perform any act or acts or exercise any right, power, duty or obligation conferred or imposed on it, in any jurisdiction in which it shall be illegal, or in which such Person shall be unqualified or incompetent in accordance with applicable law, to perform any such act or acts, or to exercise any such right, power, duty or obligation. No permissive power or authority available to any Issuer Trustee shall be construed to be a duty. 37
SECTION 8.4. Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities. The recitals contained herein and in the Trust Securities Certificates shall be taken as the statements of the Issuer Trust and the Depositor, and the Issuer Trustees do not assume any responsibility for their correctness. The Issuer Trustees shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Depositor of the proceeds of the Debentures. SECTION 8.5. May Hold Securities. Any Issuer Trustee or any other agent of any Issuer Trustee or the Issuer Trust, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Trust Securities and, subject to Sections 8.8 and 8.13, and except as provided in the definition of the term "Outstanding" in Article I, may otherwise deal with the Issuer Trust with the same rights it would have if it were not Issuer Trustee or such other agent. SECTION 8.6. Compensation; Indemnity; Fees. The Depositor agrees: (a) to pay to the Issuer Trustees from time to time such reasonable compensation for all services rendered by them hereunder as may be separately agreed by the Depositor and the Issuer Trustees from time to time (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust); (b) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Issuer Trustees upon request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Issuer Trustees in accordance with any provision of this Trust Agreement (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of their agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to their negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct; and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to indemnify and hold harmless (i) each Issuer Trustee, (ii) any Affiliate of any Issuer Trustee, (iii) any officer, director, shareholder, employee, representative or agent of any Issuer Trustee, and (iv) any employee or agent of the Issuer Trust (referred to herein as an "Indemnified Person") from and against any loss, damage, liability, tax, penalty, expense or claim of any kind or nature whatsoever incurred by such Indemnified Person by reason of the creation, operation or dissolution of the Issuer Trust or any act or omission performed or omitted by such Indemnified Person in good faith on behalf of the Issuer Trust and in a manner such Indemnified Person reasonably believed to be within the scope of authority conferred on such Indemnified Person by this Trust Agreement, except that no Indemnified Person shall be entitled to be indemnified in respect of any loss, damage or claim incurred by such Indemnified Person by reason of negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct with respect to such acts or omissions. The provisions of this Section 8.6 shall survive the termination of this Trust Agreement and the removal or resignation of any Issuer Trustee. 38
No Issuer Trustee may claim any Lien on any Trust Property as a result of any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.6. The Depositor and any Issuer Trustee may engage in or possess an interest in other business ventures of any nature or description, independently or with others, similar or dissimilar to the business of the Issuer Trust, and the Issuer Trust and the Holders of Trust Securities shall have no rights by virtue of this Trust Agreement in and to such independent ventures or the income or profits derived therefrom, and the pursuit of any such venture, even if competitive with the business of the Issuer Trust, shall not be deemed wrongful or improper. Neither the Depositor nor any Issuer Trustee shall be obligated to present any particular investment or other opportunity to the Issuer Trust even if such opportunity is of a character that, if presented to the Issuer Trust, could be taken by the Issuer Trust, and the Depositor and any Issuer Trustee shall have the right to take for its own account (individually or as a partner or fiduciary) or to recommend to others any such particular investment or other opportunity. Any Issuer Trustee may engage or be interested in any financial or other transaction with the Depositor or any Affiliate of the Depositor, or may act as depository for, trustee or agent for, or act on any committee or body of holders of, securities or other obligations of the Depositor or its Affiliates. SECTION 8.7. Corporate Property Trustee Required; Eligibility of Issuer Trustees and Administrative Trustees. (a) There shall at all times be a Property Trustee hereunder with respect to the Trust Securities. The Property Trustee shall be a Person that is a national or state chartered bank and eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act to act as such and that has a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If any such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of its supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section 8.7 and to the extent permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, the combined capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Property Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.7, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article VIII. At the time of appointment, the Property Trustee must have securities rated in one of the three highest rating categories by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. (b) There shall at all times be one or more Administrative Trustees hereunder with respect to the Trust Securities. Each Administrative Trustee shall be either a natural person who is at least 21 years of age or a legal entity that shall act through one or more persons authorized to bind that entity. (c) There shall at all times be a Delaware Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities. The Delaware Trustee shall either be (i) a natural person who is at least 21 years of age and a resident of the State of Delaware, or (ii) a legal entity with its principal place of business in the State of Delaware and that otherwise meets the requirements of applicable Delaware law and that shall act through one or more persons authorized to bind such entity. 39
SECTION 8.8. Conflicting Interests. (a) If the Property Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Property Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Trust Agreement. (b) The Guarantee Agreement and the Indenture shall be deemed to be specifically described in this Trust Agreement for the purposes of clause (i) of the first proviso contained in Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act. SECTION 8.9. Co-Trustees and Separate Trustee. Unless and until a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, at any time or times, for the purpose of meeting the legal requirements of the Trust Indenture Act or of any jurisdiction in which any part of the Trust Property may at the time be located, the Holder of Common Securities and the Administrative Trustees shall have the power to appoint one or more Persons either to act as co-trustee, jointly with the Property Trustee, of all or any part of such Trust Property, or to the extent required by law to act as separate trustee of any such property, in either case with such powers as may be provided in the instrument of appointment, and to vest in such Person or Persons in the capacity aforesaid, any property, title, right or power deemed necessary or desirable, subject to the other provisions of this Section. If a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Property Trustee shall have the sole power to so appoint such a co-trustee or separate trustee, and upon the written request of the Property Trustee, the Depositor and the Administrative Trustees shall for such purpose join with the Property Trustee in the execution, delivery, and performance of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to appoint, such co-trustee or separate trustee. Any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed pursuant to this Section shall either be (i) a natural person who is at least 21 years of age and a resident of the United States, or (ii) a legal entity with its principal place of business in the United States that shall act through one or more persons authorized to bind such entity. Should any written instrument from the Depositor be required by any co-trustee or separate trustee so appointed for more fully confirming to such co-trustee or separate trustee such property, title, right, or power, any and all such instruments shall, on request, be executed, acknowledged and delivered by the Depositor. Every co-trustee or separate trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, but to such extent only, be appointed subject to the following terms, namely: (a) The Trust Securities shall be executed by one or more Administrative Trustees, and the Trust Securities shall be delivered by the Property Trustee, and all rights, powers, duties, and obligations hereunder in respect of the custody of securities, cash and other personal property held by, or required to be deposited or pledged with, the Property Trustee specified hereunder shall be exercised solely by the Property Trustee and not by such co-trustee or separate trustee. 40
(b) The rights, powers, duties, and obligations hereby conferred or imposed upon the Property Trustee in respect of any property covered by such appointment shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed by the Property Trustee or by the Property Trustee and such co-trustee or separate trustee jointly, as shall be provided in the instrument appointing such co-trustee or separate trustee, except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act is to be performed, the Property Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations shall be exercised and performed by such co-trustee or separate trustee. (c) The Property Trustee at any time, by an instrument in writing executed by it, with the written concurrence of the Depositor, may accept the resignation of or remove any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed under this Section 8.9, and, in case a Debenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Property Trustee shall have power to accept the resignation of, or remove, any such co-trustee or separate trustee without the concurrence of the Depositor. Upon the written request of the Property Trustee, the Depositor shall join with the Property Trustee in the execution, delivery and performance of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to effectuate such resignation or removal. A successor to any co-trustee or separate trustee so resigning or removed may be appointed in the manner provided in this Section 8.9. (d) No co-trustee or separate trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of the Property Trustee or any other trustee hereunder. (e) The Property Trustee shall not be liable by reason of any act of a co-trustee or separate trustee. (f) Any Act of Holders delivered to the Property Trustee shall be deemed to have been delivered to each such co-trustee and separate trustee. SECTION 8.10. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor. No resignation or removal of any Issuer Trustee (the "Relevant Trustee") and no appointment of a successor Issuer Trustee pursuant to this Article VIII shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Issuer Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, the Relevant Trustee may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Holders and by appointing a successor Relevant Trustee. The Relevant Trustee shall appoint a successor by requesting from at least three Persons meeting the eligibility requirements its expenses and charges to serve as the Relevant Trustee on a form provided by the Administrative Trustees, and selecting the Person who agrees to the lowest expenses and charges. If the instrument of acceptance by the successor Issuer Trustee required by Section 8.11 shall not have been delivered to the Relevant Trustee within 60 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the Relevant Trustee may petition, at the expense of the Depositor, in the case of the Property Trustee, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee. The Administrative Trustees, or any of them, may be removed at any time by Act of the Holders of Common Securities delivered to the Relevant Trustee. 41
The Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, or both of them, may be removed by Act of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, delivered to the Relevant Trustee (in its individual capacity and, in the case of the Property Trustee, on behalf of the Issuer Trust) (i) for cause (including upon the occurrence of an Event of Default described in subparagraph (d) of the definition thereof with respect to the Relevant Trustee), or (ii) at any time if a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Unless and until a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, or both of them, may be removed at any time by Act of the Holders of the Common Securities. If a resigning Property Trustee or Delaware Trustee shall fail to appoint a successor, or if the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee shall be removed or become incapable of acting as Issuer Trustee, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee for any cause, the Holders of the Common Securities by Act of such Holders delivered to the Relevant Trustee or, if a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Holders of the Capital Securities, by Act of the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities then Outstanding delivered to such Relevant Trustee, may appoint a successor Relevant Trustee or Trustees, and such successor Issuer Trustee shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11. If no successor Relevant Trustee shall have been so appointed by the Holders of the Common Securities or Capital Securities, as the case may be, and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 8.11, any Holder, on behalf of such Holder and all others similarly situated, or any other Issuer Trustee, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee. The Property Trustee shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of an Issuer Trustee and each appointment of a successor Issuer Trustee to all Holders in the manner provided in Section 10.8 and shall give notice to the Depositor and to the Administrative Trustees. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Relevant Trustee and the address of its Corporate Trust Office if it is the Property Trustee. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Trust Agreement, if any Delaware Trustee who is a natural person dies or becomes, in the opinion of the Holders of the Common Securities, incompetent or incapacitated, the vacancy created by such death, incompetence or incapacity may be filled by the Property Trustee following the procedures regarding expenses and charges set forth above (with the successor being a Person who satisfies the eligibility requirement for the Delaware Trustee set forth in Section 8.7). SECTION 8.11. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor. In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Relevant Trustee, the retiring Relevant Trustee and each successor Relevant Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities shall execute and deliver an amendment hereto wherein each successor Relevant Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (a) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Relevant Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Relevant Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities and the Issuer Trust, and (b) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Trust Agreement as shall 42
be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the Issuer Trust by more than one Relevant Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such amendment shall constitute such Relevant Trustees co-trustees and upon the execution and delivery of such amendment the resignation or removal of the retiring Relevant Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Relevant Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Relevant Trustee, other than the filing of an amendment to the Certificate of Trust to the extent required under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act; but, on request of the Issuer Trust or any successor Relevant Trustee such retiring Relevant Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Relevant Trustee all Trust Property, all proceeds thereof and money held by such retiring Relevant Trustee hereunder with respect to the Trust Securities and the Issuer Trust. Upon request of any such successor Relevant Trustee, the Issuer Trust shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Relevant Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the preceding paragraph. No successor Relevant Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Relevant Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article VIII. SECTION 8.12. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business. Any Person into which the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Relevant Trustee shall be a party, or any Person, succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of such Relevant Trustee, shall be the successor of such Relevant Trustee hereunder, provided that such Person shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article VIII, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, other than the filing of an amendment to the Certificate of Trust to the extent required under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. SECTION 8.13. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Depositor or Issuer Trust. If and when the Property Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Depositor or the Issuer Trust (or any other obligor upon the Capital Securities), the Property Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Depositor or the Issuer Trust (or any such other obligor). SECTION 8.14. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. In case of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other similar judicial proceeding relative to the Issuer Trust or any other obligor upon the Trust Securities or the property of the Issuer Trust or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Property Trustee (irrespective of whether any Distributions on the Trust Securities shall then be due and payable and irrespective of whether the Property Trustee shall have made any demand on the Issuer Trust for the payment of any past due 43
Distributions) shall be entitled and empowered, to the fullest extent permitted by law, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of any Distributions owing and unpaid in respect of the Trust Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Property Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Property Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding, and (b) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Property Trustee and, in the event the Property Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Property Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Property Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Property Trustee. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Property Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement adjustment or compensation affecting the Trust Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Property Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding. SECTION 8.15. Reports by Property Trustee. (a) Within 60 days after May 15 of each year commencing with May 15, 2005, the Property Trustee shall transmit to all Holders in accordance with Section 10.8, and to the Depositor, a brief report dated as of the immediately preceding May 15 with respect to: (i) its eligibility under Section 8.7 or, in lieu thereof, if to the best of its knowledge it has continued to be eligible under said Section, a written statement to such effect; (ii) a statement that the Property Trustee has complied with all of its obligations under this Trust Agreement during the twelve-month period (or, in the case of the initial report, the period since the Closing Date) ending with such May 15 or, if the Property Trustee has not complied in any material respect with such obligations, a description of such noncompliance; and (iii) any change in the property and funds in its possession as Property Trustee since the date of its last report and any action taken by the Property Trustee in the performance of its duties hereunder which it has not previously reported and which in its opinion materially affects the Trust Securities. (b) In addition, the Property Trustee shall transmit to Holders such reports concerning the Property Trustee and its actions under this Trust Agreement as may be required pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act at the times and in the manner provided pursuant thereto. 44
(c) A copy of each such report shall, at the time of such transmission to Holders, be filed by the Property Trustee with the Depositor. SECTION 8.16. Reports to the Property Trustee. Each of the Depositor and the Administrative Trustees shall provide to the Property Trustee such documents, reports and information as required by Section 314 of the Trust Indenture Act (if any) and the compliance certificate required by Section 314(a) of the Trust Indenture Act in the form, in the manner and at the times required by Section 314 of the Trust Indenture Act. The Depositor and the Administrative Trustees shall annually file with the Property Trustee a certificate specifying whether such Person is in compliance with all of the terms and covenants applicable to such Person hereunder. SECTION 8.17. Evidence of Compliance with Conditions Precedent. Each of the Depositor and the Administrative Trustees shall provide to the Property Trustee such evidence of compliance with any conditions precedent, if any, provided for in this Trust Agreement that relate to any of the matters set forth in Section 314(c) of the Trust Indenture Act. Any certificate or opinion required to be given by an officer pursuant to Section 314(c)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act shall be given in the form of an Officers' Certificate. SECTION 8.18. Number of Issuer Trustees. (a) The number of Issuer Trustees shall be four, unless the Property Trustee also acts as the Delaware Trustee, in which case the number of Issuer Trustees may be three. (b) If an Issuer Trustee ceases to hold office for any reason, a vacancy shall occur. The vacancy shall be filled with an Issuer Trustee appointed in accordance with Section 8.10. (c) The death, resignation, retirement, removal, bankruptcy, incompetence or incapacity to perform the duties of an Issuer Trustee shall not operate to annul or dissolve the Issuer Trust. SECTION 8.19. Delegation of Power. (a) Any Administrative Trustee may, by power of attorney consistent with applicable law, delegate to any other natural person over the age of 21 his or her power for the purpose of executing any documents contemplated in Section 2.7(a) or making any governmental filing; and (b) The Administrative Trustees shall have power to delegate from time to time to such of their number the doing of such things and the execution of such instruments either in the name of the Issuer Trust or the names of the Administrative Trustees or otherwise as the Administrative Trustees may deem expedient, to the extent such delegation is not prohibited by applicable law or contrary to the provisions of this Trust Agreement. 45
ARTICLE 9 DISSOLUTION, LIQUIDATION AND MERGER SECTION 9.1. Dissolution Upon Expiration Date. Unless earlier dissolved, the Issuer Trust shall automatically dissolve, and its affairs be wound up, on April 8, 2035 (the "Expiration Date"), following the distribution of the Trust Property in accordance with Section 9.4. SECTION 9.2. Early Dissolution. The first to occur of any of the following events is an "Early Dissolution Event": (a) the occurrence of a Depositor Bankruptcy Event in respect of, or the dissolution or liquidation of, the Depositor, in its capacity as the Holder of the Common Securities, unless the Depositor shall transfer the Common Securities as provided by Section 5.10, in which case this provision shall refer instead to any such successor Holder of the Common Securities; (b) the written direction to the Property Trustee from all of the Holders of the Common Securities at any time to dissolve the Issuer Trust and to distribute the Debentures to Holders in exchange for the Capital Securities (which direction is optional and wholly within the discretion of the Holders of the Common Securities); (c) the redemption of all of the Capital Securities in connection with the redemption or repayment of all the Debentures; and (d) the entry of an order for dissolution of the Issuer Trust by a court of competent jurisdiction. SECTION 9.3. Dissolution. The respective obligations and responsibilities of the Issuer Trustees, the Administrative Trustees and the Issuer Trust created and continued hereby shall terminate upon the latest to occur of the following: (a) the distribution by the Property Trustee to Holders of all amounts required to be distributed hereunder upon the liquidation of the Issuer Trust pursuant to Section 9.4, or upon the redemption of all of the Trust Securities pursuant to Section 4.2; (b) the payment of any expenses owed by the Issuer Trust; and (c) the discharge of all administrative duties of the Administrative Trustees, including the performance of any tax reporting obligations with respect to the Issuer Trust or the Holders. SECTION 9.4. Liquidation. (a) If an Early Dissolution Event specified in clause (a), (b) or (d) of Section 9.2 occurs or upon the Expiration Date, the Issuer Trust shall be liquidated by the Property Trustee as expeditiously as the Property Trustee determines to be possible by distributing, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Issuer Trust as provided by applicable law, to each Holder a Like Amount of Debentures, subject to Section 9.4(d). Notice of liquidation shall be given by the Property Trustee by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor 46
more than 60 days prior to the Liquidation Date to each Holder of Trust Securities at such Holder's address appearing in the Securities Register. All such notices of liquidation shall: (i) state the CUSIP Number of the Trust Securities; (ii) state the Liquidation Date; (iii) state that from and after the Liquidation Date, the Trust Securities will no longer be deemed to be Outstanding and any Trust Securities Certificates not surrendered for exchange will be deemed to represent a Like Amount of Debentures, or if Section 9.4(d) applies, a right to receive a Liquidating Distribution; and (iv) provide such information with respect to the mechanics by which Holders may exchange Trust Securities Certificates for Debentures, or if Section 9.4(d) applies, receive a Liquidation Distribution, as the Property Trustee (after consultation with the Administrative Trustees) shall deem appropriate. (b) Except where Section 9.2(c) or 9.4(d) applies, in order to effect the liquidation of the Issuer Trust and distribution of the Debentures to Holders, the Property Trustee, either itself acting as exchange agent or through the appointment of a separate exchange agent, shall establish a record date for such distribution (which shall be not more than 30 days prior to the Liquidation Date) and, establish such procedures as it shall deem appropriate to effect the distribution of Debentures in exchange for the Outstanding Trust Securities Certificates. (c) Except where Section 9.2(c) or 9.4(d) applies, after the Liquidation Date, (i) the Trust Securities will no longer be deemed to be Outstanding, (ii) certificates representing a Like Amount of Debentures will be issued to Holders of Trust Securities Certificates, upon surrender of such Certificates to the exchange agent for exchange, (iii) any Trust Securities Certificates not so surrendered for exchange will be deemed to represent a Like Amount of Debentures bearing accrued and unpaid interest in an amount equal to the accumulated and unpaid Distributions on such Trust Securities Certificates until such certificates are so surrendered (and until such certificates are so surrendered, no payments of interest or principal will be made to Holders of Trust Securities Certificates with respect to such Debentures) and (iv) all rights of Holders holding Trust Securities will cease, except the right of such Holders to receive Debentures upon surrender of Trust Securities Certificates. (d) If, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 9.4, whether because of an order for dissolution entered by a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, distribution of the Debentures in the manner provided herein is determined by the Property Trustee not to be practical, or if an Early Dissolution Event specified in clause (c) of Section 9.2 occurs, the Trust Property shall be liquidated, and the Issuer Trust shall be dissolved and its affairs wound-up, by the Property Trustee in such manner as the Property Trustee determines. In such event, on the date of the dissolution, winding-up or other termination of the Issuer Trust, Holders will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Issuer Trust available for distribution to Holders, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Issuer Trust as provided by applicable law, an amount equal to the Liquidation Amount per Trust Security plus accumulated and unpaid Distributions thereon to the date of payment (such amount being the "Liquidation Distribution"). If, upon any 47
such dissolution, winding up or termination, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Issuer Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then, subject to the next succeeding sentence, the amounts payable by the Issuer Trust on the Trust Securities shall be paid on a pro rata basis (based upon Liquidation Amounts). The Holders of the Common Securities will be entitled to receive Liquidation Distributions upon any such dissolution, winding-up or termination pro rata (determined as aforesaid) with Holders of Capital Securities, except that, if a Debenture Event of Default specified in Section 501(1) or 501(2) of the Indenture has occurred and is continuing, the Capital Securities shall have a priority over the Common Securities as provided in Section 4.3. SECTION 9.5. Mergers, Consolidations, Amalgamations or Replacements of Issuer Trust. The Issuer Trust may not merge with or into, consolidate, amalgamate, or be replaced by, or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any corporation or other body, except pursuant to this Section 9.5. At the request of the Holders of the Common Securities, with the consent of the Administrative Trustees, but without the consent of the Holders of the Capital Securities, the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, the Issuer Trust may merge with or into, consolidate, amalgamate, or be replaced by or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to a trust organized as such under the laws of any state; provided, that (i) such successor entity either (a) expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Issuer Trust with respect to the Capital Securities, or (b) substitutes for the Capital Securities other securities having substantially the same terms as the Capital Securities (the "Successor Securities") so long as the Successor Securities have the same priority as the Capital Securities with respect to distributions and payments upon liquidation, redemption and otherwise, (ii) a trustee of such successor entity possessing the same powers and duties as the Property Trustee is appointed to hold the Debentures, (iii) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not cause the Capital Securities (including any Successor Securities) to be downgraded by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, (iv) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the Capital Securities (including any Successor Securities) in any material respect, (v) such successor entity has a purpose substantially identical to that of the Issuer Trust, (vi) prior to such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease, the Property Trustee has received an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that (a) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the Holders of the Capital Securities (including any Successor Securities) in any material respect, and (b) following such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease, neither the Issuer Trust nor such successor entity will be required to register as an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act, and (vii) the Depositor or its permitted transferee owns all of the Common Securities of such successor entity and guarantees the obligations of such successor entity under the Successor Securities at least to the extent provided by the Guarantee Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer Trust shall not, except with the consent of Holders of all of the Capital Securities, consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or be replaced by or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any other entity or permit any other entity to consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or replace it if such consolidation, 48
amalgamation, merger, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease would cause the Issuer Trust or the successor entity to be taxable as a corporation or classified as other than a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes. ARTICLE 10 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS SECTION 10.1. Limitation of Rights of Holders. Except as set forth in Section 9.2, the death or incapacity of any person having an interest, beneficial or otherwise, in Trust Securities shall not operate to terminate this Trust Agreement, nor entitle the legal representatives or heirs of such person or any Holder for such person, to claim an accounting, take any action or bring any proceeding in any court for a partition or winding up of the arrangements contemplated hereby, nor otherwise affect the rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties hereto or any of them. SECTION 10.2. Amendment. (a) This Trust Agreement may be amended from time to time by the Administrative Trustees and the Holders of all of the Common Securities, without the consent of any Holder of the Capital Securities, (i) to cure any ambiguity, correct or supplement any provision herein that may be inconsistent with any other provision herein, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under this Trust Agreement, which shall not be inconsistent with the other provisions of this Trust Agreement, or (ii) to modify, eliminate or add to any provisions of this Trust Agreement to such extent as shall be necessary to ensure that the Issuer Trust will not be taxable as a corporation or classified as other than a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes at all times that any Trust Securities are outstanding or to ensure that the Issuer Trust will not be required to register as an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act; provided, however, that in the case of either clause (i) or (ii), such action shall not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Holder. (b) Except as provided in Section 10.2(c), any provision of this Trust Agreement may be amended by the Administrative Trustees, the Property Trustee, and the Holders of all of the Common Securities and with (i) the consent of Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, and (ii) receipt by the Issuer Trustees of an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such amendment or the exercise of any power granted to the Trustees or the Administrative Trustees in accordance with such amendment will not affect the Trust's status as a grantor trust or cause the Issuer Trust to be taxable as a corporation or as other than a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes or affect the Issuer Trust's exemption from status as an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act. (c) In addition to and notwithstanding any other provision in this Trust Agreement, without the consent of each affected Holder (such consent being obtained in accordance with Section 6.3 or 6.6 hereof), this Trust Agreement may not be amended to (i) change the amount or timing of any Distribution on the Trust Securities or otherwise adversely affect the amount of any Distribution required to be made in respect of the Trust Securities as of a specified date, or (ii) restrict the right of a Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or 49
after such date; and notwithstanding any other provision herein, without the unanimous consent of the Holders (such consent being obtained in accordance with Section 6.3 or 6.6 hereof), this paragraph (c) of this Section 10.2 may not be amended.

The Guarantee Trustee shall have the right at any time to seek instructions concerning the administration of this Guarantee Agreement from any court of competent jurisdiction. (v) The Guarantee Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Guarantee Agreement at the request or direction of any Holder unless such Holder shall have provided to the Guarantee Trustee such adequate security and indemnity as would satisfy a reasonable person in the position of the Guarantee Trustee against the costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) and liabilities that might be incurred by it in complying with such request or direction, including such reasonable advances as may be requested by the Guarantee Trustee; provided that nothing contained in this Section (a)(v) shall be taken to relieve the 8

Any interest not punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall have the right, at any time during the term of this Security, from time to time to defer the payment of interest on this Security for up to 20 consecutive quarterly interest payment periods with respect to each deferral period (each an "Extension Period"), during which Extension Period the Company shall have the right to make a partial payment of interest on any Interest Payment Date, at the end of which the Company shall pay all interest then accrued and unpaid including any Additional Interest, as provided below; provided, however, that no Extension Period shall extend beyond the Maturity of the principal of this Security and no such Extension Period may end other than at the end of a full quarterly interest period; and provided, further, however, that during any such Extension Period, the Company shall not (i) make any payment of principal of or interest or premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt securities of the Company that rank pari passu in all respects with or junior in interest to this Security (except for any partial payments of interest with respect to and permitted under the Securities of this series), or (ii) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Company's capital stock (other than (a) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the Company in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors, consultants or independent contractors, in connection with a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan or in connection with the issuance of capital stock of the Company (or securities convertible into or exercisable for such capital stock) as consideration in an acquisition transaction entered into prior to the applicable Extension Period, (b) as a result of an exchange, redemption or conversion of any class or series of the Company's capital stock (or any capital stock of a subsidiary of the Company) for any other class or series of the Company's capital stock or of any class or series of the Company's indebtedness for any class or series of the Company's capital stock, (c) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company's capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged, (d) any declaration of a dividend in connection with any Rights Plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any Rights Plan, or the redemption or repurchase of rights pursuant thereto, (e) payments by the Company under the Guarantee Agreement, or (f) any 2
dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks pari passu with or junior to such stock). Prior to the termination of any such Extension Period, the Company may further defer the payment of interest, provided that no Extension Period shall exceed 20 consecutive quarterly interest payment periods, extend beyond the Maturity of the principal of this Security or end other than at the end of a full quarterly interest period. Upon the termination of any such Extension Period and upon the payment of all accrued and unpaid interest and any Additional Interest then due on any Interest Payment Date, the Company may elect to begin a new Extension Period, subject to the above conditions. No interest or Additional Interest shall be due and payable during an Extension Period, except at the end thereof, but each installment of interest that would otherwise have been due and payable during such Extension Period shall bear Additional Interest (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable) at the rate of 5.625% per annum, compounded quarterly and calculated as set forth in the first paragraph of this Security, from the dates on which amounts would otherwise have been due and payable until paid or made available for payment. The Company shall give the Holder of this Security and the Trustee notice of its election to begin any Extension Period at least one Business Day prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date on which interest on this Security would be payable but for such deferral or, so long as such Securities are held by or on behalf of Wells Fargo Capital IX, at least one Business Day prior to the earlier of (i) the next succeeding date on which Distributions on the Capital Trust Securities of such Issuer Trust would be payable but for such deferral, and (ii) the date on which the Property Trustee of such Issuer Trust is required to give notice to holders of such Capital Trust Securities of the record date or the date such Distributions are payable. Payment of interest, including Additional Interest, on this Security will be made in immediately available funds at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the City of Minneapolis, Minnesota, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that, at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be paid by check mailed to the Person entitled thereto at such Person's last address as it appears in the Security Register or, upon written request of a Holder of $1,000,000 or more in aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series not less than 15 calendar days prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date, by wire transfer to such account as may have been designated by such Person. Payment of principal of and interest, including Additional Interest, on this Security at Maturity will be made against presentation of this Security at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the City of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place. Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature or its duly authorized agent under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose. 3
