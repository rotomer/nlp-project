Exhibit 99.1
Second Quarter 2004 Highlights:
 
SAN FRANCISCO  Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) reported diluted earnings per common share of $1.00 for second quarter 2004, compared with $.90 in second quarter 2003, up 11 percent. Net income was $1.71 billion, up 12 percent from $1.53 billion in second quarter 2003. For the first half of 2004, net income was $3.48 billion, up 15 percent from the first half of 2003, and diluted earnings per share were $2.03, up 14 percent from the first half of 2003.
      "Thanks to the outstanding efforts of our 146,000 talented team members this was another strong quarter with double-digit growth in earnings per share, good growth in revenue, loans, deposits and continued improvement in credit quality," said Chairman and CEO Dick Kovacevich. "These results were achieved despite a reduction of $.14 in earnings per share from various interest rate-related balance sheet repositioning actions (described below in the Financial Performance section) which were designed to increase earning asset yields and reduce funding costs in the future. We've made significant investments in our people, systems and distribution network to earn even more of our customers' business and help continue our earnings momentum for the Next Stage' of our growth. The last three years we've invested more than $1 billion in our people alone. Since 2000, we've added about 8,600 sales people in our businesses, up 30 percent. Already this year, we've opened more than 50 new banking stores, a rate unprecedented in our Company's history. We now have more than 6,000 total stores across North America, another Wells Fargo milestone.
      These investments are paying off in significantly higher productivity and our customers are giving us more of their business, reflected in higher loan balances, deposits and cross-sell. For example, core product sales in Regional Banking were up almost 16 percent compared with second quarter last year. Our sales of product packs to our new banking households were up 25 percent so far this year compared with the same period last year. Our average banking household now has 4.4 products with us, which we believe is among the highest, if not the highest, in our industry. This includes customers who have not been with us for a full year, including the 39,000 who joined us from the recently-acquired Pacific Northwest Bancorp. Our average commercial/corporate customer has 5 products. Four of every ten of our mortgages originated in California were from our banking customers as were a third of our new investment brokerage sales across our 23 banking states."
Financial Performance
      Diluted earnings per share were $1.00 for second quarter 2004, up 11 percent from $.90 in second quarter 2003, the eleventh consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. Second quarter results included $.01 per share of market-sensitive income (net gains and losses on debt securities available for sale and equity investments) compared with $.05 in first quarter. "We're very pleased to report another quarter of outstanding and broad-based results," said Howard Atkins, Chief Financial Officer.
      Wells Fargo has historically had one of the highest earning asset yields and one of the lowest average costs of debt among large U.S. banks. Taking advantage of market opportunities available during the second quarter, the Company took a number of actions to further increase the yield on its earning assets and to reduce the cost of its long-term funding. "On the debt side of our balance sheet, the Company repurchased $2.4 billion of long-term debt with a weighted-average coupon of 6.20 percent," said Atkins. As previously disclosed, this buyback increased second quarter noninterest expense and reduced pre-tax earnings by $176 million or $.06 per share after-tax. In addition, the Company recorded losses of
 
$222 million, or $.08 per share after-tax, connected with the sale of $14 billion of securities and adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) with yields below 4 percent and replaced most of those assets with newer securities yielding close to 6 percent and with newly originated, higher-yielding ARMs. "After lengthening the duration of our funding at lower interest rates between mid 2003 and early 2004 and after continued strong growth in core checking account balances, the net effect of these actions was to improve asset yields and to reduce long-term debt cost without adding interest rate risk," said Atkins. "Taken together, the repositioning actions had a $.14 earnings per share after-tax impact. To the extent markets remain as volatile as they were in the second quarter, we may take advantage of additional opportunities to further improve asset yields or reduce long-term funding costs in the future."
Revenue
      Revenue of $7.4 billion for second quarter 2004 grew $496 million, or 7 percent, from a year ago. Revenue was reduced by $222 million, or 3 percent, in second quarter 2004 by the losses taken on the asset repositioning actions in the quarter. "Revenue growth was broad-based with strong results from most of our businesses, including consumer deposits and loans, payment processing, insurance brokerage, trust and investments including private client services, small business, corporate banking, mortgage banking and consumer finance," said Atkins. On a linked-quarter basis, revenue increased $279 million, or 16 percent (annualized).
Loans
      Average loans of $266.2 billion in second quarter 2004 increased $61.4 billion, or 30 percent, from second quarter 2003, and $9.8 billion, or 15 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis. Average commercial and commercial real estate loans increased $5.1 billion, or 6 percent, from second quarter 2003, and $2.3 billion, or 11 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis. "Commercial loan growth this quarter was broad-based across virtually all of our segments, including small business, middle market, commercial real estate, leasing, trade finance, and asset-based lending, and included the first meaningful increase in middle-market loan demand we've seen in nine quarters," said Atkins.
      "In addition to commercial loan growth, we also saw continued strong demand for consumer credit," said Atkins. Average consumer loans, including home equity and home mortgage, credit card and revolving credit and installment loan products, increased $56 billion, or 48 percent, from second quarter 2003, and $7.3 billion, or 18 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis.
Deposits
      Average core deposits of $224.9 billion for second quarter 2004 grew $19.5 billion, or 9 percent, from second quarter 2003, and increased $11.8 billion, or 22 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis. Average mortgage escrow deposits were $16.8 billion for second quarter 2004, down $4.0 billion from second quarter 2003 and up $4.3 billion from first quarter 2004. Excluding mortgage escrow deposits, total average core deposits grew $23.5 billion, or 13 percent, from second quarter 2003 and $7.5 billion, or 15 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis.
      Average consumer checking account balances grew 13 percent from second quarter 2003 and 21 percent (annualized) on a linked-quarter basis, reflecting a 4.7 percent net increase
 
in consumer checking accounts from a year ago and higher average balances. "We continued to experience exceptional growth in basic core deposits," said Atkins.
Net Interest Income
      Net interest income in second quarter 2004 increased 6 percent from second quarter 2003 on 12 percent earning asset growth, partially offset by a decline in the net interest margin. On a linked-quarter basis, net interest income was up $176 million, or 17 percent (annualized). This increase was driven by a $11.8 billion increase in average mortgage loans held for sale and a $9.8 billion increase in average total loans, which grew 30 percent year-over-year and 15 percent (annualized) on a linked-quarter basis. Net interest margin was 4.83 percent, down 11 basis points from first quarter 2004, primarily due to the substantial growth in earning assets during the quarter, including the mortgage warehouse and renewed growth in commercial and commercial real estate loans.
Noninterest Income
      Noninterest income in second quarter 2004 increased $243 million, or 8 percent, from second quarter 2003. Second quarter 2004 noninterest income was reduced by $222 million of losses taken to reposition the balance sheet to further increase earning asset yields. "The growth in fee income reflected strength in trust and investment fees, deposit service charges, credit card fees, loan fees and insurance," said Atkins.
      Noninterest income increased $103 million on a linked-quarter basis, including the $222 million of balance sheet repositioning losses ($61 million in bond losses and $161 million in losses related to the sale of lowest-yielding ARMs). Mortgage banking noninterest income was up $178 million, and included a mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance release, net of hedge losses, of $375 million.
Noninterest Expense
      Noninterest expense was $4.4 billion in second quarter 2004, compared with $4.2 billion in second quarter 2003. Almost all of the year-over-year increase was due to the $176 million in debt repurchase cost incurred in the second quarter 2004. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense increased $324 million primarily reflecting the debt repurchase cost and higher Home Mortgage production and temporary staffing costs. The efficiency ratio was 58.6 percent in second quarter 2004, compared with 60.0 percent in second quarter 2003 and 56.4 percent in first quarter 2004. The reduction in revenue and increase in expenses from the balance sheet repositioning actions taken during the quarter accounted for 400 basis points of the 58.6 percent efficiency ratio this quarter.
Credit Quality
      "Credit quality continued to exceed our expectations," said Chief Credit Officer Dave Munio. Second quarter losses were $390 million (.59 percent of loans outstanding annualized), down from the prior quarter's $404 million (.63 percent) and $415 million (.81 percent) one year ago. "Commercial portfolios performed well, at the low end of expected loss rates," said Munio. "Consumer losses have been consistently lower than expectations due to strong real estate and vehicle collateral values, modest year-over-year declines in new bankruptcy filings and higher than expected turnover in consumer portfolios. As we have said for a number of quarters, we may see somewhat greater nonperforming loans and higher losses and loss rates in
 
some of our high-growth consumer portfolios, including home equity and consumer finance, as these portfolios season over time."
      The provision expense of $440 million for second quarter 2004 exceeded net charge-offs by $50 million and the allowance for loan losses increased from $3.89 billion at March 31, 2004 to $3.94 billion at June 30, 2004. "We remain very comfortable with the performance of our credit, as exhibited by our current period losses," said Munio. "The increase in our allowance was necessary given the sustained growth of our consumer portfolio, particularly related to Wells Fargo Financial."
      Nonperforming assets were $1.6 billion, or .60 percent of total loans, at June 30, 2004, flat on a linked-quarter basis, down 8 percent from a year ago and at the lowest dollar level since second quarter 2001.
Business Segment Performance
      Wells Fargo has three lines of business for management reporting: Community Banking, Wholesale Banking and Wells Fargo Financial. Net income for each was:
      More financial information about the business segments is on pages 25 and 26.
       
      
Community Banking
offers a complete line of diversified financial products and services for consumers and small businesses including investment, insurance and trust services primarily in 23 midwestern and western states, and mortgage and home equity loans in all 50 states.
 
      Community Banking reported net income of $1,316 million in second quarter 2004, compared with $1,059 million for the same period of 2003, up 24 percent. Second quarter revenue grew 6 percent compared with the same period of 2003. Net interest income increased by $124 million, compared with second quarter 2003, primarily due to growth in consumer and 1-4 family loans and deposits, partially offset by a decrease in mortgages held for sale and a decline in the net interest margin. Noninterest income was up $173 million in second quarter 2004, compared with the same period last year. Noninterest expense decreased by $74 million in second quarter 2004, or 2 percent, compared with the same period of 2003, due primarily to a decline in mortgage origination volumes.
      "Our experienced and dedicated sales team continued to achieve record sales," said John Stumpf, Group EVP, Community Banking. "Core product sales were 3.45 million for the second quarter, up 16 percent from the same period last year. The number of retail bankers increased by 1,600, up 17 percent from last June, while we maintained our strong sales efficiency at 4.9 core sales per platform banker per day. We've begun to see some growth in business lending (commercial and commercial real estate loans). Total business loans increased 9 percent from a year ago and loans to small businesses with annual revenues of $2 million or less increased 17 percent compared with the same period a year ago. Our business card programs are growing quickly with 344,000 credit cards and 680,000 debit cards outstanding at quarter end, increases of 19 percent and 34 percent respectively, compared with a year ago."
      "Residential real estate originations for the quarter were $96 billion, up $31 billion from the first quarter," said Mark Oman, Group EVP, Home and Consumer Finance. "With higher interest rates during the quarter, application activity dropped to $100 billion. Reflecting the decline in applications, the mortgage application pipeline ended the quarter at $57 billion, down $15 billion from March 31, 2004, although purchase mortgage volume remained at or above expectations."
      The owned servicing portfolio grew to $749 billion, up $116 billion, or 18 percent, from the same period last year. The weighted-average note rate declined to 5.75 percent. The carrying value of the mortgage servicing rights at June 30, 2004 was $8.5 billion, 1.37 percent of loans serviced for others, compared with $6.9 billion, or 1.15 percent of loans serviced for others, at year-end 2003.
 
      
Wholesale Banking
provides businesses across the United States predominantly with annual sales in excess of $10 million with a complete line of commercial, corporate, treasury management, investment, insurance brokerage, capital markets and real estate banking products and services.
      Wholesale Banking reported net income of $385 million in second quarter 2004, compared with $345 million in second quarter 2003, an increase of 12 percent. Net income was $833 million for the first six months of 2004, compared with $693 million for the first six months of 2003, an increase of 20 percent. Revenue increased 5 percent to $1,279 million and 10 percent to $2,669 million in the second quarter 2004 and first six months of 2004, respectively. Second quarter 2004 expenses were up 4 percent from the prior year and down 1 percent (unannualized) on a linked-quarter basis. The 2004 results have particularly benefited from strength in asset-based lending and capital markets-related businesses.
      "We're pleased to report a double-digit increase for earnings compared with the same period a year ago," said Dave Hoyt, Group EVP, Wholesale Banking. "We're particularly encouraged by our $1.8 billion increase in average commercial loans for the quarter, an increase of 14 percent (annualized) from the prior quarter, accelerating from the 5 percent year-over-year growth. Although this is the first quarter in three years that we have seen significant loan growth, the breadth and depth of our financial solutions for clients has enabled us to generate strong revenue and earnings growth during the challenging economic conditions of the past few years."
      One of Wells Fargo's ten strategic initiatives is to grow the investment businesses. During the quarter, the Company announced the purchase of $27 billion in mutual fund assets and $7 billion in institutional investment accounts from Strong Financial. "We're very excited about expanding our investment products and capabilities with Strong," said Hoyt. "Team members from Wells Fargo and Strong have put a lot of hard work into making the acquisition a success and we believe this is a great strategic fit of investment talent, new distribution channels and outstanding products." The asset management businesses of Strong Financial include 70 mutual funds and serve over 870,000 active accounts. The acquisition is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2005.
 
      
Wells Fargo Financial
offers consumer and commercial finance, leasing, private label credit cards and dealer financing in 47 states, Canada, and the Caribbean.
      "Our growth validates our business model and shows that customers respond to our commitment to helping them succeed financially by rewarding us with their business," said Tom Shippee, President and CEO of Wells Fargo Financial. "With year-to-date receivables growth of $4.8 billion at the end of second quarter, we've surpassed $29.4 billion in receivables outstanding, an increase of nearly $9.4 billion, or 46 percent, over the last 12 months. Reflecting continued growth in receivables, we increased our loan loss provision by $50 million above net charge-offs, which reduced net income by $32 million after-tax.
