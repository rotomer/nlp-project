Year 2004 Highlights:
Fourth Quarter 2004 Highlights:
 
SAN FRANCISCO  Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) reported record diluted earnings per common share (EPS) of $4.09 for 2004, compared with $3.65 in 2003, up 12 percent. Net income was a record $7.0 billion, up 13 percent from $6.2 billion in 2003. For fourth quarter 2004, net income was a record $1.8 billion, or $1.04 per share, compared with $1.6 billion, or $.95 per share, for fourth quarter 2003, an increase in earnings per share of 10 percent.
      "This was another exceptional year for our company, among the very best not just in financial services but in any industry, with record diluted earnings per share of $4.09, record net income of $7.0 billion and solid market share growth across our more than 80 businesses," said Chairman and CEO Dick Kovacevich. "Because these results would not have been possible without the customer focus and dedication of our exceptional team, today we're announcing a special contribution of Wells Fargo common stock to the 401(k) Plan for eligible team members, equaling one percent of a team member's pay, up to a maximum contribution of $750, totaling $44 million.
      Combined revenue in all of our businesses other than Wells Fargo Home Mortgage (Home Mortgage), which had extraordinary revenue in 2003 due to the refinance boom, grew 11 percent this year - 6 percent including Home Mortgage. In addition to double-digit growth in EPS, we also had double-digit growth in loans and retail core deposits and continued strong credit quality for the year. Even more remarkable, our company has been achieving outstanding results not just for one, two or even five years, as many admired companies have done, but for the past 20 years, through many different economic cycles. In fact, due to our consistent vision, strong culture and time-tested business model, our annual compound growth over the past 20 years has averaged 13 percent in revenue and averaged 14 percent in diluted EPS, and our total annual compound stockholder return has been 23 percent compared with 13 percent for the S&P 500. Our total annual stockholder return has been about 10 percentage points above the S&P 500 for each of the past five, ten, 15 and 20 year periods.
      We have a 20-year history of investing in our company, and 2004 was one of our highest investment years ever. You must reinvest to consistently grow profit and revenue at double-digit rates for 20 years. We achieved record results while making very significant investments throughout the year to benefit the future, including opening 177 new stores, increasing the number of team members serving our customers by over 5,000, adding Wells Fargo stock to every eligible team member's 401(k) account to thank them for all their efforts, making significant incremental investments in electronic imaging, call centers and other technology projects, integrating acquisitions, and improving future margins by incurring the costs of extinguishing high interest rate debt and selling low interest rate assets. We continued to support our communities by taking a $217 million charitable contribution expense in the fourth quarter, to be funded by tax-advantaged venture capital gains, helping ensure that our Foundation remains well funded for eight to ten years.
      In 2004, we became one of the nation's 20 largest mutual fund companies with the acquisition of $29 billion in assets under management from Strong Financial Corporation (Strong Financial). Our stock hit a record high close of $63.25 last month. Our solid financial performance enables us to be one of the top givers to non-profits among all U.S. companies. We continue to be the only Aaa' rated bank in the U.S., the highest possible credit rating. We begin 2005 with good earnings momentum in our major businesses."
 
Financial Performance
      "Our financial results for 2004 were outstanding and continued in the fourth quarter with strong earnings per share and accelerated revenue growth," said Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins. "Earnings growth was broad based across our businesses led by strong growth in consumer lending, deposits, asset management, commercial lending and consumer finance, and solid results from Home Mortgage."
      During fourth quarter 2004, the Company made a special 401(k) contribution of $44 million ($.02 EPS) in recognition of our team members' outstanding performance. In addition, the Company recorded a $217 million ($.08 EPS) charitable contribution expense that is projected to leave the Wells Fargo Foundation well funded for the next eight to ten years. As previously announced, the Company also incurred $19 million ($.01 EPS) in integration expense related to the closing of the Strong Financial transaction in fourth quarter 2004. In 2005, the Company expects integration expense of approximately $.02 per share for the balance of the Strong Financial transaction and for the pending acquisition of Houston-based First Community Capital Corporation. "Although we believe that stock options should not be treated as an expense," said Atkins, "we will expense stock options as required, beginning July 1, 2005. Using the modified prospective' method of adoption, we estimate the effect of expensing current outstanding options will reduce earnings by three cents per share for the last half of 2005."
Revenue
      Revenue of $8.2 billion for fourth quarter 2004 grew $723 million, or 10 percent, from a year ago. "Revenue growth was broad based, with particularly strong growth in consumer lending, deposits, small business banking, credit and debit cards, consumer finance, market-sensitive revenues and mortgage banking," said Atkins.
      Full-year 2004 revenue of $30 billion - a new record - grew 6 percent from 2003 despite a 37 percent decrease in mortgage originations as the refinance driven market declined from its exceptional 2003 level. Balance sheet repositioning actions during the year, designed to improve earning asset yields and to reduce long-term debt costs, reduced annual revenue growth by approximately one percentage point. For the year, Home Mortgage revenue declined $807 million, or 16 percent, from $5.2 billion in 2003 to $4.4 billion in 2004. Combined revenue of businesses other than Home Mortgage grew 11 percent in 2004 from 2003. On a linked-quarter basis, consolidated revenue increased $850 million, or 12 percent, due to particularly strong growth in trust and investments, consumer loan fees, mortgage banking, equity investments, trading and other capital market activities.
Loans
      Average loans of $281.2 billion in fourth quarter 2004 increased 19 percent from $236.0 billion in fourth quarter 2003, and $6.9 billion, or 10 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis. Average commercial and commercial real estate loans increased $8.6 billion, or 10 percent, from fourth quarter 2003, and loan growth accelerated to 13 percent (annualized), up $3.1 billion, on a linked-quarter basis.
      "For the third straight quarter, commercial loan growth was broad based across virtually all of our businesses, including small business direct, middle market, commercial real estate, leasing, trade finance and asset-based lending," said Atkins. "We also saw continued
 
strong demand for consumer credit," said Atkins. Average consumer loans increased $34.9 billion, or 24 percent, from fourth quarter 2003, and $3.3 billion, or 7 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis. Most of the difference between the linked-quarter and year-over-year growth in both total and consumer loans was due to sales of lower yielding adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs). Home equity, credit card, revolving credit and installment loans grew solidly in fourth quarter 2004.
Deposits
      Average core deposits of $230.2 billion for fourth quarter 2004 grew $20.2 billion, or 10 percent, from fourth quarter 2003, and increased $5.2 billion, or 9 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis. Average mortgage escrow deposits were $14.5 billion for fourth quarter 2004, essentially unchanged from fourth quarter 2003 and third quarter 2004. Average retail core deposits for fourth quarter 2004 grew 10 percent from fourth quarter 2003 and 8 percent (annualized) on a linked-quarter basis. Average consumer checking account balances for fourth quarter 2004 grew 11 percent from fourth quarter 2003.
Net Interest Income
      Net interest income for fourth quarter 2004 increased 10 percent from a year ago. Earning assets for the fourth quarter were up 12 percent from a year ago due to the 19 percent growth in average loans. On a linked-quarter basis, net interest income was up $38 million, or 3 percent (annualized), driven by a 4 percent (annualized) increase in earning assets.
      "Earning asset growth on a linked-quarter basis was below our solid 10 percent (annualized) loan growth due to a $2.5 billion decline in average mortgages held for sale and a $1.3 billion decline in average debt securities available for sale," said Atkins. The fourth quarter net interest margin remained essentially flat linked-quarter at 4.88 percent in part due to the positive impact of the balance sheet repositioning in 2004. At December 31, 2004, the Company had $1.4 billion in unrealized gains on securities available for sale, unchanged from September 30, 2004.
Noninterest Income
      Noninterest income increased $311 million, or 9 percent, from fourth quarter 2003. "The increase in fee income was driven by growth across our businesses, with particular strength in consumer loans, trust and investments, credit and debit cards, mortgage banking, equity investments and trading activities on behalf of our customers," said Atkins. These same businesses led to an increase in noninterest income of $812 million, or 28 percent, on a linked-quarter basis. Mortgage banking servicing fees in fourth quarter 2004 included $234 million from a mortgage servicing rights valuation reserve release offset by $189 million of ineffective hedge losses. Despite the reserve release, mortgage servicing rights were valued at 1.15 percent of loans serviced for others, down from 1.18 percent at September 30, 2004.
Noninterest Expense
      Noninterest expense was up $471 million, or 10 percent, from fourth quarter 2003 and $751 million, or 18 percent, on a linked-quarter basis. These increases were primarily due to the $217 million charitable contribution expense, the $44 million special 401(k) contribution, the $19 million Strong Financial integration expense, growth in stores and team members, and a step-up in technology investments for electronic imaging, call centers and other activities in the fourth quarter.
 
      "Despite the balance sheet repositioning actions taken during the year, which reduced revenue by approximately one percent, and our significant level of investment spending, which will benefit sales and revenue growth going forward, operating leverage improved during 2004 with consolidated revenue growing six percent and consolidated expense up only two percent, including all investment spending," said Atkins.
Credit Quality
      "Fourth quarter credit results were consistent with our expectations," said Chief Credit Officer Dave Munio. "Credit losses in the fourth quarter were $465 million (.66 percent of average loans outstanding, annualized), flat to the $465 million (.78 percent) losses a year ago despite a $45 billion increase in average total loans. Total credit losses and loss rates were up from third quarter's $407 million (.59 percent) due to the expected seasoning in the high-growth consumer portfolios at Wells Fargo Financial and Community Banking." Total consumer credit loss rates for fourth quarter 2004 were .75 percent, up from .67 percent in third quarter 2004, but down from .91 percent in fourth quarter 2003. The credit loss rate for junior lien mortgages (second mortgage home equity loans and lines) was 19 basis points in fourth quarter 2004, up from 12 basis points in third quarter 2004, but down from 25 basis points in fourth quarter 2003. "The fourth quarter 2004 loss rates in our consumer portfolios were within our expected normal range of losses and reflected the anticipated seasoning of high-growth portfolios," said Munio.
      "Our credit losses for full-year 2004 were below 2003 and flat compared with 2002 despite significant loan portfolio growth," said Munio. Credit losses for 2004 were $1.67 billion (.62 percent) compared with $1.72 billion (.81 percent) in 2003 and $1.68 billion (.96 percent) for 2002. "The majority of our loan growth was driven by consumer real estate, which inherently has lower losses that emerge over a longer time frame compared with other consumer products," he said. "We expect to see total credit losses increase in 2005 due to the seasoning of these portfolios and modest growth in our middle-market Wholesale Banking portfolios. Fourth quarter provision for credit losses matched net charge-offs. We believe the allowance was adequate for losses inherent in the loan portfolios at year-end 2004."
      "Total nonperforming assets remained stable," said Munio. At December 31, 2004, they totaled $1.57 billion, or .55 percent of total loans, compared with $1.57 billion (.56 percent) last quarter. "Wholesale Banking nonperformers continued to decline and were down over $300 million during 2004," continued Munio. "Offsetting this decline was an anticipated increase in consumer nonperformers, where nonperforming status is determined by certain delinquency limits, in our auto and real estate portfolios. These consumer nonperformers have limited loss content based on the strength of the underlying collateral. Consumer delinquencies remained consistent with our credit models, and Wells Fargo's losses have followed the national trend of lower consumer bankruptcies during 2004."
 
Business Segment Performance
      Wells Fargo has three lines of business for management reporting: Community Banking, Wholesale Banking and Wells Fargo Financial. Net income of the three business segments was:
      More financial information about the business segments is on pages 27 and 28.
Community Banking
offers a complete line of diversified financial products and services for consumers and small businesses including investment, insurance and trust services primarily in 23 midwestern and western states, and mortgage and home equity loans in all 50 states.
      Community Banking reported record net income of $4,967 million for 2004, up 14 percent over 2003. "This outstanding performance was largely due to record core product sales, market share growth across our businesses and the continued exceptional performance of our team members," said John Stumpf, Group EVP, Community Banking.
      Average loans were $187.0 billion in 2004, up 31 percent from $143.2 billion in 2003. Retail core deposits averaged $183.7 billion in 2004, up 11 percent over the prior year. Revenue in businesses other than Home Mortgage rose 10 percent on higher fee revenue, including deposit service charges, trust and investments, debit and credit cards and insurance. Home Mortgage revenue decreased from 2003, a year of record originations from strong refinancing activity. While total Community Banking noninterest expense included additional investments made in technology, store growth and additional team members, total noninterest expense decreased $137 million, or 1 percent, due to overall expense management, including a reduction in Home Mortgage production costs.
      For fourth quarter 2004, Community Banking reported net income of $1,238 million, compared with $1,182 million in fourth quarter 2003. Revenue increased 10 percent to $5,927 million in fourth quarter 2004 from the same period in 2003, primarily due to higher
 
trust and investment fees, credit and debit card revenue, mortgage banking and other fees. Noninterest expense was $3,814 million in fourth quarter 2004, an increase of $429 million from fourth quarter 2003, and included the $217 million charitable contribution expense, the special 401(k) contribution, as well as expenditures to support technology investments and store growth.
Regional Banking Highlights
      "Our talented, motivated and engaged team members achieved record annual core sales in 2004, up 18 percent from 2003, including selling more than one million core products each month during the year, another record," said Carrie Tolstedt, Group EVP, Regional Banking. "And, one in three of new checking account customers now has a  a checking account and at least three other products. This is up from 25 percent in 2003. As a result of strong sales, customer cross-sell reached a record high of 4.6 products per consumer, up from about three in 1998. The number of products sold is important, but even more significant is that our average household profit was up 17 percent from 2003. We invested throughout the year in our business to better serve our customers and generate future growth. We opened 104 new banking stores, added 1,800 retail bankers, and doubled the number of licensed bankers. Our team members are energized to serve our customers, with team member engagement scores now in the 70th percentile in the Gallup data base, up from the 56th percentile in 2003. And, in 2004, customer retention for high value customers improved by six percent."

Internet Highlights
      Wells Fargo continued to be recognized as the best internet bank and received awards from as the "Best Consumer Online Bill Payment & Presentment" in the world, "Best Consumer Online Credit" in North America and "Best Corporation/Institutional Web Site Design" in North America. Additionally, we were ranked the "Number one Internet bank" on Watchfire GmezPro's Online Banker Scorecard.

      Active internet customers increased to 6.2 million, up 27 percent from 2003, and an industry-leading 51 percent penetration of our consumer checking accounts. Online bill pay customers increased 35 percent to 2.2 million. Online consumer product sales increased 42 percent.
 
Home Mortgage and Home Equity Highlights
      "We are very pleased with the overall performance and execution of our home financing businesses in 2004," said Mark Oman, Group EVP, Home and Consumer Finance. "We saw very strong loan growth with the first mortgage portfolio up 5 percent to $87.7 billion and the second mortgage portfolio up 42 percent to $52.2 billion. With lower refinancing demand in 2004, residential mortgage originations of $298 billion were down 37 percent from the industry record of $470 billion we established in 2003. Nevertheless, in 2004, we saw the benefit of our balanced business model at Home Mortgage, which includes both our residential mortgage servicing business and our residential mortgage origination business. As refinance originations moderated, so did prepayments of our servicing portfolio, resulting in significantly improved servicing profitability."
      The owned servicing portfolio, including commercial mortgages, grew to a record $805 billion at December 31, 2004, up $95 billion, or 13 percent, from December 31, 2003. The carrying value of mortgage servicing rights at year-end was $7.9 billion, 1.15 percent of loans serviced for others, compared with $6.9 billion, 1.15 percent of loans serviced for others at year-end 2003 and $7.8 billion, 1.18 percent of loans serviced for others at September 30, 2004. The weighted-average note rate declined 15 basis points in 2004 to end the year at 5.75 percent.
      The Company retained the number one market share in home equity in the U.S. for the fourth consecutive year. The home equity portfolio continued to perform better than expected with an average FICO score in the low 720s and an average combined loan to value of 70 percent assuming the entire equity line is drawn down.
Wholesale Banking
provides businesses across the United States predominantly with annual sales in excess of $10 million with a complete line of commercial, corporate, treasury management, investment, insurance, capital markets and real estate banking products and services.
 
      Wholesale Banking reported record net income of $1,599 million in 2004, an increase of 11 percent over 2003. Average loans rose 7 percent to $53.1 billion in 2004 from $49.5 billion in 2003. The quality of Wholesale Banking's loan portfolio improved as reflected in a lower level of nonperforming loans and a decrease in net credit losses from the prior year. The provision for credit losses was $62 million in 2004, compared with $177 million a year earlier. Noninterest income was $3,070 million in 2004, compared with $2,766 million in 2003, an increase of 11 percent. The increase in noninterest income included higher fee revenue, insurance brokerage and capital markets activity.
      For fourth quarter 2004, Wholesale Banking net income was $403 million, compared with $382 million in fourth quarter 2003. Average loans increased 13 percent to $56.4 billion in fourth quarter 2004 from the prior year. Wholesale Banking's fourth quarter 2004 results included a lower level of credit losses, higher capital markets activity and integration charges associated with the Strong Financial transaction.
      "We are very pleased with our results for 2004," said Dave Hoyt, Group EVP, Wholesale Banking. "Our net income increased 11 percent on a year over year basis. Our team achieved its third consecutive quarter of solid loan growth after a period of virtually flat loan balances for three years. Our businesses delivered double-digit noninterest income growth year over year. We continued to generate growth through solid new customer relationships and our focus on cross sell. We also benefited from exceptionally strong credit results. Wholesale Banking has delivered record profits for six consecutive years and during that time we have grown at a 12 percent compound rate. We're particularly proud of these long term results as they include a number of years when the economy was very difficult. The acquisition of assets under management from Strong Financial closed at year-end 2004. We have hired 650 of the former Strong Financial employees in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin and substantially all of the portfolio managers. Wells Fargo mutual funds now total $100 billion in assets under management making us one of the top 20 mutual fund companies in the country."
      
Wells Fargo Financial
offers consumer installment and home equity lending, automobile financing, consumer and private-label credit cards and commercial services to consumers and businesses throughout the United States, and in Canada, Latin America, the Caribbean, Guam and Saipan.
 
      Wells Fargo Financial reported record net income of $507 million in 2004, up 12 percent from $451 million in 2003. The 2004 results reflected a strong increase in real estate secured loans and auto lending, as average loans reached $29.5 billion, an increase of 45 percent over the prior year. Total revenue rose 18 percent in 2004, reaching $3,178 million, compared with $2,689 million in 2003 on higher net interest income. Wells Fargo Financial's provision for credit losses was $797 million in 2004, up from $623 million in 2003, reflecting the overall increase in loans and expected seasoning in the loan portfolio. Noninterest expense was $1,590 million in 2004, up from $1,343 million in 2003, reflecting investments in new consumer finance stores and additional team members.
      For fourth quarter 2004, Wells Fargo Financial's net income was $129 million, compared with $119 million in the same period of 2003, an increase of 8 percent. The fourth quarter 2004 results reflected a 17 percent increase in revenue, primarily in net interest income due to a 41 percent increase in average loans, partially offset by a higher level of noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. Average loans were $33.1 billion in fourth quarter 2004 compared with $23.5 billion in fourth quarter 2003.
      "Our receivables growth of $9.7 billion in 2004 was driven primarily by real estate-secured lending receivables growth of $5.1 billion and auto lending receivables growth of $3.3 billion," said Tom Shippee, president and CEO of Wells Fargo Financial. "We opened 73 consumer stores and increased our team member total 16 percent. The growth of our business  surpassing half a billion dollars in net earnings for the first time  is the result of our continued investment in the business. We also invested in the systems, governance and infrastructure needed to support our continued asset growth. Losses have increased consistent with the loan growth and product mix. We have maintained consistent credit quality standards and expect a measured increase in losses as the various loan portfolios season. Loss rates by product remained within acceptable and anticipated ranges."
