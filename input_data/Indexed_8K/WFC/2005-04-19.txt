Exhibit 99
First Quarter 2005 Highlights:
 
SAN FRANCISCO  Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) reported record diluted earnings per common share of $1.08 for first quarter 2005, compared with $1.03 in first quarter 2004, up 5 percent. Net income was a record $1.86 billion, up 5 percent from $1.77 billion in first quarter 2004.
"This was another outstanding, record-breaking quarter with double-digit growth in loans, double-digit growth in revenue, the single most important measure of Wells Fargo's long-term success, continued strengthening of our already strong balance sheet and solid profit performance throughout all our major business groups," said Chairman and CEO Dick Kovacevich. "Our 153,000 talented team members continued to increase market share by satisfying the financial needs of our more than 23 million customers and earning more of their business. Our credit quality continued to be excellent and among the very best in our industry, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. remained the only U.S. bank with the highest possible credit rating, Aaa.' Continuing the pace of last year's store expansion, we opened 15 new banking stores during the quarter. New government data shows we've widened our lead as the nation's #1 lender to small-business owners, and we're also #1 in lending to small businesses in low-to-moderate income neighborhoods for loans less than $1 million. magazine named Wells Fargo one of the nation's top 10 corporate citizens among all industries, and we were only the second company, ever, to receive the United Way of America's highest possible recognition  all four of its Summit awards for corporate community involvement."
Business Ethics
Diluted earnings per share were a record $1.08, up 5 percent from $1.03 in first quarter 2004 and up 15 percent (annualized) from $1.04 in fourth quarter 2004. "Profit growth continued to be broad based across our businesses, with particular strength in regional banking, mortgage, consumer finance, institutional investment management, and large corporate banking  all of which had either double-digit revenue growth, double-digit profit growth, or both," said Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins.
Financial Performance
First quarter results included pre-tax charges or losses of $410 million for several actions designed to further strengthen the Company's balance sheet. First, in a step toward bringing the Company's mortgage, home equity and consumer finance businesses onto common systems and conforming credit charge-off practices with the more stringent standards of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), Wells Fargo Financial recognized $163 million in credit losses in its portfolios. Second, the Company incurred $117 million in expenses upon shortening the estimated lives of certain depreciable assets. Finally, the Company realized $130 million of losses related to the sale of $18 billion of its lowest-yielding adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) and auto loans.
Revenue of $8.1 billion for first quarter 2005 grew $942 million, or 13 percent, from a year ago. "Reflecting the strength and breadth of our business model, revenue growth was broad based, with particularly strong double-digit growth in regional banking, institutional investments, debit cards, small business lending, insurance, corporate trust, consumer credit, consumer finance, home mortgage and corporate banking," said Atkins.
Revenue
Despite the sale of $35 billion in ARMs and auto loans since first quarter 2004, average loans of $287.3 billion increased $30.8 billion, or 12 percent, from first quarter 2004, and $6.1 billion, or 9 percent (annualized), from fourth quarter 2004. Average commercial and
Loans
 
commercial real estate loans increased $10.9 billion, or 12 percent, from first quarter 2004. Total commercial loan growth accelerated to 15 percent (annualized), up $3.7 billion on a linked-quarter basis. Commercial loans grew across virtually all customer segments, including double-digit increases, both linked-quarter (annualized) and year-over-year in small business direct, middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate and asset-based lending.
"The commercial lending market remained competitive, but we continue to build volume by adding new customers and expanding relationships with existing customers," said Atkins. "As a result, commercial loans have grown at a double-digit rate for two consecutive quarters. Consumer loan growth also remained very strong despite some reduction in growth from last year's record pace." Average consumer loans increased 11 percent from first quarter 2004 and 5 percent (annualized) on a linked-quarter basis. Loan sales reduced year-over-year and linked-quarter consumer loan growth by 50 percent each.
Average core deposits of $231.8 billion grew $18.7 billion, or 9 percent, from first quarter 2004, and increased $1.6 billion on a linked-quarter basis. Average consumer checking account balances grew 9 percent from first quarter 2004 and 7 percent (annualized) on a linked-quarter basis, reflecting a 5.5 percent net increase in consumer checking accounts from a year ago and higher average balances per account.
Deposits
Net interest income increased 10 percent from a year ago and was essentially flat on a linked-quarter basis. "The double-digit year-over-year increase in net interest income was driven by a 12 percent increase in earning assets," said Atkins. "The impact on earning assets and net interest income from double-digit customer loan growth was moderated by the sale of $35 billion of our lowest-yielding, shorter duration ARMs and auto loans. During the past twelve months, we had unusually good market opportunities to improve asset yields and margins by selling our lowest-yielding loans. The note rates at which we are now beginning to replace these ARMs through new originations are 80-90 basis points higher than the note rates on the ARMs sold during the past twelve months." The yield on the Company's first mortgage portfolio increased to 6.0 percent at quarter end from 5.3 percent a year ago and 5.7 percent in fourth quarter 2004. At March 31, 2005, the Company had $930 million in unrealized gains on securities available for sale.
Net Interest Income
Noninterest income increased $539 million, or 17 percent, from first quarter 2004. "The double-digit increase in fee income was broad based across our businesses, with growth particularly high in trust and investments, credit and debit cards, consumer loans and mortgage banking," said Atkins. Substantially all of the increase in trust and investment fees was due to the acquisition of assets under management from Strong Financial Corporation (Strong), which closed December 31, 2004. Mortgage banking results reflected higher income from both servicing and mortgage loan originations and sales compared with first quarter 2004. Net mortgage banking servicing fees were $456 million, up $290 million from $166 million in first quarter 2004. Servicing fees included $271 million from a mortgage servicing rights valuation reserve release and $85 million of net derivative gains from hedging mortgage servicing rights, compared with a $400 million provision expense which increased the mortgage servicing rights valuation reserve and $538 million of net derivative gains in first quarter 2004. The valuation allowance had a
Noninterest Income
 
balance of $1.3 billion at March 31, 2005, and mortgage servicing rights were valued at 1.24 percent of loans serviced for others, up from 1.15 percent at December 31, 2004.
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income was down $76 million, with fee income growth in our business segments more than offset by the impact of the balance sheet repositioning actions, which reduced noninterest income by $130 million.
Noninterest expense was up $663 million from first quarter 2004 and down $279 million on a linked-quarter basis. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a $332 million increase in salary and benefit expense from adding 7,100 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, largely sales people, across the Company's businesses. Higher occupancy and equipment costs reflected a $117 million expense incurred during first quarter 2005 to adjust the estimated lives for certain depreciable assets, primarily building improvements. The Strong transaction added about $74 million of noninterest expense, including $8 million of integration costs. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense declined $279 million due primarily to the $217 million charitable contribution expense taken in fourth quarter 2004.
Noninterest Expense
"We continued to experience historically low loss rates in most of our wholesale business units, and our consumer credit loss rates remained stable and at the lower end of historic ranges," said Chief Credit Officer Dave Munio. Total first quarter net credit losses were $585 million (.83 percent of average loans outstanding, annualized), including $163 million (.23 percent) related to the timing of credit loss recognition at Wells Fargo Financial upon adoption of FFIEC guidelines, compared with $465 million (.66 percent) in fourth quarter 2004 and $404 million (.63 percent) in first quarter 2004. "Unlike our banks, Wells Fargo Financial is not subject to FFIEC guidelines, but we believe these are sound business practices that will also provide consistent loss recognition across all Wells Fargo business units," said Munio.
Credit Quality
Total nonperforming assets (NPAs) declined $206 million, or 13 percent, from March 31, 2004 and $167 million, or 11 percent, from December 31, 2004. NPAs were $1.41 billion, or .48 percent of total loans, at March 31, 2005, compared with $1.57 billion (.55 percent) at year-end 2004 and $1.61 billion (.61 percent) at March 31, 2004. The $167 million decline in NPAs from December 31, 2004 primarily reflected lower consumer NPAs due to the impact of the higher charge-offs at Wells Fargo Financial to conform its credit write-off practices with FFIEC standards and the continued decline in commercial NPAs due to overall economic improvements.
At March 31, 2005, the allowance for credit losses was $3.95 billion, unchanged from year-end 2004, and represented over two times coverage for estimated annual loan losses. "We consider the allowance at quarter end to be adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolios," said Munio.

"The outstanding results in Community Banking are the direct result of the continued customer focus and hard work of our dedicated team members," said John Stumpf, Group EVP, Community Banking. "Through their efforts, we've been delivering consistent results thanks to their ability to do what's right for our customers."
Community Banking reported record net income of $1.40 billion, up 19 percent from first quarter 2004. Net interest income increased $275 million, or 10 percent, compared with first quarter 2004, due primarily to growth in consumer loans and deposits, and mortgages held for sale. Noninterest income increased $532 million, or 25 percent, compared with first quarter 2004, due primarily to increased mortgage banking revenue and higher card fees, loan fees and other income. Noninterest expense was $3.51 billion, up $513 million from first quarter 2004, due to an increase in the number of team members and a $117 million charge taken in first quarter 2005 to shorten the estimated lives of certain depreciable assets. The first quarter provision for credit losses decreased $11 million, or 5 percent, from first quarter 2004. Average loans were $192.6 billion, up 7 percent from a year ago. Core deposits averaged $206.2 billion, up 10 percent over the prior year.

"Home Mortgage saw a strong pick-up in application activity in the quarter, as applications of $91 billion increased 14 percent over fourth quarter 2004, and the March 31, 2005 pipeline of $59 billion was up 18 percent from year-end," said Mark Oman, Group EVP, Home and Consumer Finance. "The rise in interest rates during the quarter and the growth in the servicing portfolio resulted in an increase in the mortgage servicing rights asset to $9.0 billion, or 1.24 percent of loans serviced for others, up from $7.9 billion, or 1.15 percent, at year-end. Reflecting the increase in fair value of the servicing asset, a $271 million reversal of the valuation allowance was realized in the quarter."
Home equity loans were $53.9 billion at quarter end, up 34 percent from first quarter 2004. The credit quality of this portfolio remained very strong, with nonaccrual loans of $101 million, or .2 percent of the portfolio.
