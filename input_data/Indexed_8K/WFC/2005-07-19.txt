Exhibit 99
Second Quarter 2005 Highlights:
 
SAN FRANCISCO  Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) reported record diluted earnings per common share of $1.12 for second quarter 2005, up 12 percent from $1.00 in second quarter 2004. Net income was a record $1.91 billion, up 11 percent from $1.71 billion in second quarter 2004. For the first half of 2005, diluted earnings per share were $2.20 and net income was $3.77 billion, both up 8 percent from the first half of 2004.
"Thanks to the outstanding efforts of our more than 150,000 talented team members, this was another exceptional quarter of broad-based growth across our more than 80 businesses with continued double-digit growth in profit and earnings per share," said Chairman and CEO Dick Kovacevich. "To satisfy all our customers' financial needs and help them succeed financially, we continue to invest for future market share growth. During the first half of this year, for example, we opened 28 banking stores and added 22 mortgage stores, seven consumer finance stores and four regional commercial banking offices. We merged  and , creating , the nation's 20th-largest mutual fund company, managing more than $100 billion in assets, with 120 funds spanning all asset classes and investment styles. We also announced new low- and no-cost online stock and mutual fund commissions to benefit our most loyal customers. To be the financial services company of choice for Latino customers, we expanded our remittance services beyond Mexico into El Salvador and Guatemala. Our bank remained the nation's only Aaa' credit-rated bank, and we continued to earn more recognition for our corporate citizenship. magazine ranked us among the nation's top 10 corporate citizens and the United Way of America recognized us with its top four awards for community involvement, only the second company in history to receive all four awards in one year."

Diluted earnings per share were a record $1.12, up 12 percent from $1.00 in second quarter 2004 and up 15 percent (annualized) from $1.08 in first quarter 2005. "We're very pleased with yet another quarter of consistent, double-digit earnings growth," said Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins. "We continued to have strong growth in loans and core deposits, revenue growth again exceeded expense growth, credit quality remained exceptional, and our net interest margin - already one of the highest in the industry - improved further in the quarter. These outstanding results again demonstrate the value of having and successfully executing one of the most diverse business models in financial services. Despite a $559 million decline in revenue from Wells Fargo Home Mortgage (Home Mortgage) largely related to normal servicing revaluation, overall company earnings per share were still up 12 percent from second quarter 2004 led by double-digit revenue growth in our businesses other than Home Mortgage. We achieved particularly strong double-digit, year-over-year profit growth in regional banking, consumer finance, middle market/large corporate banking, asset-based lending, capital markets, corporate trust, international and private equity investing."
Financial Performance
Revenue of $7.9 billion grew $439 million, or 6 percent, from a year ago. Home Mortgage revenue declined $559 million, or 42 percent, from $1.3 billion in second quarter 2004 to $774 million in second quarter 2005. Combined revenue of businesses other than Home Mortgage grew 16 percent in second quarter 2005 from second quarter 2004. "Revenue growth was broad based across most of our businesses and reflected solid growth in both net interest income and noninterest income," said Atkins.
Revenue
 
Average loans of $295.6 billion increased $29.4 billion, or 11 percent, from second quarter 2004, and $8.4 billion, or 12 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis. Average commercial and commercial real estate loans increased $11.5 billion, or 13 percent, from second quarter 2004, and $2.9 billion, or 12 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit, linked-quarter growth.
Loans
"Commercial loans grew across virtually all of our customer segments, including both year-over-year and linked-quarter (annualized) double-digit increases in small business direct, SBA lending, middle market, real estate and asset-based lending," said Atkins.
Consumer loan growth remained strong with average consumer loans up 9 percent from second quarter 2004 and up 12 percent (annualized) on a linked-quarter basis. Consumer loans at June 30, 2005 were up $7.7 billion, or 17 percent (annualized), from March 31, 2005, reflecting double-digit (annualized) growth in residential first mortgages, home equity loans and credit cards and 7 percent (annualized) growth in other revolving credit and installment loans.
Average core deposits of $238.3 billion grew $13.4 billion, or 6 percent, from second quarter 2004, and increased $6.5 billion, or 11 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis. Average mortgage escrow deposits were $16.1 billion, down $354 million from second quarter 2004 and up $2.1 billion from first quarter 2005. Average retail core deposits grew $16.2 billion, or 9 percent, from second quarter 2004 and increased $6.2 billion, or 13 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis.
Deposits
Net interest income increased 7 percent both from second quarter 2004 and on a linked-quarter basis (annualized). The year-over-year increase in net interest income reflected 6 percent earning asset growth and a 6 basis point increase in the net interest margin to 4.89 percent in second quarter 2005 from 4.83 percent a year ago. The net interest margin increased 2 basis points on a linked-quarter basis, despite a flatter yield curve. Even though the Company sold $18 billion of adjustable rate mortgages and auto loans in early 2005, earning assets grew 6 percent to $374.5 billion. "While temporarily reducing earning asset growth, previous repositioning actions contributed to the increase in the net interest margin from second quarter 2004 and on a linked-quarter basis and positions us to improve net interest income as the loans are replaced at higher yields," said Atkins. At June 30, 2005, the Company had $1.2 billion in unrealized gains on securities available for sale, up from $930 million at March 31, 2005.
Net Interest Income
Noninterest income increased $129 million, or 4 percent, from second quarter 2004. Excluding mortgage banking, noninterest income increased 14 percent from second quarter 2004. "The growth in noninterest income reflected double-digit increases in trust and investment fees, card fees, loan fees and gains from equity investments, offset by a $256 million decrease in mortgage banking noninterest income," said Atkins. Mortgage banking servicing fees in second quarter 2005 included $304 million in mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) impairment provision (reduction in mortgage banking revenue) compared with a $585 million valuation allowance release (increase in mortgage banking revenue) in second quarter 2004. During the
Noninterest Income
 
quarter, the Company recognized a net gain of $201 million from equity investments. At quarter end, the private equity portfolio had a cost basis of $1.5 billion and the $630 million public equity portfolio had unrealized gains of $261 million, up from $162 million at March 31, 2005. The debt securities portfolio had unrealized gains of $943 million at quarter-end.
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income decreased $307 million due to a $577 million decline in mortgage banking noninterest income reflecting a $304 million MSRs impairment provision recorded in the quarter compared with a $271 million MSRs valuation allowance release in the prior quarter. "The linked-quarter decline in mortgage banking noninterest income was partially offset by strong double-digit (annualized) growth in deposit fees, card fees, loan fees, insurance and gains from private equity investing," said Atkins.
Noninterest expense was up $201 million, or 5 percent, from second quarter 2004 and down $138 million, or 3 percent, on a linked-quarter basis. "We continued to invest for the future by adding stores and new sales-related team members," said Atkins.
Noninterest Expense
"Second quarter credit results were excellent," said Chief Credit Officer Dave Munio. "We have a well-diversified loan portfolio, measured by industry, geography and product type. Loans outstanding surpassed $300 billion at quarter end, an increase of $32 billion, or 12 percent, from a year ago. For our real estate loans, we underwrite the borrower, not the collateral, and the properties cover a range of locations and uses. We continually review real estate market trends and adjust our underwriting and products as market conditions change."
Credit Quality
Loss rates and nonperforming assets continued at or near historical lows. Total net credit losses were $454 million (.62 percent of average loans outstanding, annualized) compared with $585 million (.83 percent) in first quarter 2005 and $390 million (.59 percent) in second quarter 2004. Total first quarter 2005 losses included $163 million (.23 percent) related to the timing of credit loss recognition at Wells Fargo Financial upon adoption of Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) guidelines. "We continued to see very low losses in our wholesale portfolios, and consumer losses remained below long-term average rates," said Munio, "due to sound underwriting and collections practices and supported by strong collateral values and a good economy."
Total nonperforming assets (NPAs) were $1.39 billion (.46 percent of total loans) at June 30, 2005, compared with $1.41 billion (.48 percent) at March 31, 2005, and $1.62 billion (.60 percent) at June 30, 2004. "We continued to see a shift in the overall NPA composition," said Munio, "with Wholesale Banking NPAs at all-time lows and a gradual increase in consumer NPAs as our residential mortgage and auto portfolios grow and season. Delinquency rates on consumer portfolios were stable."
At June 30, 2005, the allowance for credit losses was $3.94 billion, essentially flat compared with both March 31, 2005, and year-end 2004. The allowance provided over two times annualized net credit loss coverage and covered NPAs by almost three times. "We consider the allowance adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolios at quarter end," said Munio.
 
Wells Fargo has three lines of business for management reporting: Community Banking, Wholesale Banking and Wells Fargo Financial. Net income for each was:
Business Segment Performance
More financial information about the business segments is on pages 25 and 26.
Community Banking
offers a complete line of diversified financial products and services for consumers and small businesses including investment, insurance and trust services primarily in 23 midwestern and western states, and mortgage and home equity loans in all 50 states.
Community Banking reported net income of $1.291 billion, down 4 percent from $1.338 billion in second quarter 2004. "Excluding a $559 million decline in Home Mortgage revenue, Community Banking's second quarter results were outstanding, reflecting our consistent focus on our vision of satisfying all of our customers' financial needs, and the continued dedication and hard work of our team members," said John Stumpf, Group EVP, Community Banking. Revenue grew 2 percent compared with the same period of 2004. Net interest income increased by $163 million, compared with second quarter 2004, primarily due to a higher net interest margin and strong growth in consumer loans and growth in deposits. Noninterest income was down $55 million in second quarter 2005, compared with the same period last year, due to the decline in noninterest income in Home Mortgage, which more than offset solid growth in other fee lines. Noninterest expense increased by $252 million, or 8 percent, in second quarter 2005 compared with the same period of 2004, due primarily to an increase in the number of team members.
 
Regional Banking Highlights
"Second quarter results in Regional Banking were driven by continued strong sales performance, including a 15 percent increase in core product sales," said Carrie Tolstedt, Group EVP, Regional Banking. "Small business remained a major focus for Regional Banking. Sales of store-based business solutions increased 27 percent from a year ago, a record performance. Loans to small businesses, primarily less than $100,000, grew 17 percent over the prior year. We are more than halfway toward our $1 billion lending goal to African American-owned small businesses, and on pace to meet the goal ahead of schedule."
Home Mortgage and Home Equity Highlights
"We were very pleased with the underlying performance of our residential real estate lending business," said Mark Oman, Group EVP, Home and Consumer Finance. "With lower interest rates and a strong housing market, we saw significant growth in Home Mortgage applications in the quarter. Applications of $117 billion were up 17 percent from last year and we ended the quarter with a pipeline of $73 billion, up $14 billion, or 24 percent, from March 31, 2005. Reflecting the lower mortgage interest rates at quarter end, $304 million of provision for impairment of mortgage servicing rights was recorded in the quarter compared with a $271 million release in first quarter 2005. At quarter end, the mortgage servicing rights asset was valued at $8.5 billion, or 1.12 percent of loans serviced for others, compared with $8.5 billion, or 1.37 percent at June 30, 2004 and $9.0 billion, or 1.24 percent, at March 31, 2005."
Home equity loans (1-4 family junior lien mortgages) were $56 billion at quarter end, up 26 percent from second quarter 2004. The credit quality of this portfolio remained very strong, with nonaccrual loans at $98 million, or .2 percent of the portfolio, and annualized net loss rates of 16 basis points, compared with 19 basis points in second quarter 2004 and 20 basis points in first quarter 2005.

Wholesale Banking
serves customers coast to coast
including middle market banking, corporate banking, commercial real estate, treasury management, asset-based lending, insurance brokerage, foreign exchange, trade services, specialized lending, equipment finance, capital markets activities, and institutional investments.
Wholesale Banking reported net income of $462 million, up 20 percent from a year ago and up 9 percent from first quarter 2005. Revenue was $1,459 million, up 14 percent from $1,279 million in second quarter 2004, driven by continued strength in capital markets activities including realized gains in bonds and equities and the effect of the Strong Financial transaction. Noninterest expense was up 13 percent from the prior year, primarily due to the Strong Financial transaction. Average loans increased 18 percent to $61.3 billion from second quarter 2004, with double-digit loan growth across all wholesale lending businesses.
"We're very pleased with our second quarter results, with double-digit, year-over-year increases in both revenue and net income," said Dave Hoyt, Group EVP, Wholesale Banking. "We continued to focus on building new relationships, deepening relationships through cross-sell and improving customer satisfaction. We grew our wholesale businesses by delivering a broad product line to our customers and opening new wholesale offices in Atlanta, Cleveland, Hartford, Indianapolis and Tampa.
We achieved solid loan growth of 18 percent from the prior year, while we continued to see pressure in the market on pricing and structure. Credit quality remained strong, reflecting our consistent underwriting discipline as well as the liquidity in the market due to the current business cycle."
 
Wells Fargo Financial
offers consumer installment and home equity lending, automobile financing, consumer and private-label credit cards and commercial services to consumers and businesses throughout the United States and in Canada, Latin America, the Caribbean, Guam and Saipan.
Wells Fargo Financial reported net income of $157 million, compared with $105 million in second quarter 2004. For the first six months of 2005, net income was $184 million, compared with $241 million for the same period a year ago. First quarter 2005 results included $163 million in credit losses to conform Wells Fargo Financials' charge-off timing estimates with FFIEC guidelines. Revenue was $915 million, up 20 percent from $764 million in second quarter 2004, and included a $23 million gain from the sale of loans. Average loans increased 32 percent to $37.3 billion from $28.2 billion a year ago. Noninterest expense increased 10 percent to $425 million from $387 million in second quarter 2004 primarily due to increasing the number of team members by 8 percent.
"Our 20,000 team members achieved double-digit growth in net income and revenue," said Tom Shippee, Wells Fargo Financial president and chief executive officer. "Credit quality remained strong, and loss and delinquency rates were lower than a year ago.
At quarter end, our real estate-secured loan portfolio was $16.7 billion, an increase of 9 percent (unannualized) from March 31, 2005, and up 45 percent from June 30, 2004. This business, which offers primarily debt consolidation products, plus our $11.5 billion in auto receivables, continued to be the primary drivers fueling our loan growth. The success of those businesses and our other units have resulted in receivables at Wells Fargo Financial that totaled $38.8 billion, up 7 percent from the end of first quarter. Real estate-secured lending, auto lending and credit cards are successful businesses in their own right, and also generate significant cross-sell opportunities. During the quarter, we sold our Consumer Auto Receivables portfolio, representing less than 2 percent of our overall auto-lending receivables, which allows us to focus on our core auto-lending business where there is better opportunity to cross-sell our extensive array of financial products and services."
