2005 Highlights:
Fourth Quarter 2005 Highlights:
 
SAN FRANCISCO  Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) reported record diluted earnings per common share of $4.50 for 2005, compared with $4.09 in 2004, up 10 percent. Net income was a record $7.7 billion, up 9 percent from $7.0 billion in 2004. For fourth quarter 2005, net income was $1.9 billion, or $1.14 per share, compared with $1.8 billion, or $1.04 per share, for fourth quarter 2004, an increase in earnings per share of 10 percent.
"Our outstanding team has done it again  another terrific year of exceptional, broad-based performance across our more than 80 businesses," said Chairman and CEO Dick Kovacevich. "The double-digit growth we achieved in revenue and earnings per share is all the more remarkable because  guided by our vision, values and time-tested business model  our team has been producing industry-leading, double-digit annual growth not just for one year, but for the past five, ten, 15 and 20-year periods. Our total shareholder return the past five years was ten times that of the S&P 500, and almost double the S&P 500 for the past ten, 15 and 20 years. These periods included almost every economic cycle and economic condition a financial institution can experience. High and low interest rates. High and low unemployment. Bubbles and recessions. All types of yield curves  steep, flat and inverted. For Wells Fargo to achieve double-digit growth, it doesn't make much difference what the economy is doing because our primary strategy, consistent for 20 years, is to satisfy all our customers' financial needs, help them succeed financially, and through cross-selling, gain market share, wallet share and earn 100 percent of their business. At year-end, our average cross-sell set new records for the company  4.8 products per consumer household and 5.7 products per commercial customer.
"As we have for the past 20 years, we continued to make significant reinvestments in the company to benefit future growth, including opening 92 banking stores, 7 commercial banking offices, 47 mortgage stores and 20 consumer finance stores. During the quarter we agreed to acquire a real estate investment banking firm, Secured Capital Corp., and banks in Colorado and Minnesota. We continue to be #1 in many categories nationally including retail mortgage originations, home equity lending, small business lending, agricultural lending, consumer internet banking, and provider of financial services to middle market companies in the western U.S."
"We achieved record results for 2005, another year of double-digit earnings growth driven, once again, by double-digit revenue growth and single-digit expense growth  positive operating leverage," said Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins. Diluted earnings per share were $1.14, up 10 percent from $1.04 in fourth quarter 2004. As previously disclosed, the incremental personal bankruptcy filings nationwide immediately before the October 17, 2005 change in bankruptcy law, increased fourth quarter charge-offs by $171 million, or $.07 per share. Atkins said this law should be a net positive for Wells Fargo long-term as it will likely reduce the rate of consumer bankruptcy filings. "Despite the $.07 reduction in earnings per share due to incremental consumer bankruptcies, the Company once again achieved double-digit earnings growth, reflecting the strength of our diversified business model," he said. "While mortgage earnings declined from fourth quarter 2004, most of our other businesses achieved double-digit earnings growth, including regional banking, commercial banking, corporate banking, private client services, corporate trust, our home equity and personal credit businesses, asset management, asset-based lending, student lending, commercial real estate and international trade services."
Financial Performance
 
Full year 2005 revenue of $33 billion  a new record  grew 10 percent from 2004 revenue of $30 billion. Revenue of $8.5 billion for fourth quarter 2005 grew $324 million, or 4 percent, from a year ago. Revenue growth was offset by a $77 million decline in equity gains and a $127 million increase in losses on the sale of debt securities from fourth quarter 2004. Home Mortgage revenue declined $178 million from $1.32 billion in fourth quarter 2004 to $1.15 billion in fourth quarter 2005. Combined revenue of businesses other than Home Mortgage grew 7 percent from fourth quarter 2004 to fourth quarter 2005.
Revenue
On a linked-quarter basis, Home Mortgage revenue declined $276 million from $1.43 billion in third quarter 2005 to $1.15 billion in fourth quarter 2005. Combined revenue of businesses other than Home Mortgage grew 15 percent (annualized) from third quarter 2005 to fourth quarter 2005. "This revenue growth was broad based across most of our businesses, which had solid growth in both net interest income and noninterest income," said Atkins.
Average loans of $305.7 billion in fourth quarter 2005 increased 9 percent from $281.2 billion in fourth quarter 2004, and $10.1 billion, or 14 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis. Excluding real estate 1-4 family first mortgage  the loan category impacted by ARM sales throughout the year  total average loans grew by $34.7 billion, or 18 percent, from fourth quarter 2004.
Loans
Average commercial and commercial real estate loans increased $12.4 billion, or 13 percent, from fourth quarter 2004 and increased $2.6 billion, or 10 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis  the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit, linked-quarter growth. Commercial loan growth was broad based across virtually all of our businesses, including small business direct, middle market, commercial real estate, leasing, trade finance and asset-based lending.
Atkins said there was continued strong demand for consumer credit. Average consumer loans increased $10.8 billion, or 6 percent, from fourth quarter 2004 (up 22 percent excluding real estate 1-4 family first mortgages), and $7.2 billion, or 15 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis. First mortgage, home equity, credit card, and other revolving credit and installment loans grew at double-digit rates on a linked-quarter basis (annualized) .
Average core deposits of $253.4 billion for fourth quarter 2005 grew $23.1 billion, or 10 percent, from fourth quarter 2004, and increased $6.2 billion, or 10 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis. Average mortgage escrow deposits were $17.7 billion for fourth quarter 2005, up $3.2 billion from fourth quarter 2004 and down $1.3 billion from third quarter 2005. Excluding mortgage escrow balances, total average core deposits grew 9 percent from fourth quarter 2004 and 13 percent (annualized) from third quarter 2005. Average retail core deposits grew $20.9 billion, or 11 percent, from fourth quarter 2004 and increased $5.7 billion, or 11 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis. Average consumer checking account balances for fourth quarter 2005 grew 11 percent from fourth quarter 2004. "The continued strong growth in checking accounts and core deposits and our gains in market share reflect our exceptional sales and service culture and improving customer retention rates," said Atkins.
Deposits
 
Net interest income for fourth quarter 2005 increased 9 percent from a year ago and 14 percent (annualized) on a linked-quarter basis. "During a year in which the Fed raised rates eight times and the yield curve became non-existent,' our net interest margin remained essentially flat  declining by only 4 basis points  and at 4.84 percent remained the highest margin among large bank holding companies," said Atkins. "In part, our margin performance reflected the benefit of selling $48 billion of the lowest-yielding ARMs on our balance sheet throughout 2005 to further improve our earning asset yield, also the highest among large bank holding companies. During fourth quarter 2005, additional balance sheet repositioning actions included a $124 million loss on the sale of $11 billion of debt securities and $16 million of losses related to the sale of $4.5 billion of ARMs. Net interest margin has also performed better than our peers due to our ability to grow transaction and savings deposits while maintaining our deposit pricing discipline."
Net Interest Income
Noninterest income decreased $59 million from fourth quarter 2004. Atkins said the decrease was due to three factors:
Noninterest Income
, fourth quarter 2005 results included $55 million in mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) valuation allowance release, down from a release of $234 million in fourth quarter 2004. , the losses totaling $124 million in fourth quarter 2005 related to the sale of debt securities for balance sheet repositioning compared with gains of $3 million in fourth quarter 2004. , while equity investment gains remained strong at $93 million, they were down from last year's exceptionally high $170 million.
First
Second
Third
The remaining balance of noninterest income increased 10 percent with fee income growth across our businesses, with particular strength in service charges on deposit accounts, trust, investment and IRA fees, and card fees.
Noninterest expense was down 2 percent, or $88 million, from fourth quarter 2004, which included a $217 million contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation. On a linked-quarter basis noninterest expense was down $6 million, or 1 percent (annualized). Fourth quarter 2005 expenses included $13 million of integration expense. Though overall expenses declined on a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis, the Company continued to invest in future growth. During the quarter, the Company opened 43 new banking stores, renovated 115 banking stores and added 599 new retail bankers. The efficiency ratio improved to 57.5 percent in fourth quarter 2005 from 60.9 percent in fourth quarter 2004.
Noninterest Expense
As required under FAS 123R, the Company began expensing stock options on January 1, 2006. Assuming the Company's February 2006 option grant will vest over a three year period and the valuation and number of options will be the same as the February 2005 grant, the Company expects this expense to reduce 2006 earnings per share by approximately $.06.
"Fourth quarter net credit losses were significantly impacted, as previously disclosed, by the nationwide consumer bankruptcy filing increases in mid-October, immediately prior to legislative changes," said Chief Credit Officer Dave Munio. Fourth quarter net credit losses
Credit Quality
 
were $703 million (.91 percent of average loans outstanding, annualized), which included $171 million (.22 percent) related to incremental bankruptcies above normalized levels, compared with $541 million (.73 percent) during third quarter 2005 and $465 million (.66 percent) one year ago. Without this nationwide increase in personal bankruptcy filings, fourth quarter losses would have been consistent with prior periods, demonstrating continued strong credit performance in the Company's loan portfolios. Although negative for the fourth quarter, the change in law should be a net positive for the Company in the long-term as it will likely reduce the rate of consumer bankruptcy filings. Absent the incremental bankruptcy filings, consumer loan portfolios continued to perform at or near historic low loss levels and the Company's wholesale portfolios were at a virtual zero net loss level for fourth quarter and full year 2005.
Full year 2005 losses were $2.28 billion (.77 percent of average loans outstanding) including the additional fourth quarter bankruptcy credit losses and increased losses, beginning in the first quarter of 2005, for changes in loss recognition rules at Wells Fargo Financial to conform to Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) bank standards for recognizing credit losses, compared with $1.67 billion (.62 percent) in 2004 and $1.72 billion (.81 percent) in 2003. Munio said 2005 net losses were indicative of continued excellent credit performance in the Company's loan portfolios.
"During the fourth quarter, we continued to gather information on customers affected by hurricane Katrina," said Munio. "Virtually all these customers were under payment moratorium programs until year-end 2005, so we do not yet have post-Katrina repayment histories with these customers. Residential real estate payment moratoriums then were extended another 90 days, so additional loss-related information will not be known until at least the end of this period. Based on these facts, we did not take additional Katrina provision in the fourth quarter."
Total nonperforming assets were $1.53 billion (.49 percent of total loans) at December 31, 2005, essentially flat compared with $1.49 billion (.50 percent) at September 30, 2005, and $1.57 billion (.55 percent) at year-end 2004. Wholesale nonperformers continued to decline modestly and were at historically low levels. "As our automobile and residential real estate portfolios season, we expect to see an increase in nonperformers and associated charge-offs," said Munio, "but still at or below our expected losses."
Wells Fargo has three lines of business for management reporting: Community Banking, Wholesale Banking and Wells Fargo Financial. Net income of the three business segments was:
Business Segment Performance
More financial information about the business segments is on pages 27 and 28.
 
Community Banking
offers a complete line of banking and diversified financial products and services for consumers and small businesses including investment, insurance and trust services primarily in 23 midwestern and western states, and mortgage and home equity loans in all 50 states.
Community Banking reported net income of $5.53 billion for 2005, up 13 percent from $4.91 billion for 2004. Total revenue for 2005 increased 9 percent, driven by loan and deposit growth and higher mortgage origination volumes. Noninterest expense for 2005 increased by 8 percent driven by mortgage production, growth in other businesses, and investments in technology, distribution and sales staff. The provision for credit losses for 2005 increased $108 million, or 14 percent, from 2004. Fourth quarter provision for credit losses was $285 million, an increase of $72 million from 2004, reflecting incremental consumer bankruptcy filings before the mid-October legislative reform.
Community Banking reported net income of $1.39 billion in fourth quarter 2005, up 13 percent from $1.23 billion for the same period of 2004. Net interest income increased by $166 million, or 5 percent, compared with fourth quarter 2004, due primarily to growth in earning assets and deposits. Continued balance sheet repositioning offset a decline in net interest margin despite a flat yield curve. Earning assets grew despite sales of low-yielding ARMs. Noninterest income
 
decreased by $116 million, or 4 percent, compared with fourth quarter 2004 due to a lower release of the valuation allowance for mortgage servicing rights, losses on sales of debt securities and lower equity investments gains, partially offset by higher deposit service charges and card fees. Noninterest expense decreased by $224 million, or 6 percent, in fourth quarter 2005 compared with the same period of 2004, due primarily to a $217 million contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation in fourth quarter 2004.
"Once again, our team was able to execute on our cross-sell strategy to achieve annual double-digit increases in significant measurements," said President and COO John Stumpf. "All of this was done while we improved team member engagement and customer retention. Team members are doing a terrific job executing on our vision of helping our customers succeed financially."
Regional Banking Highlights
"Thanks to our talented group of engaged team members, we achieved record annual core sales in 2005, up 15 percent from 2004, selling more than 15.9 million core solutions during the year," said Carrie Tolstedt, group EVP, Regional Banking. "Sales of store-based business solutions increased 26 percent from a year ago. Over 46 percent of new checking account customers have  a checking account and at least three other products. This is up from 37 percent in 2004. As a result of these strong sales, customer cross-sell reached a record high of 4.8 products per consumer (Retail Bank Household). To better serve our customers, we opened 92 banking stores, added 1,691 retail bankers, and increased the number of licensed bankers by 35 percent in 2005. Our team members were even more energized to serve our customers in 2005. Our team member engagement ratio of 5.8 to 1 improved from 4.1 to 1 last year. Household attrition has improved 7 percent over the past two years, attrition of our high value households improved 17 percent over that same period, and overall customer loyalty scores also continue to improve."

Home Mortgage and Home Equity Highlights
"We saw solid growth over 2004 in originations, owned servicing, and the Home Equity portfolio," said Mark Oman, senior EVP, Home and Consumer Finance Group. "We are helping our customers succeed financially by originating nearly $1.1 trillion in home mortgage-related loans over the last three years."
 
The owned servicing portfolio, including commercial mortgages, grew to a record $989 billion at December 31, 2005, up $184 billion, or 23 percent, from December 31, 2004. The carrying value of mortgage servicing rights at year end was $12.5 billion, 1.44 percent of loans serviced for others, compared with $7.9 billion, 1.15 percent, at year-end 2004. The weighted-average note rate of 5.72 percent was 3 basis points lower than at year-end 2004.
Wholesale Banking
serves customers coast to coast, including middle market banking, corporate banking, commercial real estate, treasury management, asset-based lending, insurance brokerage, foreign exchange, trade services, specialized lending, equipment finance, capital markets activities and institutional investments.
Wholesale Banking reported record net income of $1.73 billion in 2005, up 8 percent over 2004, driven largely by a 15 percent increase in earning assets, as well as very low loan losses. Average loans rose 17 percent to $62.2 billion in 2005 from $53.1 billion in 2004 with double-digit increases across all wholesale lending businesses. The provision for credit losses was $1 million in 2005, compared with $62 million a year earlier, with loan charge-offs at very low levels throughout 2005. Noninterest income increased 13 percent to $3.35 billion in 2005, from $2.97 billion in 2004, largely due to the Strong Financial acquisition completed at the end of 2004.
For fourth quarter 2005, Wholesale Banking net income was $439 million, compared with $403 million in fourth quarter 2004, an increase of 9 percent, driven by growth in earning assets. Average loans increased 15 percent to $64.7 billion in fourth quarter 2005 from the prior year.
"We're very pleased with our results for 2005," said Dave Hoyt, senior EVP, Wholesale Banking. "Revenue increased 11 percent for both full year and fourth quarter 2005. Fourth quarter 2005 deposits grew 11 percent from a year ago. Our team generated its ninth consecutive quarter of solid loan growth and a year-over-year increase of 17 percent in a competitive market. We continue to grow because our customers appreciate our relationship banking model and broad product line. Wholesale customers overall have 5.7 products per customer, up from 5.3 products in 2004. In our commercial banking group, our cross-sell is
 
approaching 7 products per customer, with over 20 percent of our offices exceeding our corporate goal of 8 products per customer.
"We're excited to see enthusiastic interest in our industry-leading service, our Check 21 internet solution that enables customers to make deposits from their offices. In October, we agreed to acquire Secured Capital Corp, which with our Eastdil Realty business will continue to deepen our real estate offerings."

Wells Fargo Financial
offers consumer loans primarily through real estate-secured debt consolidation products, automobile financing, consumer and private-label credit cards and commercial services to consumers and businesses throughout the United States and in Canada, Latin America, the Caribbean and the Pacific Rim.
Wells Fargo Financial reported net income of $409 million in 2005, down 34 percent from $617 million in 2004. Net income was reduced by the $163 million charge taken in first quarter 2005 to conform charge-off policies with Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) guidelines, the $100 million provision for credit losses taken in third quarter 2005 for estimated losses from Katrina and the incremental increase in bankruptcies. Total revenue rose 12 percent in 2005, reaching $4.68 billion, compared with $4.19 billion in 2004, on higher net interest income. The provision for credit losses was $1.49 billion in 2005, up from $868 million in 2004. Noninterest expense was $2.56 billion in 2005, up from $2.36 billion in 2004.
For fourth quarter 2005, Wells Fargo Financial's net income was $98 million, compared with $150 million in the same period of 2004, a decrease of 35 percent. Fourth quarter 2005 results reflected an 11 percent increase in revenue, primarily in net interest income due to a 21 percent increase in average loans, offset by a higher level of noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. Provision for credit losses was $411 million, up from $241 million in 2004, partially due to the incremental bankruptcy charge-offs related to the change in bankruptcy law and the effect of the FFIEC loss recognition changes. Average loans were $50.5 billion in fourth quarter 2005 compared with $41.6 billion in fourth quarter 2004.
"Wells Fargo Financial had an excellent year operationally, with receivables growth of 25 percent over year-end 2004," said Tom Shippee, Wells Fargo Financial president and CEO.
 
"Real estate-secured lending and automobile lending were the primary drivers of this growth, and credit quality remained strong, excluding the initial and ongoing impact from the change to conform with the FFIEC charge-off policies, Katrina and bankruptcies."

The following appears in accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:
This news release contains forward-looking statements about the Company, including statements about the expected impact of expensing stock options on our 2006 earnings per share and the expected long-term benefits to the Company from the change in bankruptcy law, and various statements about future credit losses and credit quality. Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements. They give our expectations about the future and are not guarantees. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update them to reflect changes that occur after that date.
There are a number of factors that could cause results to differ significantly from our expectations, including the possibility that the February 2006 option grant may differ from the February 2005 option grant in terms of number of options granted, value of the options granted and/or vesting terms or that the methodology or assumptions we use to calculate the expense relating to our February 2006 option grant may change. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, refer to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, including information incorporated into the Form 10-K from our 2004 Annual Report to Stockholders, filed as Exhibit 13 to the Form 10-K.

Hurricane Katrina has affected the Company's loan portfolios by damaging properties pledged as collateral and by impairing the ability of certain borrowers to repay their loans. The ultimate impact of the hurricane on the Company is difficult to predict and will be affected by a number of factors, including the extent of damage to the collateral, the extent to which damaged collateral is not covered by insurance, the extent to which unemployment and other economic conditions caused by the hurricane adversely affect the ability of borrowers to repay their loans, and the cost to us of collection and foreclosure moratoriums, loan forbearances and other accommodations granted to borrowers and other customers. The impact of the hurricane on the Company may be greater than anticipated.
Any factor described in this news release or in any document referred to in this news release could, by itself or together with one or more other factors, adversely affect the Company's business, earnings and/or financial condition.
