Third Quarter 2006 Highlights
All common share and per share disclosures reflect the two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend distributed August 11, 2006.
 
SAN FRANCISCO  Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) reported record diluted earnings per common share of $0.64 for third quarter 2006, up 10 percent from $0.58 in third quarter 2005. All common share and per share disclosures reflect the two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend distributed August 11, 2006. Net income was a record $2.19 billion, up 11 percent from $1.98 billion in third quarter 2005. For the first nine months of 2006, diluted earnings per share were a record $1.85 and net income was a record $6.30 billion, both up 10 percent from the first nine months of 2005.
"The stagecoach was running on the full horsepower of our diversified business model this quarter as our talented team once again achieved double-digit EPS and net income growth," said Chairman and CEO Dick Kovacevich. "The marketplace continues to recognize the value of our team's ability to satisfy all our customers' financial needs and help them succeed financially. Our stock price reached a record high during the quarter. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2006, our stock's total return was 28 percent, more than double the S&P500's 11 percent. Our market cap at quarter end was $122 billion, up 24 percent from the same time last year. An annual survey in 's ranked us the world's 12 most respected company of any kind, up six places from last year. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. was upgraded by Standard and Poor's to AA+,' their highest rating among all U.S. banks, while maintaining the highest-possible credit rating, Aaa,' from Moody's Investors Service. We also recently became the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the U.S., just part of our commitment to be an outstanding leader in environmental responsibility and stewardship."

th
Diluted earnings per share were $0.64, up 10 percent from $0.58 in third quarter 2005 and up 20 percent (annualized) from $0.61 in second quarter 2006, driven by solid revenue growth and positive operating leverage. Third quarter results included $28 million of stock option expense that was not in past year's results. "The results this quarter once again demonstrated the advantage of our diversified business model," said Senior EVP and Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins. "Despite the uncertain economic and interest rate environment, our diverse group of more than 80 businesses once again produced double-digit earnings growth, led by particular strength in regional banking and wholesale/commercial banking. The Company had continued strong performance on numerous financial measures, including a wider net interest margin, improved operating efficiency and, at 20 percent, the highest return on equity since first quarter 2004."
Financial Performance
Revenue of $8.9 billion grew $431 million, or 5 percent, from a year ago and was up $145 million, or 7 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis. Wells Fargo Home Mortgage (Home Mortgage) revenue declined $502 million to $923 million from $1.4 billion in third quarter 2005, largely due to the $356 million mortgage servicing rights valuation reserve release (income) recorded in third quarter 2005, a quarter in which long-term mortgage interest rates increased 51 basis points. Combined revenue of businesses other than Home Mortgage grew 13 percent from third quarter 2005. Businesses with double-digit, year-over-year revenue growth included business direct, regional banking, merchant card services, credit cards, debit cards, corporate trust, asset-based lending, Eastdil Secured, commercial banking, insurance, international, commercial real estate, specialized financial services and consumer finance.
Revenue
 
Average loans of $304.0 billion increased $8.4 billion, or 3 percent, from third quarter 2005 and increased $3.6 billion, or 5 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis. Excluding real estate 1-4 family first mortgages  the loan category affected by the sale of adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) completed in second quarter 2006  total average loans grew by $30.7 billion, or 14 percent, from third quarter 2005 and 14 percent (annualized) on a linked-quarter basis. Average commercial and commercial real estate loans increased $11.0 billion, or 10 percent, from third quarter 2005 and $2.2 billion, or 8 percent (annualized), from second quarter 2006.
Loans
Average consumer loans decreased $4.2 billion from third quarter 2005 due to the previous sale of ARMs and increased $1.1 billion on a linked-quarter basis. Excluding real estate 1-4 family first mortgages, average consumer loans increased $18.1 billion, or 16 percent, from a year ago and increased $6 billion, or 19 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis. Real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgage, credit card, and other revolving credit and installment loans grew at double-digit rates from third quarter 2005.
Average core deposits of $260.4 billion grew $13.2 billion, or 5 percent, from third quarter 2005, and increased $2.7 billion, or 4 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis. Average mortgage escrow deposits were $19.4 billion, up $367 million from third quarter 2005 and up $1.8 billion on a linked-quarter basis. Excluding mortgage escrow balances, total average core deposits grew 6 percent from third quarter 2005 and 2 percent (annualized) on a linked-quarter basis. Average retail core deposits grew $7.4 billion, or 4 percent, from third quarter 2005 and decreased $1.1 billion on a linked-quarter basis. Average consumer checking account balances grew $4.4 billion, or 5 percent, from third quarter 2005 and declined $660 million, or 3 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis. "However, we continued to achieve strong net growth in consumer checking accounts, up 4.6 percent in third quarter, including 5.4 percent in California," said Atkins.
Deposits
Net interest income increased 8 percent from a year ago and 5 percent (annualized) on a linked-quarter basis. "Despite the flat to inverted yield curve throughout the quarter, our net interest margin increased 3 basis points to 4.79 percent from second quarter 2006, reflecting our ability to grow core deposits, as well as the benefit of balance sheet repositioning completed in the second quarter," said Atkins.
Net Interest Income
Noninterest income increased $60 million, or 2 percent, from third quarter 2005 and 9 percent (annualized) on a linked-quarter basis. Excluding mortgage banking, noninterest income increased 10 percent from third quarter 2005, reflecting strong year-over-year growth in deposit service charges (up 8 percent), trust and investment fees (up 8 percent), debit and credit card fees (up 23 percent) and insurance fees (up 26 percent).
Noninterest Income
Mortgage banking noninterest income declined $259 million from a year ago, largely due to the change in mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) valuation. In third quarter 2005  a quarter in which long-term mortgage interest rates increased 51 basis points  the difference between MSRs impairment reserve release (income) and hedging losses was a net gain of $296 million.
 
In third quarter 2006  a quarter in which mortgage rates declined 48 basis points  the reduction in the value of MSRs net of hedging gains was a net loss of $86 million. Consolidated noninterest income in third quarter 2006 included several items related to the hedging of interest rate and spread changes in the Company's mortgage business:
At September 30, 2006, the unrealized net gains on securities available for sale were $965 million, up from a $49 million net loss at June 30, 2006.
Noninterest expense was up $192 million, or 4 percent, from third quarter 2005 and down $95 million, or 7 percent (annualized), from second quarter 2006, resulting in positive operating leverage on both a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Noninterest expense included $28 million in stock option expense. "We continued to invest in our businesses during the quarter," said Atkins. "In the last 12 months, we've opened 119 new regional banking stores, including 27 stores this quarter. We've grown our sales and service force by adding 5,100 team members (full-time equivalents), including 667 retail bankers in third quarter 2006. As a result of continued positive operating leverage, our efficiency ratio improved to 56.9 percent, the lowest since first quarter 2004."
Noninterest Expense
"Our overall credit quality remained acceptable in third quarter," said Chief Credit Officer Mike Loughlin. "Our wholesale businesses continued to show little or no loss and historically low levels of nonperforming assets. However, as shown in the following table, we saw an increase in loss rates in consumer loans from 0.91 percent (annualized) in third quarter 2005 to 1.17 percent (annualized) in third quarter 2006 due primarily to higher losses in other revolving credit and installment loans. Losses in this category increased $176 million on a linked-quarter basis primarily due to losses in the consumer auto loan portfolio. Third quarter loan losses in other consumer loan categories were comparable to, or better than, loss rates in third quarter 2005, and were well within a range of acceptable expected losses." Third quarter net credit losses were $663 million (0.86 percent of average loans outstanding, annualized) compared with $541 million (0.73 percent) during third quarter 2005 and $432 million (0.58 percent) in second quarter 2006. Year-to-date 2006 net credit losses totaled $1.53 billion (0.67 percent) compared with year-to-date 2005 net losses of $1.58 billion (0.72 percent).
Credit Quality
 
"Consumer auto loan losses increased $150 million from second quarter 2006, accounting for 65 percent of the total increase in consolidated net charge-offs in the quarter of $231 million," said Loughlin. "The increase in consumer auto loan losses in part was due to growth and expected seasoning in the portfolio. In addition, loss rates in this portfolio increased in third quarter in large part due to collection capacity constraints experienced by Wells Fargo Financial and restrictive payment extension practices in the spring of 2006 while Wells Fargo Financial began integrating the prime and non-prime auto loan businesses. During third quarter, Wells Fargo Financial adopted collection practices and standards appropriate for the combined portfolio, began reducing higher risk new auto loans and hired additional collectors and managers, which have now been increased by almost 1,000, or 60 percent, since the beginning of the year. We believe we will see improvement in collections by early 2007, but losses will remain above normal through at least the fourth quarter given the limits to how fast the increased collection capability produces effective results. Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing for other revolving credit and installment consumer loans increased $85 million, or 20 percent, from $431 million in second quarter 2006 to $516 million in third quarter 2006, with about half of the increase due to the auto portfolio."
"In third quarter 2005, we provided $100 million for estimated credit losses related to Hurricane Katrina. Since that time, we have identified and recorded approximately $50 million of Katrina-related losses. Because we do not anticipate any further credit losses attributable to Katrina, we released the remaining $50 million balance in third quarter 2006. We consider the allowance for credit losses of $3.98 billion adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at September 30, 2006," said Loughlin.
Total nonperforming assets were $2.10 billion (0.68 percent of loans) at September 30, 2006, compared with $1.92 billion (0.64 percent) at June 30, 2006, and $1.49 billion (0.50 percent) at September 30, 2005. Foreclosed assets, a component of total nonperforming assets, included an additional $266 million and $238 million at September 30 and June 30, 2006, respectively, for fully insured repurchased Government National Mortgage Association mortgage loans.
 
Wells Fargo has three lines of business for management reporting: Community Banking, Wholesale Banking and Wells Fargo Financial.
Business Segment Performance
"We're very pleased with our performance this quarter, particularly with the continued improvement in the customer experience," said President and Chief Operating Officer John Stumpf. "Our team's relentless focus on satisfying all our customers' financial needs has resulted in improved customer satisfaction and loyalty scores. According to a recent nationally syndicated customer satisfaction study, Wells Fargo was the only mortgage lender to rank in the top five of both sales volume and service satisfaction. Home Mortgage also earned Freddie Mac's prestigious designation as a Tier One Platinum servicer for its outstanding performance in 2005. In Wholesale Banking, according to a leading research firm, Wells Fargo stands apart from the competition with excellent satisfaction scores in the commercial middle market because of our above-average relationship management model."
More financial information about the business segments is on pages 26 and 27.
Community Banking
offers a complete line of diversified financial products and services for consumers and small businesses including investment, insurance and trust services primarily in 23 midwestern and western states, and mortgage and home equity loans in all 50 states.
 
Community Banking reported net income of $1.47 billion, down 1 percent from third quarter 2005. Net interest income increased $83 million, or 3 percent, compared with third quarter 2005, primarily due to growth in earning assets and deposits. Growth in earning assets continued despite the sales of low-yielding ARMs and debt securities. Noninterest income decreased $127 million, or 5 percent, compared with third quarter 2005, predominately due to lower mortgage banking noninterest income, offset by related gains on the sale of debt securities in third quarter 2006. Noninterest expense was $3.39 billion, up $42 million from third quarter 2005, primarily due to an increase in the number of platform bankers.
Regional Banking Highlights
"Our regional banking team continued their strong performance, providing a record 5 million core product solutions (sales) to customers during third quarter, a 17 percent increase over the same period last year," said Carrie Tolstedt, group EVP, Regional Banking. "Day in, day out, our engaged and talented team members work hard to achieve our vision of earning all of our customers' business and helping them succeed financially. Our retail bank household cross-sell continued to rise to a record high of 5.1. Nearly 63 percent of new checking account customers purchased  a checking account and at least three other products. Our focus on the customer experience includes 50,000 store-based customer surveys per month. We began surveying customers following transactions at the teller line in January 2004. Since that time, welcoming and wait time survey scores have improved 36 percent, and customer loyalty scores have improved 23 percent. During this same time frame, retail bank household profitability has improved 23 percent. We began surveying customers following interactions with our platform bankers in July 2005. We've seen a 13 percent improvement in the overall banker customer experience scores during that period. In third quarter 2006, to better serve our customers and meet all their financial needs, we added 667 platform banker FTEs, opened 27 banking stores, and added 82 net new machines."

Home Mortgage and Home Equity Highlights
 
"Our owned real estate servicing portfolio grew to $1.33 trillion, up $215 billion for the quarter," said Mark Oman, senior EVP, Home and Consumer Finance Group. "This growth included $172 billion of servicing acquired during the quarter. Our economies of skill and scale in servicing and our ability to cross sell and retain our servicing customers has made us a leader in a consolidating industry. Our servicing business benefits from a slower housing market as lower prepayments result in a lower rate of MSRs amortization. Reflecting the industry-wide slow down, residential loan originations of $104 billion for the quarter were down $12 billion from the prior quarter."
,
Wholesale Banking
serves customers coast to coast
including middle market banking, corporate banking, commercial real estate, treasury management, asset-based lending, insurance brokerage, foreign exchange, trade services, specialized lending, equipment finance, capital markets activities, and institutional investments.
"We achieved another quarter of strong growth by maintaining our focus on our customers," said Dave Hoyt, senior EVP, Wholesale Banking Group. "Our customer feedback programs, both internal and in partnership with customer research firms, confirm continuing industry leadership in satisfaction with our relationship model.
"We continue to develop our business to meet our customers' financial needs. We expanded on our existing investment banking capabilities by agreeing to acquire Barrington Associates to provide merger and acquisition advisory services for our middle-market and private equity clients. We also expanded our business insurance brokerage company with Acordia Inc.'s acquisition of Bodenhafer Insurance & Investment Group. As we grow, we'll continue to add skilled and experienced team members to help us serve our customers better."
 
Wholesale Banking reported net income of $527 million, up 31 percent from a year ago. Revenue was $1.78 billion, up 20 percent from third quarter 2005, driven by 9 percent earning asset growth coupled with a wider net interest margin and strong insurance, asset management, and capital markets revenue, along with the acquisition of Secured Capital in January 2006 and Reilly Mortgage in July 2006. Noninterest expense was up 12 percent from the prior year, primarily due to higher personnel-related expenses driven by higher staffing levels, along with expenses related to the Secured Capital and Reilly Mortgage acquisitions. Average loans increased 14 percent to $72.3 billion from third quarter 2005, with strength in our real estate and asset-based lending businesses. Core deposits increased 23 percent to $29.1 billion with a significant portion of the growth from new customers.
Wells Fargo Financial
offers consumer loans primarily through real estate-secured debt consolidation products, automobile financing, consumer and private-label credit cards and commercial services to consumers and businesses throughout the United States, Canada, Latin America, the Caribbean and the Pacific Rim.
"Earnings were driven by continued measured growth in receivables and positive operating leverage," said Tom Shippee, Wells Fargo Financial president and CEO. "Excluding the $100 million provision for Hurricane Katrina in third quarter 2005, credit losses increased from a year ago. The majority of the increase related to our auto segment, reflecting some normal seasoning of the portfolio and higher delinquencies as a whole, which the entire auto industry is experiencing. Additionally, the integration of collection platforms and policies for the prime and non-prime auto portfolios contributed to higher losses. In the short term, this integration has impacted delinquency levels, but in the long term we believe it should provide cost savings through more effective and consistent processes."
Wells Fargo Financial reported net income of $194 million, compared with $79 million in third quarter 2005. In third quarter 2006, $50 million of the Katrina-related provision was reversed. Revenue was $1.37 billion, up 15 percent from $1.18 billion in third quarter 2005. Average loans increased 24 percent to $59.2 billion from $47.9 billion a year ago.
