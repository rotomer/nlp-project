Wells Fargo Capital X, a statutory trust created under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Trust"), proposes to sell to the underwriters named in Schedule II hereto (the "Underwriters"), for whom you are acting as Representatives (the "Representatives"), $750,000,000 of its 5.95% Capital Securities, liquidation amount $1,000 per Capital Security (the "Capital Securities"). If the firm or firms listed in Schedule II hereto include only the firm or firms listed in Schedule I hereto, then the terms "Underwriters" and "Representatives", as used herein, shall each be deemed to refer to such firm or firms.
The Capital Securities will be guaranteed (the "Guarantee") by Wells Fargo & Company, a Delaware corporation ("Wells Fargo" or the "Guarantor"), to the extent described in a Guarantee Agreement to be dated as of December 5, 2006 (the "Guarantee Agreement") between the Guarantor and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Guarantee Trustee"). The Trust will use the proceeds from the sale of the Capital Securities and the sale of the Trust Common Securities (as defined below) pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement to be dated as of December 5, 2006 between the Trust and the Guarantor (the "Note Purchase Agreement"), to purchase from the Guarantor $751,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.95% Capital Efficient Notes (the "Notes") to be issued under an Indenture dated as of August 1, 2005 between the Guarantor and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (successor to J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association), as trustee (the "Note Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 5, 2006 between the Guarantor and the Note Trustee (together, the "Indenture"). The Guarantor will also be the holder of one hundred percent of the common securities representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust (the "Trust Common Securities").

Holschuh, as administrative trustees of the Trust and by Wilmington Trust Company, as Delaware trustee (the "Delaware Trustee"), as amended by the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement (the "Trust Agreement") among Wells Fargo, the administrative trustees named therein (the "Administrative Trustees"), the Delaware Trustee and the property trustee named therein (the "Property Trustee") dated as of the date hereof. Under the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Guarantor shall pay, under certain circumstances, certain expenses of the Trust.

(f) Each of the Trust and the Guarantor shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate, signed, with respect to the Trust, by an Administrative Trustee of the Trust and, with respect to the Guarantor, any Senior Vice President or Executive Vice President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Guarantor, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:

6. . If the sale of the Capital Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 5 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Trust and the Guarantor to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Guarantor will reimburse the Underwriters severally upon demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and those described in Section 4(j) hereof) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Capital Securities.

Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Trust and the Guarantor jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement for the registration of the Capital Securities, the Guarantee and the Notes as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party to the extent set forth below, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Trust and the Guarantor will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out
provided
however
 
of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Trust or the Guarantor by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein (it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of such information described as such in the Blood Letter). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Trust or the Guarantor may otherwise have.
(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Trust, the Administrative Trustees, the Guarantor, each of their directors, each of the Guarantor's officers and the Trust's representative who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Trust or the Guarantor within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Trust and the Guarantor to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Trust or the Guarantor by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity (it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of such information described as such in the Blood Letter). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental investigation), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it shall wish, jointly, with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party). In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to obtain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts of interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees
 
and expenses of more than one separate identified firm (in addition to any identified local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives in the case of parties to be indemnified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 7 and by the Guarantor in the case of parties to be indemnified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 7. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its prior written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of the indemnified party.
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 7(a) or 7(b) hereof is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Trust and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and each Underwriter, on the other hand, from the offering of such Capital Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Trust and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and each Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Trust and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and each Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of such Capital Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Capital Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Trust bear to the total discounts and commissions received by each Underwriter in respect thereof. The relative fault of the Trust and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and each Underwriter, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Trust and the Guarantor or by such Underwriter and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. Each Underwriter's obligation to contribute
 
pursuant to this Section 7 shall be several in the proportion that the liquidation amount of Capital Securities the sale of which by such Underwriter gave rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities bears to the aggregate liquidation amount of Capital Securities the sale of which by all Underwriters gave rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, and not joint.
(e) The Trust and the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to Section 7(d) hereof were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d) hereof. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 7(d) hereof shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Capital Securities referred to in Section 7(d) hereof that were offered and sold to the public through such Underwriter exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
pro rata
8. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Capital Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the liquidation amount of Capital Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bear to the aggregate liquidation amount of Capital Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Capital Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate liquidation amount of Capital Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate liquidation amount of Capital Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of such Capital Securities; , that if the remaining Underwriters do not exercise their right to purchase such Capital Securities and arrangements for the purchase of such Capital Securities satisfactory to the Trust and the Guarantor and the Representatives are not made within 36 hours after such default, then this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter, the Trust and the Guarantor. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Trust or the Guarantor and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

Accordingly:
(i) Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be cumulative, and will accumulate whether or not there are funds of the Issuer Trust available for the payment of Distributions. Distributions shall accumulate from December 5, 2006 and, except in the event (and to the extent) that the Depositor exercises its right to defer the payment of interest on the Debentures pursuant to the First Supplemental Indenture, shall be payable semi-annually in arrears on the 15th day of June and December, of each year, commencing on June 15, 2007, through and including December 15, 2036, and monthly in arrears on the 15th day of each month thereafter, commencing on January 15, 2037. In the event that any such date on which a Distribution is payable on or after December 15, 2036 would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day, that date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day unless the postponement would cause that date to fall in the next calendar month, in which case that date will instead be brought forward to the immediately preceding Business Day. If any date prior to December 15, 2036 on which a Distribution is otherwise payable on the Trust Securities is not a Business Day, then the payment of such Distribution shall be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), with the same force and effect as if made on the date on which such payment was originally payable (each date on which distributions are payable in accordance with this Section 4.1(a), a "").

The amount of Distributions payable for any full semi-annual period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The amount of Distributions for any partial semi-annual period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The amount of Distributions for any period commencing on or after December 15, 2036 shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. The amount of Distributions payable for any period shall include the Additional Amounts, if any.
(iii) Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be made by the Property Trustee from the Payment Account and shall be payable on each Distribution Date only to the extent that the Issuer Trust has funds then on hand and available in the Payment Account for the payment of such Distributions.
(b) Distributions on the Trust Securities with respect to a Distribution Date shall be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities at the close of business on the relevant record date for such Distribution Date, which shall be the first day of the month (whether or not a Business Day) in which the relevant Distribution Date occurs; , that
provided, however
 
so long as the Capital Securities are Book-Entry Capital Securities, the record date for such Capital Securities will be one Business Day before the relevant Distribution Date. Distributions payable on any Trust Securities that are not punctually paid on any Distribution Date will cease to be payable to the Person in whose name such Trust Securities are registered on the relevant record date, and such defaulted Distribution will instead be payable to the Person in whose name such Trust Securities are registered on the special record date or other specified date for determining Holders entitled to such defaulted interest established in accordance with the Indenture.
SECTION 4.2. Redemption.
(a) On each Debenture Redemption Date, on each Debenture Repayment Date and on the stated maturity of the Debentures, the Issuer Trust will be required to redeem a Like Amount of Trust Securities at the Redemption Price.
(b) Notice of redemption shall be given by the Property Trustee by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date (or in the case of a Debenture Repayment Date, not less than 10 nor more than 15 Business Days prior to the Redemption Date) to each Holder of Trust Securities to be redeemed, at such Holder's address appearing in the Security Register. All notices of redemption shall state:
(i) the Redemption Date;
(ii) the Redemption Price or if the Redemption Price cannot be calculated prior to the time the notice is required to be sent, the estimate of the Redemption Price together with a statement that it is an estimate and that the actual Redemption Price will be calculated on the third Business Day prior to the Redemption Date (and if an estimate is provided, a further notice shall be sent of the actual Redemption Price on the date that such Redemption Price is calculated);
(iii) the CUSIP number or CUSIP numbers of the Capital Securities affected;
(iv) if less than all the Outstanding Trust Securities are to be redeemed, the identification and the aggregate Liquidation Amount of the particular Trust Securities to be redeemed;
(v) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Trust Security to be redeemed and that Distributions thereon will cease to accumulate on and after said date, except as provided in Section 4.2(d) below; and
(vi) if the Capital Securities are no longer in book-entry-only form, the place or places where the Capital Securities Certificates are to be surrendered for the payment of the Redemption Price.
(c) The Trust Securities redeemed on each Redemption Date shall be redeemed at the Redemption Price with the proceeds from the contemporaneous redemption, repayment or payment at stated maturity of the Debentures. Redemptions of the Trust Securities shall be made and the Redemption Price shall be payable on each Redemption Date only to the extent that the Issuer Trust has funds then on hand and available in the Payment Account for the payment of such Redemption Price.
(d) If the Property Trustee gives a notice of redemption in respect of any Capital Securities, then, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Redemption Date, subject to Section 4.2(c), the Property Trustee will, with respect to Book-Entry Capital Securities, irrevocably deposit with the
 
Clearing Agency for such Book-Entry Capital Securities, to the extent available therefor, funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price and will give such Clearing Agency irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Capital Securities. With respect to Capital Securities that are not Book-Entry Capital Securities, the Property Trustee, subject to Section 4.2(c), will irrevocably deposit with the Paying Agent, to the extent available therefor, funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price and will give the Paying Agent irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Capital Securities upon surrender of their Capital Securities Certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributions payable on or prior to the Redemption Date for any Trust Securities called for redemption shall be payable to the Holders of such Trust Securities as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities on the relevant record dates for the related Distribution Dates. If notice of redemption shall have been given and funds deposited as required, then upon the date of such deposit, all rights of Holders holding Trust Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of such Holders to receive the Redemption Price and any Distribution payable in respect of the Trust Securities on or prior to the Redemption Date, but without interest, and such Trust Securities will cease to be outstanding. In the event that any date on which any Redemption Price is payable is not a Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), with the same force and effect as if made on such date. In the event that payment of the Redemption Price in respect of any Trust Securities called for redemption is improperly withheld or refused and not paid either by the Issuer Trust or by the Depositor pursuant to the Guarantee, Distributions on such Trust Securities will continue to accumulate, as set forth in Section 4.1, from the Redemption Date originally established by the Issuer Trust for such Trust Securities to the date such Redemption Price is actually paid, in which case the actual payment date will be the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the Redemption Price.

Upon the issuance of Definitive Capital Securities Certificates, the Issuer Trustees shall recognize the Holders of the Definitive Capital Securities Certificates as holders of Trust Securities. The Definitive Capital Securities Certificates shall be typewritten, printed, lithographed or engraved or may be produced in any other manner as is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Trustees that meets the requirements of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the Capital Securities are then listed or approved for trading, as evidenced by the execution thereof by the Administrative Trustees or any one of them.
 
SECTION 5.14. Rights of Holders; Waivers of Past Defaults.
(a) The legal title to the Trust Property is vested exclusively in the Property Trustee (in its capacity as such) in accordance with Section 2.9, and the Holders shall not have any right or title therein other than the undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the Issuer Trust conferred by their Trust Securities and they shall have no right to call for any partition or division of property, profits or rights of the Issuer Trust except as described below. The Trust Securities shall be personal property giving only the rights specifically set forth therein and in this Trust Agreement. The Trust Securities shall have no preemptive or similar rights and when issued and delivered to Holders against payment of the purchase price therefor will be fully paid and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, nonassessable by the Issuer Trust. The Holders of the Trust Securities, in their capacities as such, shall be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
(b) For so long as any Capital Securities remain Outstanding, if, upon a Debenture Event of Default with respect to which the Debenture Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Debentures are entitled to declare the principal of all of the Debentures to be immediately due and payable (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include a Debenture Event of Default of the nature set forth in Section 201(k)(2) of the First Supplemental Indenture), the Debenture Trustee fails or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Debentures fail to declare the principal of all of the Debentures to be immediately due and payable, the Property Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities then Outstanding shall have the right to make such declaration by a notice in writing to the Depositor, the Debenture Trustee and the Property Trustee, in the case of notice by the Holders of the Capital Securities, or to the Depositor, the Debenture Trustee and the Holders of the Capital Securities, in the case of notice by the Property Trustee.
At any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Debentures has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Debenture Trustee as in the Indenture provided, the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, by written notice to the Property Trustee, the Depositor and the Debenture Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
(i) the Depositor has paid or deposited with the Debenture Trustee a sum sufficient to pay
(A) all overdue installments of interest on all of the Debentures,
(B) any accrued Additional Interest (as defined in the Indenture) on all of the Debentures,
(C) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Debentures that have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest and Additional Interest (as defined in the Indenture) thereon at the rate borne by the Debentures, and
(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Debenture Trustee under the Indenture and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Debenture Trustee, the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee, their agents and counsel; and
 
(ii) all Events of Default with respect to the Debentures, other than the non-payment of the principal of the Debentures that has become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513 of the Indenture.
The Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Capital Securities, waive any past default under the Indenture, except a default in the payment of principal or interest (unless such default has been cured and a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest and principal due otherwise than by acceleration has been deposited with the Debenture Trustee) or a default in respect of a covenant or provision that under the Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Debenture. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Upon receipt by the Property Trustee of written notice declaring such an acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, by Holders of any part of the Capital Securities a record date shall be established for determining Holders of Outstanding Capital Securities entitled to join in such notice, which record date shall be at the close of business on the day the Property Trustee receives such notice. The Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such notice, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; that, unless such declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall have become effective by virtue of the requisite percentage having joined in such notice prior to the day that is 90 days after such record date, such notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be canceled and of no further effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder, or a proxy of a Holder, from giving, after expiration of such 90-day period, a new written notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, as the case may be, that is identical to a written notice that has been canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in which event a new record date shall be established pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.14(b).
provided
(c) For so long as any Capital Securities remain Outstanding, to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the terms of this Trust Agreement and the Indenture, upon a Debenture Payment Default, any Holder of Capital Securities shall have the right to institute a proceeding directly against the Depositor, pursuant to Section 508 of the Indenture, for enforcement of payment to such Holder of any amounts payable in respect of Debentures having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities of such Holder (a ""). Except as set forth in Section 5.14(b) and this Section 5.14(c), the Holders of Capital Securities shall have no right to exercise directly any right or remedy available to the holders of, or in respect of, the Debentures.
Direct Action
(d) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 5.14, the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Capital Securities, waive any past default or Event of Default and its consequences. Upon such waiver, any such default or Event of Default shall cease to exist, and any default or Event of Default arising there from shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Trust Agreement, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
SECTION 5.15. CUSIP Numbers.
The Administrative Trustees in issuing the Capital Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Property Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the
provided
 
correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Capital Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Capital Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Administrative Trustees will promptly notify the Property Trustee of any change in the CUSIP numbers.
SECTION 6.1. Limitations on Voting Rights.
(a) Except as expressly provided in this Trust Agreement and in the Indenture and as otherwise required by law, no Holder of Capital Securities shall have any right to vote or in any manner otherwise control the administration, operation and management of the Issuer Trust or the obligations of the parties hereto, nor shall anything herein set forth, or contained in the terms of the Trust Securities Certificates, be construed so as to constitute the Holders from time to time as partners or members of an association.
(b) So long as any Debentures are held by the Property Trustee on behalf of the Issuer Trust, the Issuer Trustees shall not (i) direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Debenture Trustee, or execute any trust or power conferred on the Debenture Trustee with respect to the Debentures, (ii) waive any past default that may be waived under Section 513 of the Indenture, (iii) exercise any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Debentures shall be due and payable, or (iv) consent to any amendment, modification or termination of the Indenture or the Debentures, where such consent shall be required, without, in each case, obtaining the prior approval of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, that where a consent under the Indenture would require the consent of each holder of Debentures affected thereby, no such consent shall be given by the Property Trustee without the prior written consent of each Holder of Capital Securities. The Property Trustee shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of the Capital Securities, except by a subsequent vote of the Holders of the Capital Securities. The Property Trustee shall notify all Holders of the Capital Securities of any notice of default received with respect to the Debentures. In addition to obtaining the foregoing approvals of the Holders of the Capital Securities, prior to taking any of the foregoing actions, the Issuer Trustees shall, at the expense of the Depositor, obtain an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that such action shall not cause the Issuer Trust to be taxable as a corporation or classified as other than a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes.
provided, however,
(c) If any proposed amendment to the Trust Agreement provides for, or the Issuer Trustees otherwise propose to effect, (i) any action that would adversely affect in any material respect the powers, preferences or special rights of the Capital Securities, whether by way of amendment to the Trust Agreement or otherwise, or (ii) the dissolution and winding-up of the Issuer Trust, other than pursuant to the terms of this Trust Agreement, then the Holders of Outstanding Capital Securities as a class will be entitled to vote on such amendment or proposal and such amendment or proposal shall not be effective except with the approval of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Trust Agreement, no amendment to this Trust Agreement may be made if, as a result of such amendment, it would cause the Issuer Trust to be taxable as a corporation or classified as other than a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes.
 
SECTION 6.2. Notice of Meetings.
Notice of all meetings of the Holders of the Capital Securities, stating the time, place and purpose of the meeting, shall be given by the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 10.8 to each Holder of Capital Securities, at such Holder's registered address, at least 15 days and not more than 90 days before the meeting. At any such meeting, any business properly before the meeting may be so considered whether or not stated in the notice of the meeting. Any adjourned meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice.
SECTION 6.3. Meetings of Holders of the Capital Securities.
No annual meeting of Holders is required to be held. The Property Trustee, however, shall call a meeting of the Holders of the Capital Securities to vote on any matter upon the written request of the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Outstanding Capital Securities and the Administrative Trustees or the Property Trustee may, at any time in their discretion, call a meeting of the Holders of the Capital Securities to vote on any matters as to which such Holders are entitled to vote.
The Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of the Holders of the Capital Securities.
If a quorum is present at a meeting, an affirmative vote by the Holders present, in person or by proxy, holding Capital Securities representing at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities held by the Holders present, either in person or by proxy, at such meeting shall constitute the action of the Holders of the Capital Securities, unless this Trust Agreement requires a greater number of affirmative votes.
SECTION 6.4. Voting Rights.
Holders shall be entitled to one vote for each $1,000 of Liquidation Amount represented by their Outstanding Trust Securities in respect of any matter as to which such Holders are entitled to vote.
SECTION 6.5. Proxies, etc.
At any meeting of Holders, any Holder entitled to vote thereat may vote by proxy, that no proxy shall be voted at any meeting unless it shall have been placed on file with the Property Trustee, or with such other officer or agent of the Issuer Trust as the Property Trustee may direct, for verification prior to the time at which such vote shall be taken. Pursuant to a resolution of the Property Trustee, proxies may be solicited in the name of the Property Trustee or one or more officers of the Property Trustee. Only Holders of record shall be entitled to vote. When Trust Securities are held jointly by several persons, any one of them may vote at any meeting in person or by proxy in respect of such Trust Securities, but if more than one of them shall be present at such meeting in person or by proxy, and such joint owners or their proxies so present disagree as to any vote to be cast, such vote shall not be received in respect of such Trust Securities. A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a Holder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise, and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger. No proxy shall be valid more than three years after its date of execution.
provided
SECTION 6.6. Holder Action by Written Consent.
Any action that may be taken by Holders at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if Holders holding at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of all Capital Securities entitled to vote in respect of such action (or such larger proportion thereof as shall be required by any other provision of this Trust Agreement) shall consent to the action in writing.
 
SECTION 6.7. Record Date for Voting and Other Purposes.
For the purposes of determining the Holders who are entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting or by written consent, or to participate in any distribution on the Trust Securities in respect of which a record date is not otherwise provided for in this Trust Agreement, or for the purpose of any other action, the Administrative Trustees may from time to time fix a date, not more than 90 days prior to the date of any meeting of Holders or the payment of a Distribution or other action, as the case may be, as a record date for the determination of the identity of the Holders of record for such purposes.
SECTION 6.8. Acts of Holders.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Trust Agreement to be given, made or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Property Trustee. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Trust Agreement and (subject to Section 8.1) conclusive in favor of the Issuer Trustees, if made in the manner provided in this Section.
Act
The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner that any Issuer Trustee receiving the same deems sufficient.
The ownership of Trust Securities shall be proved by the Securities Register.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Trust Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Trust Security and the Holder of every Trust Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Issuer Trustees, or the Issuer Trust in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Trust Security.
Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Trust Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the Liquidation Amount of such Trust Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such Liquidation Amount.
If any dispute shall arise between the Holders and the Issuer Trustees or among the Holders or the Issuer Trustees with respect to the authenticity, validity or binding nature of any request, demand, authorization, direction, consent, waiver or other Act of such Holder or Issuer Trustee under this Article 6, then the determination of such matter by the Property Trustee shall be conclusive with respect to such matter.
 
A Holder may institute a legal proceeding directly against the Depositor under the Guarantee to enforce its rights under the Guarantee without first instituting a legal proceeding against the Guarantee Trustee (as defined in the Guarantee), the Issuer Trust, any Issuer Trustee, or any person or entity.
SECTION 6.9. Inspection of Records.
Upon reasonable notice to the Administrative Trustees and the Property Trustee, the records of the Issuer Trust shall be open to inspection by Holders during normal business hours for any purpose reasonably related to such Holder's interest as a Holder.
SECTION 7.1. Representations and Warranties of the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee.

(f) the execution, delivery and performance of this Trust Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other action on the part of the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee and do not require any approval of stockholders of the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee and such execution, delivery and performance will not (i) violate the charter or by-laws of the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, (ii) violate any provision of, or constitute, with or without notice or lapse of time, a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of, any Lien on any properties included in the Trust Property pursuant to the provisions of, any indenture, mortgage, credit agreement, license or other agreement or instrument to which the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee is a party or by which it is bound, or (iii) violate any law, governmental rule or regulation of the United States or
 
the State of Delaware, as the case may be, governing the banking, trust or general powers of the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee (as appropriate in context) or any order, judgment or decree applicable to the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee;
(g) neither the authorization, execution or delivery by the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee of this Trust Agreement nor the consummation of any of the transactions by the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee (as the case may be) contemplated herein requires the consent or approval of, the giving of notice to, the registration with or the taking of any other action with respect to any governmental authority or agency under any existing law of the United States or the State of Delaware governing the banking, trust or general powers of the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee (as appropriate in context), other than the filing of the Certificate of Trust with the Delaware Secretary of State; and

SECTION 7.2. Representations and Warranties of Depositor.
The Depositor hereby represents and warrants for the benefit of the Holders that:
(a) the Trust Securities Certificates issued at the Time of Delivery on behalf of the Issuer Trust have been duly authorized and will have been duly and validly executed, issued and delivered by the Issuer Trustees pursuant to the terms and provisions of, and in accordance with the requirements of, this Trust Agreement, and the Holders will be, as of such date, entitled to the benefits of this Trust Agreement; and
(b) there are no taxes, fees or other governmental charges payable by the Issuer Trust (or the Issuer Trustees on behalf of the Issuer Trust) under the laws of the State of Delaware or any political subdivision thereof in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by any Issuer Trustee of this Trust Agreement.
SECTION 8.1. Certain Duties and Responsibilities.
(a) The duties and responsibilities of the Issuer Trustees shall be as provided by this Trust Agreement, subject to Section 10.10 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to Section 8.1(c), no provision of this Trust Agreement shall require any of the Issuer Trustees to expend or risk its or their own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its or their duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its or their rights or powers, if it or they shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Trust Agreement relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Issuer Trustees shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 8.1. To the extent that, at law or in equity, an
 
Administrative Trustee has duties and liabilities relating to the Issuer Trust or to the Holders, such Administrative Trustee shall not be liable to the Issuer Trust or to any Holder for such Administrative Trustee's good faith reliance on the provisions of this Trust Agreement. The provisions of this Trust Agreement, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of the Administrative Trustees otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Depositor and the Holders to replace such other duties and liabilities of the Administrative Trustees.
(b) All payments made by the Property Trustee or a Paying Agent in respect of the Trust Securities shall be made only from the revenue and proceeds from the Trust Property and only to the extent that there shall be sufficient revenue or proceeds from the Trust Property to enable the Property Trustee or a Paying Agent to make payments in accordance with the terms hereof. Each Holder, by its acceptance of a Trust Security, agrees that it will look solely to the revenue and proceeds from the Trust Property to the extent legally available for distribution to it as herein provided and that the Issuer Trustees are not personally liable to such Holder for any amount distributable in respect of any Trust Security or for any other liability in respect of any Trust Security. This Section 8.1(b) does not limit the liability of the Issuer Trustees expressly set forth elsewhere in this Trust Agreement or, in the case of the Property Trustee, in the Trust Indenture Act.
(c) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Property Trustee shall enforce this Trust Agreement for the benefit of the Holders.
(d) The Property Trustee, before the occurrence of any Event of Default and after the curing of all Events of Default that may have occurred, shall undertake to perform only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Trust Agreement (including pursuant to Section 10.10), and no implied covenants shall be read into this Trust Agreement against the Property Trustee. If an Event of Default has occurred (that has not been cured or waived pursuant to Section 5.14), the Property Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Trust Agreement, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise thereof, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.
(e) No provision of this Trust Agreement shall be construed to relieve the Property Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
(i) prior to the occurrence of any Event of Default and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default that may have occurred:
(A) the duties and obligations of the Property Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Trust Agreement (including pursuant to Section 10.10), and the Property Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Trust Agreement (including pursuant to Section 10.10); and
(B) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Property Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Trust Agreement; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions that by any provision hereof or of the Trust Indenture Act are specifically required to be furnished to the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Trust Agreement;
 
(ii) the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by an authorized officer of the Property Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Property Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;
(iii) the Property Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Property Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Property Trustee under this Trust Agreement;
(iv) the Property Trustee's sole duty with respect to the custody, safe keeping and physical preservation of the Debentures and the Payment Account shall be to deal with such property in a similar manner as the Property Trustee deals with similar property for its own account, subject to the protections and limitations on liability afforded to the Property Trustee under this Trust Agreement and the Trust Indenture Act;
(v) the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any interest on any money received by it except as it may otherwise agree with the Depositor; and money held by the Property Trustee need not be segregated from other funds held by it except in relation to the Payment Account maintained by the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 3.1 and except to the extent otherwise required by law;
(vi) the Property Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the Administrative Trustees or the Depositor with their respective duties under this Trust Agreement, nor shall the Property Trustee be liable for the default or misconduct of any other Issuer Trustee, the Administrative Trustees or the Depositor; and
(vii) subject to Section 8.1(c), no provision of this Trust Agreement shall require the Property Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if the Property Trustee shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the repayment of such funds or liability is not reasonably assured to it under the terms of this Trust Agreement or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
(f) The Administrative Trustees shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the other Issuer Trustees or the Depositor with their respective duties under this Trust Agreement, nor shall either Administrative Trustee be liable for the default or misconduct of any other Issuer Trustee or the Depositor.
SECTION 8.2. Certain Notices.
Within ninety days after the occurrence of any Event of Default actually known to the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee shall transmit, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 10.8, notice of such Event of Default to the Holders and the Administrative Trustees, unless such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived.
 
Within five Business Days after the receipt of notice of the Depositor's exercise of its right to defer the payment of interest on the Debentures pursuant to the Indenture, the Property Trustee shall transmit, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 10.8, notice of such exercise to the Holders and the Administrative Trustees, unless such exercise shall have been revoked.
The Property Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Event of Default unless the Property Trustee shall have received written notice or a Responsible Officer of the Property Trustee charged with the administration of this Trust Agreement shall have obtained actual knowledge of such Event of Default.
SECTION 8.3. Certain Rights of Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee.
Subject to the provisions of Section 8.1 and Section 2.6:
(a) each of the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting in good faith upon any resolution, Opinion of Counsel, certificate, written representation of a Holder or transferee, certificate of auditors or any other certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, appraisal, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;

provided, however,

action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon and in accordance with such advice; the Property Trustee shall have the right at any time to seek instructions concerning the administration of this Trust Agreement from any court of competent jurisdiction;
(g) neither the Property Trustee nor the Delaware Trustee shall be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Trust Agreement at the request or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Trust Agreement, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities that might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction; that nothing contained in this Section 8.3(g) shall be taken to relieve the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, of its obligation to exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Trust Agreement;
provided
(h) neither the Property Trustee nor the Delaware Trustee shall be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, unless requested in writing to do so by one or more Holders, but each of the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit;
(i) each of the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through its agents or attorneys, that each of the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee shall be responsible for its own negligence or misconduct with respect to selection of any agent or attorney appointed by it hereunder;
provided
(j) whenever in the administration of this Trust Agreement the Property Trustee or, to the extent applicable, the Delaware Trustee shall deem it desirable to receive instructions with respect to enforcing any remedy or right or taking any other action hereunder, the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, (i) may request instructions from the Holders (which instructions may only be given by the Holders of the same proportion in Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities as would be entitled to direct the Property Trustee or, to the extent applicable, the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, under the terms of the Trust Securities in respect of such remedy, right or action), (ii) may refrain from enforcing such remedy or right or taking such other action until such instructions are received, and (iii) shall be protected in acting in accordance with such instructions; and
(k) except as otherwise expressly provided by this Trust Agreement, neither the Property Trustee nor the Delaware Trustee shall be under any obligation to take any action that is discretionary under the provisions of this Trust Agreement.
No provision of this Trust Agreement shall be deemed to impose any duty or obligation on any Issuer Trustee to perform any act or acts or exercise any right, power, duty or obligation conferred or imposed on it, in any jurisdiction in which it shall be illegal, or in which such Person shall be unqualified or incompetent in accordance with applicable law, to perform any such act or acts, or to exercise any such right, power, duty or obligation. No permissive power or authority available to any Issuer Trustee shall be construed to be a duty.
SECTION 8.4. Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities.
The recitals contained herein and in the Trust Securities Certificates shall be taken as the statements of the Issuer Trust and the Depositor, and the Issuer Trustees do not assume any responsibility for their correctness. The Issuer Trustees shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Depositor of the proceeds of the Debentures.
 
SECTION 8.5. May Hold Securities.
Any Issuer Trustee or any other agent of any Issuer Trustee or the Issuer Trust, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Trust Securities and, subject to Sections 8.8 and 8.13, and except as provided in the definition of the term "Outstanding" in Article 1, may otherwise deal with the Issuer Trust with the same rights it would have if it were not Issuer Trustee or such other agent.

Any Issuer Trustee may engage or be interested in any financial or other transaction with the Depositor or any Affiliate of the Depositor, or may act as depository for, trustee or agent for, or act on any committee or body of holders of, securities or other obligations of the Depositor or its Affiliates.

(a) There shall at all times be a Property Trustee hereunder with respect to the Trust Securities. The Property Trustee shall be a Person that is a national or state chartered bank and eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act to act as such and that has a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If any such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of its supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section 8.7 and to the extent permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, the combined capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Property Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.7, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article 8. At the time of appointment, the Property Trustee must have securities rated in one of the three highest rating categories by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.

If the Property Trustee meets such requirements, the Property Trustee may also serve as Delaware Trustee.
SECTION 8.8. Conflicting Interests.
(a) If the Property Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Property Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Trust Agreement.
(b) The Guarantee Agreement and the Indenture shall be deemed to be specifically described in this Trust Agreement for the purposes of clause (i) of the first proviso contained in Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act.
SECTION 8.9. Co-Trustees and Separate Trustee.
Unless and until a Debenture Event of Default or a Debenture Payment Default shall have occurred and be continuing, at any time or times, for the purpose of meeting the legal requirements of the
 
Trust Indenture Act or of any jurisdiction in which any part of the Trust Property may at the time be located, the Holder of Common Securities and the Administrative Trustees shall have the power to appoint one or more Persons either to act as co-trustee, jointly with the Property Trustee, of all or any part of such Trust Property, or to the extent required by law to act as separate trustee of any such property, in either case with such powers as may be provided in the instrument of appointment, and to vest in such Person or Persons in the capacity aforesaid, any property, title, right or power deemed necessary or desirable, subject to the other provisions of this Section. If a Debenture Event of Default or Debenture Payment Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Property Trustee shall have the sole power to so appoint such a co-trustee or separate trustee, and upon the written request of the Property Trustee, the Depositor and the Administrative Trustees shall for such purpose join with the Property Trustee in the execution, delivery, and performance of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to appoint, such co-trustee or separate trustee. Any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed pursuant to this Section shall either be (i) a natural person who is at least 21 years of age and a resident of the United States, or (ii) a legal entity with its principal place of business in the United States that shall act through one or more persons authorized to bind such entity.
Should any written instrument from the Depositor be required by any co-trustee or separate trustee so appointed for more fully confirming to such co-trustee or separate trustee such property, title, right, or power, any and all such instruments shall, on request, be executed, acknowledged and delivered by the Depositor.
Every co-trustee or separate trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, but to such extent only, be appointed subject to the following terms, namely:
(a) The Trust Securities shall be executed by one or more Administrative Trustees, and the Trust Securities shall be delivered by the Property Trustee, and all rights, powers, duties, and obligations hereunder in respect of the custody of securities, cash and other personal property held by, or required to be deposited or pledged with, the Property Trustee specified hereunder shall be exercised solely by the Property Trustee and not by such co-trustee or separate trustee.
(b) The rights, powers, duties, and obligations hereby conferred or imposed upon the Property Trustee in respect of any property covered by such appointment shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed by the Property Trustee or by the Property Trustee and such co-trustee or separate trustee jointly, as shall be provided in the instrument appointing such co-trustee or separate trustee, except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act is to be performed, the Property Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations shall be exercised and performed by such co-trustee or separate trustee.
(c) The Property Trustee at any time, by an instrument in writing executed by it, with the written concurrence of the Depositor, may accept the resignation of or remove any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed under this Section 8.9, and, in case a Debenture Event of Default or Debenture Payment Default has occurred and is continuing, the Property Trustee shall have power to accept the resignation of, or remove, any such co-trustee or separate trustee without the concurrence of the Depositor. Upon the written request of the Property Trustee, the Depositor shall join with the Property Trustee in the execution, delivery and performance of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to effectuate such resignation or removal. A successor to any co-trustee or separate trustee so resigning or removed may be appointed in the manner provided in this Section 8.9.
 
(d) No co-trustee or separate trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of the Property Trustee or any other trustee hereunder.
(e) The Property Trustee shall not be liable by reason of any act of a co-trustee or separate trustee.
(f) Any Act of Holders delivered to the Property Trustee shall be deemed to have been delivered to each such co-trustee and separate trustee.
SECTION 8.10. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.
(a) No resignation or removal of any Issuer Trustee (the "") and no appointment of any successor Issuer Trustee pursuant to this Article 8 shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by such successor Issuer Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11.
Relevant Trustee
Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, the Relevant Trustee may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Holders and by appointing a successor Relevant Trustee. The Relevant Trustee shall appoint a successor by requesting from at least three Persons meeting the eligibility requirements its expenses and charges to serve as the Relevant Trustee on a form provided by the Administrative Trustees, and selecting the Person who agrees to the lowest expenses and charges. If the instrument of acceptance by the successor Issuer Trustee required by Section 8.11 shall not have been delivered to the Relevant Trustee within 60 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the Relevant Trustee may petition, at the expense of the Depositor, in the case of the Property Trustee, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee.
The Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, or both of them, may be removed by Act of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, delivered to the Relevant Trustee (in its individual capacity and, in the case of the Property Trustee, on behalf of the Issuer Trust) (i) for cause (including upon the occurrence of an Event of Default described in subparagraph (d) of the definition thereof with respect to the Relevant Trustee), or (ii) at any time if a Debenture Event of Default or Debenture Payment Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Unless and until a Debenture Event of Default or Debenture Payment Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, or both of them, may be removed at any time by Act of the Holders of the Common Securities.

(a) If an Early Dissolution Event specified in clause (a), (b) or (d) of Section 9.2 occurs or upon the Expiration Date, the Issuer Trust shall be liquidated by the Property Trustee as expeditiously as the Property Trustee determines to be possible by distributing, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Issuer Trust as provided by applicable law including Section 3808(e) of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, to each Holder a Like Amount of Debentures, subject to Section 9.4(d). Notice of liquidation shall be given by the Property Trustee by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Liquidation Date to each Holder of Trust Securities at such Holder's address appearing in the Securities Register. All such notices of liquidation shall:
(i) state the CUSIP Number of the Trust Securities;
(ii) state the Liquidation Date;
(iii) state that from and after the Liquidation Date, the Trust Securities will no longer be deemed to be Outstanding and any Trust Securities Certificates not surrendered for exchange will be deemed to represent a Like Amount of Debentures, or if Section 9.4(d) applies, a right to receive a Liquidation Distribution; and
(iv) provide such information with respect to the mechanics by which Holders may exchange Trust Securities Certificates for Debentures, or if Section 9.4(d) applies, receive a Liquidation Distribution, as the Property Trustee (after consultation with the Administrative Trustees) shall deem appropriate.
(b) Except where Section 9.2(c) or 9.4(d) applies, in order to effect the liquidation of the Issuer Trust and distribution of the Debentures to Holders, the Property Trustee, either itself acting as exchange agent or through the appointment of a separate exchange agent, shall establish a record date for such distribution (which shall be not more than 30 days prior to the Liquidation Date) and, establish such procedures as it shall deem appropriate to effect the distribution of Debentures in exchange for the Outstanding Trust Securities Certificates.
(c) Except where Section 9.2(c) or 9.4(d) applies, after the Liquidation Date, (i) the Trust Securities will no longer be deemed to be Outstanding, (ii) certificates representing a Like Amount of Debentures will be issued to Holders of Trust Securities Certificates, upon surrender of such Certificates to the exchange agent for exchange, (iii) any Trust Securities Certificates not so surrendered for exchange will be deemed to represent a Like Amount of Debentures bearing accrued and unpaid interest in an
 
amount equal to the accumulated and unpaid Distributions on such Trust Securities Certificates until such certificates are so surrendered (and until such certificates are so surrendered, no payments of interest or principal will be made to Holders of Trust Securities Certificates with respect to such Debentures) and (iv) all rights of Holders holding Trust Securities will cease, except the right of such Holders to receive Debentures upon surrender of Trust Securities Certificates.
(d) If, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 9.4, whether because of an order for dissolution entered by a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, distribution of the Debentures in the manner provided herein is determined by the Property Trustee not to be practical, or if an Early Dissolution Event specified in clause (c) of Section 9.2 occurs, the Trust Property shall be liquidated, and the Issuer Trust shall be dissolved and its affairs wound-up, by the Property Trustee in such manner as the Property Trustee determines, subject to applicable law. In such event, on the date of the dissolution, winding-up or other termination of the Issuer Trust, Holders will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Issuer Trust available for distribution to Holders, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Issuer Trust as provided by applicable law, including Section 3808(e) of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, an amount equal to the Liquidation Amount per Trust Security plus accumulated and unpaid Distributions thereon to the date of payment (such amount being the ""). If, upon any such dissolution, winding up or termination, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Issuer Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then, subject to the next succeeding sentence, the amounts payable by the Issuer Trust on the Trust Securities shall be paid on a basis (based upon Liquidation Amounts). The Holders of the Common Securities will be entitled to receive Liquidation Distributions upon any such dissolution, winding-up or termination (determined as aforesaid) with Holders of Capital Securities, except that the Capital Securities shall have a priority over the Common Securities under the circumstances provided in Section 4.3.

Exhibit 5.1
Wells Fargo & Company
420 Montgomery Street
San Francisco, California 94163
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Senior Counsel of Wells Fargo & Company (the "Company") and, as such, I, together with other attorneys in the Wells Fargo Law Department, have acted as counsel for the Company in connection with the preparation of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement") of the Company and Wells Fargo Capital X, Wells Fargo Capital XI, Wells Fargo Capital XII and Wells Fargo Capital XIII filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to the proposed offer and sale from time to time of the securities referred to therein, and a Prospectus Supplement dated November 27, 2006 to the Prospectus dated June 19, 2006 (together, the "Prospectus") relating to the offer and sale by the Company under the Registration Statement of $751,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Capital Efficient Notes (the "CENts"). The CENts are to be issued under the Indenture dated as of August 1, 2005, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 5, 2006 (the "Indenture") entered into by the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (successor in interest to J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association), as trustee, and sold pursuant to the CENts Purchase Agreement dated December 5, 2006, (the "CENts Purchase Agreement") between the Company and Wells Fargo Capital X (the "Trust").
I, or attorneys in the Wells Fargo Law Department under my direction, have examined such documents, records, and instruments as I have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
Based on the foregoing, I am of the opinion that the CENts have been duly authorized and, when duly executed by the Company, authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, and delivered to and paid for by the Trust pursuant to the CENts Purchase Agreement, the CENts will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms subject, as to their legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and subject to general equity principles (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and except further as enforcement thereof may be
Wells Fargo & Company

limited by any governmental authority that limits, delays or prohibits the making of payments outside the United States.
I have relied as to certain relevant facts upon certificates of, and/or information provided by officers and employees of the Company as to the accuracy of such factual matters without independent verification thereof or other investigation. I have also relied, without investigation, upon the following assumptions: (i) natural persons acting on behalf of the Company have sufficient legal capacity to enter into and perform, on behalf of the Company, the transaction in question; (ii) each party to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreements or instruments enforceable against it; (iii) each party to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company has complied with all legal requirements pertaining to its status as such status relates to its rights to enforce such agreements or instruments against the Company; (iv) each document submitted to me for review is accurate and complete, each such document that is an original is authentic, each such document that is a copy conforms to an authentic original, and all signatures on each such document are genuine; (v) there has not been any mutual mistake of fact or misunderstanding, fraud, duress or undue influence; and (vi) all statutes, judicial and administrative decisions, and rules and regulations of governmental agencies, constituting the law of the opining jurisdictions, are publicly available to lawyers practicing in Minnesota.
Without limiting any other qualifications set forth herein, the opinions expressed herein regarding the enforceability of the CENts are subject to the effect of generally applicable laws that (i) provide for the enforcement of oral waivers or modifications where a material change of position in reliance thereon has occurred or provide that a course of performance may operate as a waiver, (ii) limit the availability of a remedy under certain circumstances where another remedy has been elected, (iii) may, where less than all of a contract may be unenforceable, limit the enforceability of the balance of the contract to circumstances in which the unenforceable portion is not an essential part of the agreed exchange, (iv) govern and afford judicial discretion regarding the determination of damages and entitlement to attorneys' fees and other costs, (v) may permit a party who has materially failed to render or offer performance required by a contract to cure that failure unless either permitting a cure would unreasonably hinder the aggrieved party from making substitute arrangements for performance or it is important under the circumstances to the aggrieved party that performance occur by the date stated in the contract, (vi) may require mitigation of damages, and (vii) may limit the enforceability of provisions imposing increased interest rates or late payment charges upon delinquency in payment or default or providing for liquidated damages or for premiums upon acceleration.
I express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of Minnesota, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and the federal laws of the United States of America. I express no opinion as to whether, or the extent to which, the laws of any particular jurisdiction apply to the subject matter hereof, including, without limitation, the enforceability of the governing law provision contained in the CENts. Because the governing law provision of the CENts relates to the law of a jurisdiction as to which I express no opinion,
Wells Fargo & Company
December 5, 2006
Page 3
the opinion regarding enforceability of the CENts set forth herein is given as if the law of the State of Minnesota governs the CENts.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the opinions expressed do not address the need for future authorization by the Company of the issuance of securities in connection with various covenants contained in the Indenture and the CENts.
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company filed with the Commission and thereby incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement. In giving such consent, I do not thereby admit that I am in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special Delaware counsel for Wells Fargo & Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company") and Wells Fargo Capital X, a Delaware statutory trust (the "Trust"), in connection with the matters set forth herein. At your request, this opinion is being furnished to you.
For purposes of giving the opinions hereinafter set forth, our examination of documents has been limited to the examination of originals or copies of the following:

Initially capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined are used as defined in the Trust Agreement, except that reference herein to any document shall mean such document as in effect on the date hereof.
For purposes of this opinion, we have not reviewed any documents other than the documents listed in paragraphs (a) through (e) above. In particular, we have not reviewed any document (other than the documents listed in paragraphs (a) through (e) above) that is referred to in or incorporated by reference into the documents reviewed by us. We have assumed that there exists no provision in any document that we have not reviewed that is inconsistent with the opinions stated herein. We have conducted no independent factual investigation of our own but rather have relied solely upon the foregoing documents, the statements and information set forth therein and the additional matters recited or assumed herein, all of which we have assumed to be true, complete and accurate in all material respects.
With respect to all documents examined by us, we have assumed (i) the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as authentic originals, (ii) the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies or forms, and (iii) the genuineness of all signatures.
For purposes of this opinion, we have assumed (i) that the Trust Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties thereto with respect to the subject matter thereof, including with respect to the creation, operation and termination of the Trust, that the Certificate of Trust is in full force and effect and has not been amended, (ii) except to the extent provided in paragraph 1 below, the due creation or due organization or due formation, as the case may be, and valid existence in good standing of each party to the documents examined by us under the laws of the jurisdiction governing its creation, organization or formation, (iii) the legal capacity of natural persons who are parties to the documents examined by us, (iv) that each of the parties to the documents examined by us has the power and authority to execute and deliver, and to

perform its obligations under, such documents, (v) the due authorization, execution and delivery by all parties thereto of all documents examined by us, (vi) the receipt by each Person to whom a Capital Security is to be issued by the Trust (collectively, the "Capital Security Holders") of a Capital Securities Certificate for such Capital Security and the payment for the Capital Security acquired by it, in accordance with the Trust Agreement and the Underwriting Agreement, and (vii) that the Capital Securities are issued and sold to the Capital Security Holders in accordance with the Trust Agreement and the Underwriting Agreement, and as described in the Prospectus. We have not participated in the preparation of the Registration Statement or Prospectus and assume no responsibility for their contents.
This opinion is limited to the laws of the State of Delaware (excluding the securities laws of the State of Delaware), and we have not considered and express no opinion on the laws of any other jurisdiction, including federal laws and rules and regulations relating thereto. Our opinions are rendered only with respect to Delaware laws and rules, regulations and orders thereunder which are currently in effect.
Based upon the foregoing, and upon our examination of such questions of law and statutes of the State of Delaware as we have considered necessary or appropriate, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and exceptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
1. The Trust has been duly created and is validly existing in good standing as a statutory trust under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, 12 Del. C.  3801, et seq.
2. The Capital Securities of the Trust have been duly authorized by the Trust Agreement and, when executed and delivered in accordance with the Trust Agreement and the Underwriting Agreement, will be duly and validly issued and, subject to the qualifications set forth in paragraph 3 below, fully paid and non-assessable undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust.
3. The Capital Security Holders, as beneficial owners of the Trust, will be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. We note that the Capital Security Holders may be obligated to make certain payments under the Trust Agreement.
We consent to the filing of this opinion with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K and its incorporation by reference into the Registration Statement. In giving the foregoing consent, we do not thereby admit that we come within the category of Persons whose consent is required
