Fourth Quarter 2006 Highlights:
 
SAN FRANCISCO  Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) reported record diluted earnings per common share of $2.49 for 2006, up 11 percent from $2.25 in 2005. Net income was a record $8.48 billion, up 11 percent from $7.67 billion in 2005. For fourth quarter 2006, net income was $2.18 billion, or $0.64 per share, compared with $1.93 billion, or $0.57 per share, for fourth quarter 2005, an increase in earnings per share of 12 percent.
"Our outstanding team has done it again  another terrific year of exceptional, broad-based performance across our more than 80 businesses with double-digit growth for the quarter in both revenue and earnings per share," said Chairman and CEO Dick Kovacevich. "But that's nothing new. Over the past twenty years, our annual compound growth rate in earnings per share was 14 percent and our annual compound rate in revenue was 12 percent. Our total annual compound stockholder return of 14 percent the past five years was more than double the S&P 500  and at 15 percent almost double for the past ten years. We far out-paced the S&P 500 the past 15 and 20 years with total annual compound shareholder returns of 18 percent and 21 percent, respectively  periods with almost every economic cycle and economic condition a financial institution can experience. Our cross-sell set records for the eighth consecutive year  5.2 products per Community Banking household, almost one in five have more than eight, six for Wholesale Banking customers, and our average middle-market commercial banking customer has more than seven products. We became the first major U.S. bank to enable customers to wire money account-to-account to China and Vietnam. We continue to be #1 in many categories of financial services nationally, including retail mortgage originations, home equity lending, small business lending, agricultural lending, internet banking, and provider of financial services to middle-market companies in the western U.S."
"Fourth quarter earnings per share growth of 12 percent capped another year of double-digit earnings growth, driven by strong revenue growth, wider operating margins and continued strengthening of our balance sheet," said Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins. "The breadth and depth of our business model, once again in the fourth quarter, resulted in very strong and balanced growth across market segments (community banking earnings up 9 percent; wholesale banking earnings up 14 percent; Wells Fargo Financial earnings up 64 percent), across product sources (net interest income up 4 percent, noninterest income up 19 percent) and across businesses (double-digit revenue and/or profit growth in regional banking, business direct, private client services, credit and debit card, corporate trust, commercial banking, asset-based lending, asset management, Eastdil Realty, insurance, international, commercial real estate, and specialized financial services)."
Financial Performance
Revenue for the year was a record $35.7 billion, up 8 percent from $32.9 billion in 2005. Revenue growth accelerated to 11 percent in the fourth quarter, up $921 million from a year ago to $9.4 billion in fourth quarter 2006. On a linked-quarter basis, revenue increased $479 million, or 21 percent (annualized). Full-year Home Mortgage revenue declined $704 million to $4.2 billion in 2006 from $4.9 billion in 2005 and declined $116 million to $1.0 billion in fourth quarter 2006 from $1.1 billion in fourth quarter 2005. On a linked-quarter basis, Home Mortgage revenue increased $110 million. Combined revenue in businesses other than Home Mortgage grew 12 percent on a full-year basis from 2005 to 2006, increased 14 percent from fourth quarter 2005 to fourth quarter 2006 and increased 18 percent (annualized) on a linked-quarter basis. Virtually every major business line other than Home Mortgage generated double-digit revenue growth.
Revenue
 
Average loans of $312.2 billion in fourth quarter 2006 grew $8.2 billion, or 11 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis and growth was not affected by any adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) sales. Year-over-year, average loans increased $6.5 billion, or 2 percent. Excluding real estate 1-4 family first mortgage  the loan category affected by the sale of ARMs during the year  total average loans grew by $31.9 billion, or 14 percent, from fourth quarter 2005.
Loans
Average commercial and commercial real estate loans increased $11.5 billion, or 11 percent, from fourth quarter 2005 and increased $3.0 billion, or 10 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis. Year-over-year, there has been double-digit growth for nine consecutive quarters.
Average consumer loans increased $5.1 billion, or 11 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis and decreased $6.3 billion from fourth quarter 2005 due to the previous sales of ARMs. Excluding real estate 1-4 family first mortgages, average consumer loans increased $19.1 billion, or 16 percent, from a year ago. Average real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgage, credit card, and other revolving credit and installment loans grew at double-digit rates from a year ago.
Average core deposits of $267.8 billion for fourth quarter 2006 increased $7.4 billion, or 11 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis and grew $14.4 billion, or 6 percent, from fourth quarter 2005. Average mortgage escrow deposits were $20.2 billion for fourth quarter 2006, up $2.5 billion from fourth quarter 2005 and up $846 million on a linked-quarter basis. Excluding mortgage escrow balances, total average core deposits grew 5 percent from fourth quarter 2005 and 11 percent (annualized) on a linked-quarter basis. Average retail core deposits grew $5.3 billion, or 3 percent, from fourth quarter 2005 and increased $3.6 billion, or 7 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis. Average net new consumer checking accounts grew 4.7 percent from fourth quarter 2005. "We continued to experience good growth in core deposits and in net new checking accounts," said Atkins.
Deposits
Net interest income for fourth quarter 2006 increased 4 percent from a year ago and was relatively flat from third quarter 2006. For the fourth quarter, the net interest margin increased 14 basis points to 4.93 percent on a linked-quarter basis, increased 9 basis points from a year ago and increased 10 basis points from mid-2004 when the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates. "The increase in the margin was driven by several factors," said Atkins. "First, we sold our lowest-yielding long-term securities in the third quarter, in part related to our use of securities to hedge a portion of our mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). Second, high-quality, higher-yielding commercial and consumer loans grew solidly in the fourth quarter relative to lower-yielding securities and mortgages held for sale. Third, we continued to experience good deposit growth while maintaining our deposit pricing discipline."
Net Interest Income
Noninterest income increased $710 million, or 19 percent, from fourth quarter 2005 and 49 percent (annualized) on a linked-quarter basis. Noninterest income increased across the Company's businesses with strong double-digit increases from fourth quarter 2005 in trust and investment fees (up 18 percent); debit and credit card fees (up 22 percent); other fees, primarily commercial real estate brokerage (up 15 percent); and insurance fees (up 10 percent).

Noninterest Income
 
markets and equity investment results also were strong during the quarter. At December 31, 2006, the unrealized net gains on securities available for sale were $926 million.
Mortgage banking noninterest income increased $49 million from fourth quarter 2005, and $193 million from third quarter 2006, primarily due to higher servicing fees as the total servicing portfolio continued to grow, and improved margins on sales of loans. In fourth quarter 2006, market-related valuation changes to MSRs, net of hedge results, were largely offset by other related valuation and interest rate driven charges to mortgage banking noninterest income.
Noninterest expense was up $528 million, or 11 percent, from fourth quarter 2005 and up $330 million from third quarter 2006. Noninterest expense for fourth quarter 2006 included $26 million in stock option expense and a $31 million expense paid in the quarter to call approximately $800 million of trust preferred securities. Because the Company was able to refinance this debt at a rate approximately 200 basis points lower, its net interest expense will be reduced by approximately $320 million over the next twenty years. Fourth quarter expenses also included approximately $84 million of expenses ($22 million of which was integration-related) from companies or businesses acquired during 2006, including Secured Capital Corp. and the operating platform of the servicing portfolio acquired from Washington Mutual. "We continued to invest in our people and our businesses," said Atkins. "In 2006, we opened 109 regional banking stores, including 33 stores this quarter. We grew our sales and service force by adding 4,497 team members (full-time equivalents) in 2006, including 1,914 retail platform bankers. Despite these added expenses, our efficiency ratio was 57.5 percent in fourth quarter 2006, flat from a year ago and up slightly from 56.9 percent in third quarter 2006. All of the slight increase in the efficiency ratio from third quarter 2006 was essentially due to the $31 million call premium expense and the $22 million of integration expense."
Noninterest Expense
"Fourth quarter 2006 credit results were in line with our expectations," said Chief Credit Officer Mike Loughlin. Fourth quarter net credit losses were $726 million (0.92 percent of average loans, annualized) compared with $663 million (0.86 percent) in third quarter 2006 and $703 million (0.91 percent) in fourth quarter 2005. Fourth quarter 2005 net losses included $171 million (0.22 percent) of incremental one-time losses attributed to bankruptcy legislation enacted during that quarter.
Credit Quality
"All loan portfolios, excluding auto, continued to perform at or better than expectations," said Loughlin. "We saw a modest increase in residential real estate losses from very low run rates. We continued to be satisfied with the performance of our residential first and second mortgage portfolios. In the wholesale loan portfolios, loss rates continued to be low, but we expect them to modestly increase during 2007.
"As expected, during the fourth quarter, the auto loan portfolio continued to post losses at elevated levels, although compared with the third quarter, losses in that category were essentially flat. During the fourth quarter, we continued to hire and train new collectors and contracted with external collections vendors to increase capacity. We also adjusted account acquisition strategies to reduce new loan volumes, particularly in higher-risk tiers. We anticipate these actions will stabilize losses in early 2007 and lead to improved loss rates. We monitor vintage credit performance to identify potential adverse credit or economic trends. We saw higher delinquency and losses in recent auto vintages, consistent with industry-wide experience.
 
We did not see any material deterioration of any vintages, including the most recent vintages, in other consumer portfolios, such as credit cards or home equity."
Total nonperforming assets were $2.42 billion (0.76 percent of loans) at December 31, 2006, compared with $2.10 billion (0.68 percent) at September 30, 2006. Fully insured GNMA mortgages in foreclosure of $322 million and $266 million were included in the fourth and third quarter balances, respectively. At year-end 2005, nonperforming assets were $1.53 billion (0.49 percent). "Residential real estate loans and repossessed autos comprised about 70 percent of total nonperforming assets and had relatively low loss content," said Loughlin. "Commercial and commercial real estate nonperforming assets, at $543 million, remained at historically low levels and had minimal land, real estate construction or condo conversion exposure."
Wells Fargo has three lines of business for management reporting: Community Banking, Wholesale Banking and Wells Fargo Financial. Net income of the three business segments was:
Business Segment Performance
"The value of our diversified business model and the efforts of our outstanding team members have once again led to strong financial performance and an improved customer experience," said President and Chief Operating Officer John Stumpf. "We've said that an engaged team creates loyal customers and, in 2006, we continued to set new records in team member engagement and customer cross-sell. Our customers continued to benefit from the investments we've made in our broad distribution network of stores, phone bank, ATMs and wellsfargo.com. Placer Sierra Bancshares, which we recently agreed to acquire, pending necessary approvals, will help increase Wells Fargo's presence in California and provide more service points for our customers. Our team remains focused on satisfying all of the financial needs of our customers and helping them succeed financially."
More financial information about the business segments is on pages 26 and 27.
Community Banking
offers a complete line of diversified financial products and services for consumers and small businesses including investment, insurance and trust services primarily in 23 midwestern and western states, and mortgage and home equity loans in all 50 states.

Community Banking reported net income of $5.53 billion for 2006, up from $5.47 billion for 2005. Total revenue for 2006 increased 4 percent, driven by loan and deposit growth offsetting $704 million lower revenue from the mortgage company. Noninterest expense for 2006 increased 7 percent driven by investments in technology, distribution and sales staff. The provision for credit losses for 2006 decreased $8 million from 2005. Fourth quarter provision for credit losses was $275 million, a decrease of $10 million from 2005, reflecting incremental consumer bankruptcy filings before the mid-October 2005 legislative reform.
Regional Banking highlights
"Our great team  focused on our vision of earning all of our customers' business and helping them succeed financially  achieved outstanding results in 2006 with a record 18.7 million core product solutions (sales) to customers, up 17 percent over 2005," said Carrie Tolstedt, group EVP, Regional Banking. "Our retail bank household cross-sell continued to rise to a record high of 5.2. In 2006, 62 percent of new checking account customers purchased These results would not be possible without the dedication of our talented team members. In 2006, our team member engagement ratio rose to 7.1 to 1, up from 5.8 to 1 in 2005. Additionally, we continue to see positive trends in our customer experience levels. We conduct 50,000 store-based customer surveys per month. For customers transacting at the teller line, welcoming and wait time survey scores were up 44 percent and customer loyalty scores improved 32 percent, since we began surveying in January 2004. In 2006, we added

1,914 platform banker FTEs, opened 109 banking stores, and added 246 net new machines to better serve our customers and meet all their financial needs."

"The past year has been a very challenging year for the mortgage industry with the flat to inverted yield curve and a slowdown in the housing sector," said Mark Oman, senior EVP, Home and Consumer Finance Group. "Despite this environment, we continued our long track record of growing our mortgage servicing businesses at double-digit rates, which provides opportunities to cross-sell and retain these customers. We remain very disciplined in residential real estate lending by ensuring that our product offering is appropriate for both our customers and the investors in our securities. We have not offered some of the higher-risk products, such as the payment option ARM."

Wholesale Banking
serves customers coast to coast
including middle market banking, corporate banking, commercial real estate, treasury management, asset-based lending, insurance brokerage, foreign exchange, trade services, specialized lending, equipment finance, capital markets activities, and institutional investments.
"Wholesale Banking, for the eighth consecutive year, achieved record net income with strong double-digit growth in revenue and loans across the businesses," said Dave Hoyt, senior EVP, Wholesale Banking Group. "We continue to focus on satisfying all of our customers' financial needs, increasing to 6 products per wholesale banking customer. Two-thirds of our commercial banking customers are active users of our industry-leading online business portal. We processed more than $90 billion of checks through our internet-based industry-leading service.

"To continue providing outstanding service and advice to our customers, we acquired this year commercial real estate investment advisor Secured Capital Corp., investment banker Barrington Associates, multifamily real estate finance firm Reilly Mortgage, accounts receivable purchasers Commerce Funding and Evergreen Funding, and three commercial insurance agencies. We opened six commercial banking offices, nine commercial real estate offices nationwide and a foreign exchange office in Atlanta. With 14 offices, we have one of the largest foreign exchange sales teams in North America."
Wholesale Banking reported record net income of $2.1 billion in 2006, up 17 percent over 2005, driven largely by an 11 percent increase in earning assets and an expanding net interest margin, as well as continuing low loan losses. Average loans rose 15 percent to $71.4 billion in 2006 from $62.2 billion in 2005, with double-digit increases across the majority of the wholesale lending businesses. Average deposits grew 45 percent entirely due to increases in interest-bearing deposits, driven by a mix of organic customer growth, conversions of customer sweep accounts from off-balance sheet money market funds into Wells Fargo deposits, and continued growth in foreign central bank deposits. The provision for credit losses was $16 million in 2006, compared with $1 million a year earlier. Noninterest income increased 15 percent to $4.31 billion in 2006 from $3.76 billion in 2005, due to acquisitions, along with stronger asset management, capital markets, insurance and foreign exchange revenue. Noninterest expense increased 18 percent to $4.11 billion in 2006 from $3.49 billion in 2005, driven by higher personnel-related expenses including staff additions, merit increases, higher incentive payments, and stock option expense along with higher expenses from our acquisitions, expenses related to higher sales volumes, and investments in new offices, businesses and systems.
Wells Fargo Financial
offers consumer loans primarily through real estate-secured debt consolidation products, automobile financing, consumer and private-label credit cards and commercial services to consumers and businesses throughout the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and the Pacific Rim.
"Wells Fargo Financial completed another strong year, with record net earnings to go along with continued refinement of our business model," said Tom Shippee, Wells Fargo Financial president and CEO. "We successfully completed a number of strategic initiatives that make us better positioned to serve the financial needs of our customers. For example, in the past year we combined our auto lending and consumer lending stores in the U.S. into a single-store network,
 
and we integrated all of Wells Fargo's indirect auto lending operations in the U.S. and Canada into one full-spectrum automobile lending business.
"During the fourth quarter, we continued to focus on reducing losses and delinquencies in our auto lending business by improving processes and staffing levels in collections. As a result, our auto growth slowed as expected in the fourth quarter. Auto loans grew less than 2 percent from the end of the third quarter. Our real estate-secured lending portfolio continued to grow, although at a slower pace than in previous quarters, which was consistent with industry trends."
Wells Fargo Financial reported net income of $865 million in 2006, up from $409 million in 2005. Net income for 2005 included incremental losses due to the change in the bankruptcy law, a first quarter 2005 $163 million charge (pre tax) to conform Wells Fargo Financial's charge off practices with Federal Financial Institution Examination Council guidelines, and $100 million (pre tax) for estimated losses from Hurricane Katrina. Net income for 2006 included a $50 million (pre tax) release of provision for credit losses reversing the remaining portion of the provision for Hurricane Katrina. Revenue rose 16 percent in 2006 to $5.43 billion, compared with $4.68 billion in 2005. The provision for credit losses was $1.30 billion in 2006, down from $1.49 billion in 2005. Noninterest expense was $2.81 billion in 2006, up from $2.56 billion in 2005.
