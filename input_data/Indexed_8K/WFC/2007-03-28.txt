TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION
This is one of the Securities of the
series designated therein referred to
in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
General
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture dated as of July 21, 1999, as amended or supplemented from time to time (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Citibank, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series of the Securities designated as Medium-Term Notes, Series G, of the Company, which series is limited to an aggregate principal amount of $25,000,000,000 or the equivalent thereof in one or more foreign or composite currencies minus the aggregate principal amount of the Company's Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series H which may be issued from time to time. The Securities of this series may mature at different times, bear interest, if any, at different rates, be redeemable at different times or not at all, be repayable at the option of the Holder at different times or not at all, be issued at an original issue discount and be denominated in different currencies.
The Securities are issuable only in registered form without coupons and will be either (a) book-entry securities represented by one or more Global Securities recorded in the book-entry system maintained by the Depositary or (b) certificated securities issued to and registered in the names of, the beneficial owners or their nominees.
Interest Rate Reset
The interest rate in effect from the Original Issue Date to the Initial Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof shall be the Initial Interest Rate specified on the face hereof. Commencing with the Initial Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof following the Original Issue Date specified on the face hereof, the interest rate on this Security will be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually as specified on the face hereof under "Interest Reset Period". Each such adjusted rate shall be applicable from and including the Interest Reset Date to which it relates to but not including the next succeeding Interest Reset Date or until Maturity, as the case may be. On each Interest Reset Date, the rate of interest on this Security shall be the rate determined with respect to the Interest Determination Date next preceding such Interest Reset Date in accordance with the provisions of the applicable heading below and adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified on the face hereof, and/or by the multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof.
If any Interest Reset Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the following Business Day, except that if the Base Rate specified above is LIBOR or EURIBOR and if such following Business Day is in the next calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
The amount of interest to be paid on this Security for each Interest Period will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of this Security by an accrued interest factor. The "accrued interest factor" will be computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day in the Interest Period. The "interest factor" for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to that day:
 
 
 
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, all percentages resulting from any calculation referred to herein shall be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with .000005% rounded up to .00001% and all U.S. dollar amounts used in or resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest cent, with one-half cent rounded upward. If the Japanese Yen is the Index Currency, all Japanese Yen amounts used in or resulting from these calculations will be rounded downward to the next lower Japanese Yen amount. All amounts denominated in any other currency used in or resulting from these calculations will be rounded to the nearest two decimal places in that currency, with .005 round up to.01.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate per annum hereon shall not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, specified on the face hereof. The Calculation Agent shall calculate the interest rate hereon in accordance with the foregoing on or before each Calculation Date.
The interest rate on this Security shall in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law, as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.
At the request of the Holder hereof, the Calculation Agent shall provide to the Holder hereof the interest rate hereon then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate that will become effective on the next Interest Reset Date with respect to this Security. The Calculation Agent's determination of any interest rate shall be final and binding in the absence of manifest error.

General
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture dated as of July 21, 1999, as amended or supplemented from time to time (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Citibank, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series of the Securities designated as Medium-Term Notes, Series G, of the Company, which series is limited to an aggregate principal amount of $25,000,000,000 or the equivalent thereof in one or more foreign or composite currencies minus the aggregate principal amount of the Company's Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series H which may be issued from time to time. The Securities of this series may mature at different times, bear interest, if any, at different rates, be redeemable at different times or not at all, be repayable at the option of the Holder at different times or not at all, be issued at an original issue discount and be denominated in different currencies.
The Securities are issuable only in registered form without coupons and will be either (a) book-entry securities represented by one or more Global Securities recorded in the book-entry system maintained by the Depositary or (b) certificated securities issued to and registered in the names of, the beneficial owners or their nominees.
Interest Rate Reset
The interest rate in effect from the Interest Accrual Date to the Initial Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof shall be the Initial Interest Rate specified on the face hereof. Commencing with the Initial Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof following the Interest Accrual Date specified on the face hereof, the interest rate on this Security will be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually as specified on the face hereof under "Interest Reset Period". Each such adjusted rate shall be applicable from and including the Interest Reset Date to which it relates to but not including the next succeeding Interest Reset Date or until Maturity, as the case may be. On each Interest Reset Date, the rate of interest on this Security shall be the rate determined with respect to the Interest Determination Date next preceding such Interest Reset Date in accordance with the provisions of the applicable heading below and adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified on the face hereof, and/or by the multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof.
If any Interest Reset Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the following Business Day, except that if the Base Rate specified above is LIBOR or EURIBOR and if such following Business Day is in the next calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
The amount of interest to be paid on this Security for each Interest Period will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of this Security by an accrued interest factor. The "accrued interest factor" will be computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day in the Interest Period. The "interest factor" for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to that day:

If the Japanese Yen is the Index Currency, all Japanese Yen amounts used in or resulting from these calculations will be rounded downward to the next lower Japanese Yen amount. All amounts denominated in any other currency used in or resulting from these calculations will be rounded to the nearest two decimal places in that currency, with .005 round up to.01.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate per annum hereon shall not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, specified on the face hereof. The Calculation Agent shall calculate the interest rate hereon in accordance with the foregoing on or before each Calculation Date.
The interest rate on this Security shall in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law, as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.
At the request of the Holder hereof, the Calculation Agent shall provide to the Holder hereof the interest rate hereon then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate that will become effective on the next Interest Reset Date with respect to this Security. The Calculation Agent's determination of any interest rate shall be final and binding in the absence of manifest error.

Exhibit 5.1
Wells Fargo & Company
420 Montgomery Street
San Francisco, California 94163
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Senior Counsel of Wells Fargo & Company (the "Company") and, as such, I, together with other attorneys in the Wells Fargo Law Department, have acted as counsel for the Company in connection with the preparation of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement") of the Company and Wells Fargo Capital X, Wells Fargo Capital XI, Wells Fargo Capital XII and Wells Fargo Capital XIII filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to the proposed offer and sale from time to time of the securities referred to therein, and a Pricing Supplement dated March 21, 2007 to the Prospectus Supplement dated January 25, 2007 to the Prospectus dated June 19, 2006 (together, the "Prospectus") relating to the offer and sale by the Company under the Registration Statement of $3,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Medium-Term Notes, Series G, Senior Extendible Floating Rate Notes (the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued under the Indenture dated as of July 21, 1999 (the "Indenture") entered into by the Company and Citibank, N.A., as trustee, and sold pursuant to the Terms Agreement dated March 21, 2007 between the Company and the Agents named therein (the "Terms Agreement").
I, or attorneys in the Wells Fargo Law Department under my direction, have examined such documents, records, and instruments as I have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
Based on the foregoing, I am of the opinion that the Notes have been duly authorized and, when duly executed by the Company, authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, and delivered to and paid for by the Agents pursuant to the Terms Agreement, the Notes will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms subject, as to their legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and subject to general equity principles (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and except further as enforcement thereof may be limited by any governmental authority that limits, delays or prohibits the making of payments outside the United States.

I have relied as to certain relevant facts upon certificates of, and/or information provided by officers and employees of the Company as to the accuracy of such factual matters without independent verification thereof or other investigation. I have also relied, without investigation, upon the following assumptions: (i) natural persons acting on behalf of the Company have sufficient legal capacity to enter into and perform, on behalf of the Company, the transaction in question; (ii) each party to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreements or instruments enforceable against it; (iii) each party to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company has complied with all legal requirements pertaining to its status as such status relates to its rights to enforce such agreements or instruments against the Company; (iv) each document submitted to me for review is accurate and complete, each such document that is an original is authentic, each such document that is a copy conforms to an authentic original, and all signatures on each such document are genuine; (v) there has not been any mutual mistake of fact or misunderstanding, fraud, duress or undue influence; and (vi) all statutes, judicial and administrative decisions, and rules and regulations of governmental agencies, constituting the law of the opining jurisdictions, are publicly available to lawyers practicing in Minnesota.
Without limiting any other qualifications set forth herein, the opinions expressed herein regarding the enforceability of the Notes are subject to the effect of generally applicable laws that (i) provide for the enforcement of oral waivers or modifications where a material change of position in reliance thereon has occurred or provide that a course of performance may operate as a waiver, (ii) limit the availability of a remedy under certain circumstances where another remedy has been elected, (iii) may, where less than all of a contract may be unenforceable, limit the enforceability of the balance of the contract to circumstances in which the unenforceable portion is not an essential part of the agreed exchange, (iv) govern and afford judicial discretion regarding the determination of damages and entitlement to attorneys' fees and other costs, (v) may permit a party who has materially failed to render or offer performance required by a contract to cure that failure unless either permitting a cure would unreasonably hinder the aggrieved party from making substitute arrangements for performance or it is important under the circumstances to the aggrieved party that performance occur by the date stated in the contract, (vi) may require mitigation of damages, and (vii) may limit the enforceability of provisions imposing increased interest rates or late payment charges upon delinquency in payment or default or providing for liquidated damages or for premiums upon acceleration.
I express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of Minnesota, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and the federal laws of the United States of America. I express no opinion as to whether, or the extent to which, the laws of any particular jurisdiction apply to the subject matter hereof, including, without limitation, the enforceability of the governing law provision contained in the Notes. Because the governing law provision of the Notes relates to the law of a jurisdiction as to which I express no opinion, the opinion regarding enforceability of the Notes set forth herein is given as if the law of the State of Minnesota governs the Notes.
