On June 19, 2007, Wells Fargo & Company issued $2,200,000,000 Medium-Term Notes, Series G, Fixed Rate-Floating Rate Notes (the "Notes"). The purpose of this Current Report is to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission the form of Note and the opinion of Mary E. Schaffner, Esq. regarding the Notes.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, on June 19, 2007.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 4.1
 
 
Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation ("DTC"), to the Issuer or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.
 
WELLS FARGO & COMPANY, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (hereinafter called the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of ($) on the Stated Maturity Date shown above and to pay interest, if any, on the principal amount hereof, from June 19, 2007 to, but excluding, June 19, 2008 at the rate per annum of 5.506% on June 19, 2008 (the "Fixed Rate Interest Payment Date"), and from June 19, 2008 to, but excluding, the date of Maturity on the Interest Payment Dates specified above, commencing with September 19, 2008, and at Maturity, at the Base Rate plus the Spread specified above, as determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with the provisions on the reverse hereof under the heading "Determination of LIBOR." The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Interest payable upon Maturity will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. The Regular Record Date for an Interest Payment Date shall be the fifteenth calendar day, whether or not a Business Day, prior to such Interest Payment Date.
                                                 
            
Except as provided in the next succeeding sentence, if an Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, other than an Interest Payment Date that is also the date of Maturity, such Interest Payment Date will be postponed to the following day that is a Business Day, except that, if such following Business Day is in the next calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding day that is a Business Day. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Fixed Rate Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, interest on this Security shall be payable on the next day that is a Business Day, with the same force and effect as if made on such Fixed Rate Interest Payment Date, and without any interest or other payment with respect to the delay. If the date of Maturity would fall on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal and any premium and interest shall be made on the next Business Day, with the same force and effect as if made on the due date, and no additional interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such date of Maturity. For purposes of this Security, "Business Day" means a day other than a Saturday or Sunday that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law or regulation to close in New York, New York or Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Interest payments on this Security shall be the amount of interest accrued from and including the Original Issue Date specified above or from and including the last date to which interest has been paid, or provided for, as the case may be, to but excluding, the following Interest Payment Date or the date of Maturity. This period is referred to as an "Interest Period." If this Security has been issued upon transfer of, in exchange for, or in replacement of, a Predecessor Security, interest on this Security shall accrue from the last Interest Payment Date to which interest was paid on such Predecessor Security or, if no interest was paid on such Predecessor Security, from the Original Issue Date specified above. The first payment of interest on a Security originally issued and dated between a Regular Record Date specified above and an Interest Payment Date will be due and payable on the Interest Payment Date following the next succeeding Regular Record Date to the registered owner on such next succeeding Regular Record Date.
 
The principal (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security is payable by the Company in the Specified Currency specified above.
Any interest not punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.
Payment of interest on this Security other than payments of interest at Maturity will be paid by check mailed to the Person entitled thereto at such Person's last address as it appears in the Security Register or by wire transfer to such account as may have been designated by such Person. Payment of principal of and interest on this Security at Maturity will be made against presentation of this Security at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the City of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for so long as this Security is a Global Security registered in the name of the Depositary, payments of principal and interest on this Security will be made to the Depositary by wire transfer of immediately available funds.
The Company will pay any administrative costs imposed by banks on payors in making payments on this Security in immediately available funds and the Holder of this Security shall pay any administrative costs imposed by banks on payees in connection with such payments. Any tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed upon payments on this Security will be borne by the Holder of this Security.
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature or its duly authorized agent under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.
 
 
General
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture dated as of July 21, 1999, as amended or supplemented from time to time (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Citibank, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series of the Securities designated as Medium-Term Notes, Series G, of the Company, which series is limited to an aggregate principal amount of $25,000,000,000 or the equivalent thereof in one or more foreign or composite currencies minus the aggregate principal amount of the Company's Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series H which may be issued from time to time. The Securities of this series may mature at different times, bear interest, if any, at different rates, be redeemable at different times or not at all, be repayable at the option of the Holder at different times or not at all, be issued at an original issue discount and be denominated in different currencies.
The Securities are issuable only in registered form without coupons and will be either (a) book-entry securities represented by one or more Global Securities recorded in the book-entry system maintained by the Depositary or (b) certificated securities issued to and registered in the names of, the beneficial owners or their nominees.
Interest Rate Reset
The interest rate in effect from the Original Issue Date to, but excluding, June 19, 2008 shall be 5.506% per annum and the interest rate in effect on and after June 19, 2008 shall be the Base Rate plus the Spread specified above. Commencing with the Initial Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof, the interest rate on this Security will be reset quarterly as specified on the face hereof under "Interest Reset Period." Each such adjusted rate shall be applicable from and including the Interest Reset Date to which it relates to but not including the next succeeding Interest Reset Date or until Maturity, as the case may be. On each Interest Reset Date, the rate of interest on this Security shall be the rate determined with respect to the Interest Determination Date next preceding such Interest Reset Date in accordance with the provisions of the applicable heading below and adjusted by the addition of the Spread specified on the face hereof.
If any Interest Reset Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the following Business Day, except that if such following Business Day is in the next calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
 
The amount of interest to be paid on this Security for each Interest Period will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of this Security by an accrued interest factor. The "accrued interest factor" will be computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day in the Interest Period. The "interest factor" for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to that day:
 
 
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, all percentages resulting from any calculation referred to herein shall be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with .000005% rounded up to .00001% and all U.S. dollar amounts used in or resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest cent, with one-half cent rounded upward. All U.S. dollar amounts used in or resulting from these calculations will be rounded to the nearest two decimal places in that currency, with .005 round up to .01.
The interest rate on this Security shall in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law, as the same may be modified by United States law of general application. The Calculation Agent shall calculate the interest rate hereon in accordance with the foregoing on or before each Calculation Date.
At the request of the Holder hereof, the Calculation Agent shall provide to the Holder hereof the interest rate hereon then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate that will become effective on the next Interest Reset Date with respect to this Security. The Calculation Agent's determination of any interest rate shall be final and binding in the absence of manifest error. The Calculation Agent shall notify the Paying Agent of each determination of the interest applicable to this Security promptly after the determination is made.
A "Calculation Date", where applicable, for any Interest Determination Date will be the earlier of:
 
 
Determination of LIBOR
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof is LIBOR, the interest rate per annum shall be determined by the Calculation Agent for each Interest Determination Date specified on the face hereof as follows:
 
As of the Interest Determination Date, LIBOR will be either LIBOR Reuters or LIBOR Telerate:
 
 
 
 
 
The "Index Currency" means the currency specified on the face hereof as the currency for which LIBOR will be calculated or, if the euro is substituted for that currency, the Index Currency will be the euro. If no currency is specified on the face hereof, the Index Currency will be U.S. dollars.
"Designated LIBOR Page" means either (i) if "LIBOR Reuters" is designated on the face hereof, the display on the Reuters Money 3000 Service for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for the applicable Index Currency or its designated successor, or (ii) if "LIBOR Telerate" is designated on the face hereof, the display on Moneyline Telerate, or any successor service, on the page specified on the face hereof, or any other page as may replace that page on that service, for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for the applicable Index Currency.
"Euro LIBOR Securities" means LIBOR debt securities for which the Index Currency is euros.
"London Banking Day" means any day on which dealings in deposits in the Index Currency specified above are transacted in the London interbank market.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding affected by certain provisions of the Indenture, acting together as a class, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with those provisions of the Indenture. Certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences may be waived under the Indenture by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

Exhibit 5.1
Wells Fargo & Company
420 Montgomery Street
San Francisco, California 94163
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Senior Counsel of Wells Fargo & Company (the "Company") and, as such, I, together with other attorneys in the Wells Fargo Law Department, have acted as counsel for the Company in connection with the preparation of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement") of the Company and Wells Fargo Capital X, Wells Fargo Capital XI, Wells Fargo Capital XII and Wells Fargo Capital XIII filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to the proposed offer and sale from time to time of the securities referred to therein, a Pricing Supplement dated June 12, 2007 (the "First Pricing Supplement") and a Pricing Supplement dated June 13, 2007 (the "Second Pricing Supplement," and together with the First Pricing Supplement, the "Pricing Supplements") to the Prospectus Supplement dated January 25, 2007 to the Prospectus dated June 19, 2006 (together, the "Prospectus") relating to the offer and sale by the Company under the Registration Statement of $2,200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Medium-Term Notes, Series G, Fixed Rate-Floating Rate Notes (the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued under the Indenture dated as of July 21, 1999 (the "Indenture") entered into by the Company and Citibank, N.A., as trustee, and sold pursuant to the Terms Agreement dated June 12, 2007 between the Company and the Agent named therein (the "First Terms Agreement") and the Terms Agreement dated June 13, 2007 between the Company and the Agent named therein (the "Second Terms Agreement," and together with the First Terms Agreement, the "Terms Agreements").
I, or attorneys in the Wells Fargo Law Department under my direction, have examined such documents, records, and instruments as I have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
Based on the foregoing, I am of the opinion that the Notes have been duly authorized and, when duly executed by the Company, authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, and delivered to and paid for by the Agent pursuant to the Terms Agreements, the Notes will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms subject, as to their legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and

subject to general equity principles (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and except further as enforcement thereof may be limited by any governmental authority that limits, delays or prohibits the making of payments outside the United States.
I have relied as to certain relevant facts upon certificates of, and/or information provided by officers and employees of the Company as to the accuracy of such factual matters without independent verification thereof or other investigation. I have also relied, without investigation, upon the following assumptions: (i) natural persons acting on behalf of the Company have sufficient legal capacity to enter into and perform, on behalf of the Company, the transaction in question; (ii) each party to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreements or instruments enforceable against it; (iii) each party to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company has complied with all legal requirements pertaining to its status as such status relates to its rights to enforce such agreements or instruments against the Company; (iv) each document submitted to me for review is accurate and complete, each such document that is an original is authentic, each such document that is a copy conforms to an authentic original, and all signatures on each such document are genuine; (v) there has not been any mutual mistake of fact or misunderstanding, fraud, duress or undue influence; and (vi) all statutes, judicial and administrative decisions, and rules and regulations of governmental agencies, constituting the law of the opining jurisdictions, are publicly available to lawyers practicing in Minnesota.
Without limiting any other qualifications set forth herein, the opinions expressed herein regarding the enforceability of the Notes are subject to the effect of generally applicable laws that (i) provide for the enforcement of oral waivers or modifications where a material change of position in reliance thereon has occurred or provide that a course of performance may operate as a waiver, (ii) limit the availability of a remedy under certain circumstances where another remedy has been elected, (iii) may, where less than all of a contract may be unenforceable, limit the enforceability of the balance of the contract to circumstances in which the unenforceable portion is not an essential part of the agreed exchange, (iv) govern and afford judicial discretion regarding the determination of damages and entitlement to attorneys' fees and other costs, (v) may permit a party who has materially failed to render or offer performance required by a contract to cure that failure unless either permitting a cure would unreasonably hinder the aggrieved party from making substitute arrangements for performance or it is important under the circumstances to the aggrieved party that performance occur by the date stated in the contract, (vi) may require mitigation of damages, and (vii) may limit the enforceability of provisions imposing increased interest rates or late payment charges upon delinquency in payment or default or providing for liquidated damages or for premiums upon acceleration.
I express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of Minnesota, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and the federal laws of the United States of America. I express no opinion as to whether, or the extent to which, the laws of any particular jurisdiction apply to the subject matter hereof, including, without limitation, the enforceability of the governing law provision contained in the Notes. Because the governing law

provision of the Notes relates to the law of a jurisdiction as to which I express no opinion, the opinion regarding enforceability of the Notes set forth herein is given as if the law of the State of Minnesota governs the Notes.
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company filed with the Commission and thereby incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement. In giving such consent, I do not thereby admit that I am in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act.
