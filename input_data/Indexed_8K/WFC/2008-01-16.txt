Full Year 2007:
Fourth Quarter 2007:
 
SAN FRANCISCO  Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) reported diluted earnings per common share of $2.38 for 2007 compared with $2.47 in 2006. Net income was $8.06 billion compared with $8.42 billion in 2006. Full year results included the impact of the previously announced $1.4 billion (pre tax) credit reserve build ($0.27 per share) and $203 million Visa litigation expense ($0.04 per share) for 2007 and $95 million ($0.02 per share) of Visa litigation expense for 2006. Net income was $1.36 billion, or $0.41 per share, for fourth quarter 2007 compared with $2.18 billion, or $0.64 per share, for fourth quarter 2006. Fourth quarter results included the impact of the $1.4 billion (pre tax) credit reserve build ($0.27 per share).
"Despite the industry headwinds and challenging economic environment, our outstanding team members produced record revenue for both the fourth quarter and full year," said President and CEO John Stumpf. "We expect the environment to remain challenging in 2008, particularly in the consumer sector, but we're as committed as ever to satisfying all our customers' financial needs and believe we have the right strategy and team in place to do just that. Our talented team did exceptionally well in fundamental areas such as account, revenue and deposit growth and we expanded distribution and cross-sell to both consumer and commercial customers. Our diversified business model, financial strength and rigorous execution have enabled us to manage through challenging times better than most and 2007 proved that. It was also a productive year for acquisitions, including our acquisitions of Placer Sierra Bancorp and Greater Bay Bancorp. We also recently agreed to acquire the banking operations of United Bancorporation of Wyoming, which will make us the largest bank in our nation's ninth fastest-growing state. This is not the first economic downturn our industry has seen and it won't be the last. That's why we've built our model and our team to meet customer needs as a priority through all economic conditions  a commitment every bit as strong today as it's been over our 156-year history."
"Despite the challenging environment in 2007, Wells Fargo had a strong year and strong fourth quarter," said Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins. "We believe we will be among the few large banks in the U.S. that achieved both double-digit top line revenue growth as well as positive operating leverage (revenue growth of 10.4 percent exceeding expense growth of 9.5 percent). Our pre-tax pre-provision profit (revenue less noninterest expense) rose to an annual record of $16.6 billion, up 12 percent from the prior year, and, on a strong fourth quarter, to a quarterly record of $4.3 billion, up 8 percent year-over-year, and 12 percent (annualized) on a linked-quarter basis. The strength of these business results reflected record sales and double-digit growth in loans, deposits and fee income for the full year," said Atkins.
Financial Performance
"While we were not immune to the unexpectedly sharp and rapid downturn in housing, and our earnings were reduced in the fourth quarter by the $1.4 billion credit reserve build, primarily for home equity losses, we largely avoided the problems and costly asset write-downs many large financial institutions incurred. We maintained one of the highest return on equity ratios among large bank holding companies, at 17.1 percent, as well as one of the strongest capital positions in the industry for 2007. With our strong capital position, the challenges facing the industry and the significant upward re-pricing of asset spreads, we are finding significantly more opportunities now for acquisitions, portfolio purchases, and attractive loan and asset purchases than we have seen in the past five years."
 
Revenue for the year was a record $39.4 billion, up 10 percent from $35.7 billion in 2006. Revenue increased 8 percent in the fourth quarter to $10.2 billion, another record, up $792 million from a year ago. On a linked-quarter basis, revenue growth accelerated to 14 percent (annualized), up $352 million. "Our strong revenue growth was driven by solid, across the board volume growth in loans, deposits and fee-based products," said Atkins. "Many of our businesses continued to post double-digit, year-over-year revenue growth, including business direct, wealth management, credit and debit card, global remittance services, personal credit management, home mortgage, asset-based lending, asset management, specialized financial services and international."
Revenue
Average loans of $374.4 billion in fourth quarter 2007 grew $62.2 billion, or 20 percent, from fourth quarter 2006. On a linked-quarter basis, average loans increased $23.7 billion, or 27 percent (annualized). Average commercial and commercial real estate loans increased $28.4 billion, or 24 percent, from fourth quarter 2006 and increased $12.6 billion, or 37 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis. This was the 13 consecutive quarter of double-digit, year-over-year growth in average commercial and commercial real estate loans.
Loans
th
Average consumer loans increased $32.8 billion, or 18 percent, from a year ago and increased $10.9 billion, or 21 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis. Average real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgage and credit card loans grew at double-digit rates from a year ago. The acquisition of Greater Bay Bancorp added $5.1 billion of average total loans in the fourth quarter, including $4.7 billion of commercial loans and $400 million of consumer loans.
Average core deposits of $314.8 billion for fourth quarter 2007 increased $31.0 billion, or 11 percent, from fourth quarter 2006. On a linked-quarter basis, average core deposits grew $8.7 billion, or 11 percent (annualized). Average mortgage escrow deposits were $19.8 billion for fourth quarter 2007, down $392 million from fourth quarter 2006 and down $2.6 billion on a linked-quarter basis. Excluding mortgage escrow balances, total average core deposits grew 12 percent from fourth quarter 2006 and 16 percent (annualized) on a linked-quarter basis. Average retail core deposits grew $14.2 billion, or 6 percent, from fourth quarter 2006 and increased $5.6 billion, or 10 percent (annualized), on a linked-quarter basis. Average net new consumer checking accounts grew 4.7 percent from fourth quarter 2006, including 5.7 percent net new consumer account growth in California. The acquisition of Greater Bay Bancorp added $3.6 billion of average deposits in the fourth quarter, $3.4 billion of which were retail core deposits.
Deposits
Net interest income increased $438 million, or 9 percent, from a year ago and increased $208 million, or 16 percent (annualized), from third quarter 2007 due to solid earning asset growth (up 16 percent year-over-year and up 10 percent (annualized) on a linked-quarter basis) combined with a 7 basis point expansion in the net interest margin to 4.62 percent on a linked-quarter basis. "The Company continued to have one of the highest net interest margins among large U.S. bank holding companies," said Atkins. Net interest income was reduced by approximately $22 million in the quarter due to the impact of temporarily elevated short-term London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR).
Net Interest Income
 
Noninterest income increased $354 million, or 8 percent, from fourth quarter 2006 and increased 12 percent (annualized) on a linked-quarter basis. Noninterest income increased across the Company's businesses from fourth quarter 2006, with double-digit increases in debit and credit card fees (up 22 percent), deposit service charges (up 13 percent) and insurance fees (up 24 percent), along with a solid increase in trust and investment fees (up 9 percent). Capital markets and equity investment results also were strong during the quarter. Mortgage banking noninterest income increased $154 million, or 23 percent, from fourth quarter 2006, because net servicing fee income growth exceeded the impact of a 20 percent decline in home mortgage originations.
Noninterest Income
The 12 percent annualized growth in noninterest income on a linked-quarter basis reflected, in part, strong double-digit annualized growth in trust and investment fees, card fees and insurance income. During the quarter, mortgage banking noninterest income was impacted by changes in interest rates, widening credit spreads and other housing/credit market conditions, including:
Unrealized net gains on securities available for sale were $680 million at December 31, 2007, up from $581 million at September 30, 2007. "We continued to maintain a relatively low-risk, highly liquid and very valuable available for sale portfolio," said Atkins.
Noninterest expense increased $489 million, or 9 percent, from fourth quarter 2006 and increased $229 million from third quarter 2007. Noninterest expense for fourth quarter 2007 included $43 million in integration and severance costs, as well as $33 million in expenses reflecting the Company's proportionate share of Visa's accrual for certain additional litigation matters. As previously reported, the Company revised its third quarter 2007 results to reflect $170 million of litigation expenses associated with indemnification obligations arising from the Company's ownership interest in Visa. "We continued to invest in our people and our businesses in 2007, opening 87 regional banking stores," said Atkins. "Despite these investments, our efficiency ratio was 57.8 percent in fourth quarter 2007, of which 60 basis points was due to the acquisition of Greater Bay Bancorp and related integration expense."
Noninterest Expense
The Company's effective tax rate for full year 2007 was 30.70 percent compared with 33.44 percent for 2006. Income tax expense for 2007 included FIN 48 tax benefits of $235 million, of which $130 million was in the fourth quarter, as well as the impact of lower pre-tax earnings in relation to the level of tax-exempt income and tax credits. The tax benefits recorded in 2007 primarily related to the resolution of certain matters with federal and state taxing authorities and statute expirations,

"2007 was a challenging year for credit," said Chief Credit Officer Mike Loughlin. "We largely avoided many higher-risk wholesale and consumer loan products and practices that are problematic to the industry. However, we did not fully appreciate the severity of the residential real estate downturn and its impact on our home equity portfolio, particularly our third party-originated, higher loan-to-value second mortgages." The fourth quarter 2007 provision was $2.6 billion, which included fourth quarter 2007 net charge-offs of $1.2 billion and the previously disclosed $1.4 billion fourth quarter credit reserve build, largely for losses in the National Home Equity Group (Home Equity) portfolio, particularly in discontinued third party origination channels.
Credit Quality
Fourth quarter 2007 net charge-offs were $1.21 billion (1.28 percent of average total loans, annualized) compared with $892 million (1.01 percent) in third quarter 2007 and $726 million (0.92 percent) in fourth quarter 2006.
Net Charge-offs: Fourth Quarter 2007
"Credit performance within the overall portfolio varied by loan type," said Loughlin. Commercial and commercial real estate charge-offs increased $77 million, almost entirely due to the commercial category, largely consisting of charge-offs on loans originated through our business direct channel. Business direct consists primarily of unsecured lines of credit to small firms and sole proprietors. These lines tend to perform in a manner similar to credit cards. The remaining balance of commercial (other real estate mortgage, real estate construction and lease financing) continued to have extremely low charge-off rates. While real estate 1-4 family first mortgage charge-off rates increased in the fourth quarter in the aggregate, total charge-offs were very low, only $34 million on a $71 billion portfolio. Credit card charge-offs increased $47 million in the quarter, about one-third of which was due to growth. After having been at uncharacteristically low levels, card charge-off rates increased to 5 percent in the fourth quarter and were largely in line with industry standards, reflecting some stress on the consumer. Charge-offs in other revolving credit and installment loans,
 
largely in the auto portfolio, increased to $421 million in the fourth quarter. The $28 million increase in auto charge-offs in the fourth quarter was consistent with historical, second half of the year seasonal trends.
Charge-offs in the real estate 1-4 family junior lien category, primarily Home Equity loans, increased $124 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to Home Equity losses. The large and rapid deterioration in residential real estate values in many markets led to greater loss severity in our higher loan-to-value portfolio segments. As previously disclosed, the Company identified approximately $12 billion of higher-loss content Home Equity loans, primarily sourced through third party originators, which were segregated into a liquidating portfolio for dedicated account management and collections. The liquidating portfolio produced $47.6 million in net charge-offs for the month of December, 2007 with an annualized loss rate of 4.80 percent compared with 0.86 percent for the remaining portfolio during December. Details are provided in the table below.
Home Equity Portfolios as of December 31, 2007
* Combined loan to value ratio greater than 90% based primarily on automated appraisal updates as of September 30, 2007
Full year 2007 net charge-offs were $3.54 billion (1.03 percent of average total loans) compared with $2.25 billion (0.73 percent) during 2006. Total wholesale charge-offs (excluding business direct) were 0.08 percent of total loans, and remained at historically low levels. Total 2007 charge-offs increased $78 million from prior year, centered in residential real estate construction and industries related to home building. Home Equity charge-offs totaled $595 million (0.73 percent of average Home Equity loans) in 2007 compared with $110 million (0.14 percent) in 2006. "The majority of the Home Equity charge-offs were centered in the indirect origination and 90 percent or greater combined loan-to-value portfolios where we have discontinued activities and segregated the loans into the liquidating portfolio," said Loughlin. "We also experienced increased charge-offs in our unsecured consumer portfolios, in part due to growth and in part due to increased economic stress in households. Full year 2007 auto charge-offs were $1.02 billion (3.45 percent of average auto loans) compared with $857 million (3.15 percent) in 2006. These results were consistent with our expectations and represent a stabilization of new business originations and collections activities within this business. Given the weakness in housing and overall state of the U.S. economy, it is likely that net charge-offs will be higher in 2008."
Net Charge-offs: 2007
 
Total nonperforming assets were $3.87 billion (1.01 percent of loans) at December 31, 2007, and included $2.68 billion of nonperforming loans, $535 million of fully insured Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) repurchases, and $649 million of foreclosed real estate and repossessed vehicles. This compares with $3.18 billion (0.88 percent) at September 30, 2007, consisting of $2.09 billion of nonperforming loans, $487 million of GNMA repurchases and $603 million of foreclosed and repossessed assets.
Nonperforming Assets
"The majority of the increase in nonperforming assets was concentrated in the first mortgage loan portfolio ($132 million in Wells Fargo Home Mortgage and $230 million in Wells Fargo Financial real estate) and was due to the national rise in foreclosure rates," said Loughlin. "Additionally, due to illiquid market conditions, we have decided to hold more foreclosed properties than we have historically."
Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing totaled $6.39 billion, $5.53 billion, and $5.07 billion at December 31, 2007, September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. For the same periods, the total included $4.83 billion, $4.26 billion and $3.91 billion, respectively, in advances pursuant to our servicing agreement to GNMA mortgage pools whose repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Department of Veteran Affairs.
Loans 90 Days or More Past Due and Still Accruing (Excluding Insured/Guaranteed GNMA Balances)
The allowance for credit losses, including unfunded credit commitments, was $5.52 billion at December 31, 2007, an increase of $1.50 billion, or 37 percent, from the prior quarter, attributable to the $1.4 billion credit reserve build, and loan loss reserves from the Greater Bay Bancorp acquisition. "The $5.52 billion allowance provides increased coverage of loans outstanding," said Loughlin. "We believe the allowance is adequate for losses inherent in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2007."
Allowance for Credit Losses
 
Wells Fargo has three lines of business for management reporting: Community Banking, Wholesale Banking and Wells Fargo Financial. Net income of the three business segments was:

More financial information about the business segments is on pages 28 and 29.
Community Banking
offers a complete line of diversified financial products and services for consumers and small businesses including investment, insurance and trust services primarily in 23 midwestern and western states, and mortgage and home equity loans in all 50 states.
Community Banking reported net income of $5.29 billion for 2007 (including the $1.4 billion pre-tax credit reserve build), down from $5.55 billion for 2006. Pre-tax pre-provision profit (revenue less noninterest expense) increased $1.42 billion, or 16 percent, from 2006. Revenue growth of 11 percent was driven by loan growth of 9 percent and double-digit fee income growth. Noninterest expense for 2007 increased 8 percent (3 percentage points less than revenue, representing positive operating leverage) driven by investments in technology, distribution and sales staff. The provision for credit losses for 2007 increased $2.3 billion from 2006, including the $1.4 billion credit reserve build.
Regional Banking highlights
 
"Thanks to our dedicated Regional Banking team, focused on our vision of earning all of our customers' business, we provided a record 19.7 million core product solutions in 2007, up 11 percent from 2006 on a comparable basis," said Carrie Tolstedt, senior EVP, Community Banking. "Our retail bank household cross-sell was 5.5, nearly 1 in 4 households have 8 or more products, and 69 percent of new checking account customers purchased . Sales of store-based business solutions increased 16 percent from 2006 on a comparable basis, and sales of rose 30 percent. We know our talented and dedicated team members drive our success. In 2007, our team member engagement ratio rose to over 8.5 to 1, up from 7.1 to 1 in 2006. Five years ago, it was 2.5 to 1. We continue to focus on the customer experience, performing 50,000 store-based customer surveys per month. We've now completed over two million surveys since we began surveying four years ago. For customers transacting at the teller line, welcoming and wait time survey scores were up 11 percent and customer loyalty scores improved 7 percent from 2006. In 2007, we opened 87 banking stores and converted 39 stores from Placer Sierra Bancshares and 3 stores purchased from National City Bank, bringing our total retail store count to 3,298. We welcomed Greater Bay Bancorp to our team in the fourth quarter, with conversion to our network planned for early in 2008. To better serve our customers, we added 153 machines and converted 908 to machines bringing our total to 1,314 primarily in Northern California."

Home Mortgage and Home Equity highlights
"Despite the sharp downturn in housing and the disruption in the secondary markets, our home mortgage businesses performed relatively well compared with many of the players in the industry," said Mark Oman, senior EVP, Home and Consumer Finance Group. "During the year, our teams have taken the appropriate actions to reduce credit and capital markets risk, lower our cost structures, and strengthen our mortgage sales force by selectively hiring highly-successful sales representatives from our competitors. Total fourth quarter originations declined 20 percent from 2006 to $56 billion, primarily reflecting actions we took to exit or reduce volume in third party channels for non-prime, non-conforming and home equity products. Retail mortgage originations declined only 3 percent in the quarter. In 2007, we again benefited from a balanced business model. As origination volumes have slowed, so have servicing prepayments. As a result, we continued to grow the servicing business, with our owned servicing portfolio reaching $1.53 trillion at year-end, up 12 percent from 2006. We also continued to work hard to keep customers in their homes. Our foreclosure rate remained well below industry averages, and we were a leader in HOPE NOW, a new national alliance of mortgage counselors, mortgage servicers, capital markets, investors and the group government to help at-risk homeowners facing foreclosure or higher adjustable rate mortgage resets."

Wholesale Banking
serves customers coast to coast
including middle market banking, corporate banking, commercial real estate, treasury management, asset-based lending, insurance brokerage, foreign exchange, trade services, specialized lending, equipment finance, capital markets activities and asset management.
"Our Wholesale Banking team achieved outstanding results," said Dave Hoyt, senior EVP, Wholesale Banking Group. "For the 14 consecutive quarter, we achieved double-digit, year-over-year growth in loans. Despite unsettled financial market conditions, we continued to build deeper relationships with our customers, with an average of 6.1 products per wholesale relationship and over 7.6 products per middle market commercial relationship. We continued to grow market share by adding more offices, introducing new products and services, and attracting talented professionals to help our customers succeed financially. We achieved record revenue in sales of foreign exchange and interest rate risk management products.
th
"Many of our customers are experiencing benefits of electronically scanning and sending their checks via internet for deposit with us safely and securely, surpassing the volume of paper check
 
deposits for the first time. On several days in October, we processed electronically more than one million check images and more than $2 billion in deposits in a single day. We received 106 million checks electronically in 2007, more than three times 2006, and $254 billion was deposited electronically in 2007, more than double the volume in 2006."
Wholesale Banking's net income was $590 million and $2.3 billion in fourth quarter and full year 2007, respectively, up 20 percent and 13 percent, for the same periods from a year ago. Fourth quarter 2007 revenue increased 14 percent to $2.1 billion and full year revenue was up 15 percent, driven by strong loan and deposit growth and higher fee income. Average loans grew to $95.1 billion, up 27 percent from a year ago, including $2.6 billion from the CIT Construction acquisition, as well as double-digit increases across nearly all wholesale lending businesses. Average core deposits were $61.5 billion, up 40 percent from a year ago, all in interest-bearing balances. Noninterest income increased $113 million from fourth quarter 2006 due to higher trust and investment income (reflecting a 16 percent increase in assets under management), deposit service charges, foreign exchange and insurance, partially offset by a lower level of capital markets and commercial real estate brokerage activity given challenges in certain sectors of the market environment. Noninterest expense increased $107 million from a year ago, mainly due to higher personnel-related costs, including additional team members and higher incentive expenses, as well as commissions and other expenses directly related to higher sales volumes, continued investments, and acquisitions.
Wells Fargo Financial
offers consumer loans primarily through real estate-secured debt consolidation products, automobile financing, consumer and private-label credit cards and commercial services to consumers and businesses throughout the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and the Pacific Rim.
Wells Fargo Financial's net income in the fourth quarter was $78 million, down $80 million from a year ago when the Company completed the final portion of its divestiture of some of its Latin American operations. For the full year, net income was $481 million, down from $852 million last year, in part as a result of the Latin American sale and a $50 million reversal of Hurricane Katrina-related reserves both in 2006, while 2007 included higher losses and slower growth in the auto portfolio.
"Our real estate-secured portfolio, largely consisting of $24 billion of debt-consolidation loans in the U.S., continued to experience solid growth, in part due to lower levels of prepayments," said Tom Shippee, president and CEO of Wells Fargo Financial. "Overall credit quality on this real estate-secured portfolio remained good, with losses of only $18 million in the fourth quarter,
 
although delinquencies and nonaccrual loans did increase in the quarter, reflecting some signs of consumer stress.
"Results in 2007 were significantly impacted by the auto business stemming from a decision in late 2006 to slow the growth rate of this business in order to concentrate on reducing losses, delinquencies, and to improve the loan collection process. Growth in losses did slow in 2007, delinquencies remained lower than a year ago - although they increased somewhat late in the year primarily due to seasonality - and the targeted improvements in the collection process have now been completed. While overall risk in this business has been reduced, revenue growth has moderated as we slowed the business down.
"As the year progressed, we focused on aggressively managing costs on several fronts, including closing 89 consumer stores in the U.S. and 16 in Canada, representing a 9 percent reduction in our store network. This was made possible by the consolidation of our auto lending and consumer lending platforms in 2006, which helped eliminate redundancies and provided for more efficient use of store space, without reducing the total sales force. Full year expenses grew only 9 percent, with a 5 percent increase in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago, which was less than half the rate of our fourth quarter receivables growth."

This news release contains forward-looking statements about the Company, including the statements that we believe the allowance for credit losses was adequate for losses inherent in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2007 and that net charge-offs will likely be higher in 2008 than they were in 2007.
