If the firm or firms listed in Schedule II hereto include only the firm or firms listed in Schedule I hereto, then the terms "Underwriters" and "Representative", as used herein, shall each be deemed to refer to such firm or firms.
The Normal PPS will be guaranteed (the "Guarantee") by Wells Fargo & Company, a Delaware corporation ("Wells Fargo" or the "Guarantor"), to the extent described in a Guarantee Agreement to be dated as of May 19, 2008 (the "Guarantee Agreement") between the Guarantor and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Guarantee Trustee"). The Trust will use the proceeds from the sale of the Normal PPS and the sale of the Trust Common Securities (as defined below) pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement to be dated as of May 19, 2008 between the Trust and the Guarantor (the "Note Purchase Agreement"), to purchase from the Guarantor $2,500,100,000 aggregate principal amount of its Remarketable 7.50% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2044 (the "Notes") to be issued under an Indenture dated as of August 1, 2005 between the Guarantor and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (successor to J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association), as trustee (the "Note Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 5, 2006, the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 25, 2007, the Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 12, 2008 and the Fourth Supplemental Indenture to be dated as of May 19, 2008 between
the Guarantor and the Note Trustee (collectively, the "Indenture"). The Guarantor will also be the holder of one hundred percent of the common securities representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust (the "Trust Common Securities").
The Trust will contemporaneously enter into (i) a Stock Purchase Contract Agreement (the "Stock Purchase Contract Agreement") with the Guarantor, pursuant to which the Trust will agree to purchase 25,001 Stock Purchase Contracts (each a "Stock Purchase Contract"), each having a stated amount of $100,000 and obligating the Trust to purchase from the Guarantor, and the Guarantor to sell to the Trust, subject to the terms thereof, one share of the Guarantor's Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, $100,000 liquidation preference per share (the "Preferred Stock"), on the Stock Purchase Date provided for (and as defined) in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, and (ii) a Collateral Agreement (the "Collateral Agreement") with Wilmington Trust Company, as collateral agent (the " Collateral Agent "), registrar and transfer agent (the "Transfer Agent") and custodial agent (the "Custodial Agent"), under which the Trust will initially pledge the Notes to secure its obligation to purchase Preferred Stock under the Stock Purchase Contracts.
The Trust was created under Delaware law pursuant to a Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement dated as of April 22, 2004 executed by Wells Fargo, as depositor, and by Richard D. Levy and Saturnino S. Fanlo, as administrative trustees of the Trust and by Wilmington Trust Company, as Delaware trustee (the "Delaware Trustee"), as amended by the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement (the "Trust Agreement") among Wells Fargo, the administrative trustees named therein (the "Administrative Trustees"), the Delaware Trustee and the property trustee named therein (the "Property Trustee") to be dated as of May 19, 2008.

(a) The Trust and the Guarantor jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement for the registration of the Normal PPS and the Related Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party to the extent set forth below, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Trust and the Guarantor will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Trust or the Guarantor by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for use therein (it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of such information described as such in the Blood Letter). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Trust or the Guarantor may otherwise have.
provided
however
 
(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Trust, the Administrative Trustees, the Guarantor, each of their directors, each of the Guarantor's officers and the Trust's representative who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Trust or the Guarantor within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Trust and the Guarantor to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Trust or the Guarantor by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representative for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity (it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of such information described as such in the Blood Letter). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental investigation), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it shall wish, jointly, with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party). In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to obtain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts of interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate identified firm (in addition to any identified local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representative in the case of parties to be indemnified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 7 and by the Guarantor in the case of parties to be indemnified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 7. An indemnifying party
 
shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its prior written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of the indemnified party.
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 7(a) or 7(b) hereof is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Trust and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and each Underwriter, on the other hand, from the offering of such Normal PPS or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Trust and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and each Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Trust and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and each Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of such Normal PPS shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Normal PPS (before deducting expenses) received by the Trust bear to the total discounts and commissions received by each Underwriter in respect thereof. The relative fault of the Trust and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and each Underwriter, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Trust and the Guarantor or by such Underwriter and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. Each Underwriter's obligation to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 shall be several in the proportion that the number of Normal PPS the sale of which by such Underwriter gave rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities bears to the aggregate number of Normal PPS the sale of which by all Underwriters gave rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, and not joint.
 
(e) The Trust and the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to Section 7(d) hereof were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d) hereof. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 7(d) hereof shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Normal PPS referred to in Section 7(d) hereof that were offered and sold to the public through such Underwriter exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
pro rata
8. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Normal PPS agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the number of Normal PPS set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bear to the aggregate number of Normal PPS set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Normal PPS which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate number of Normal PPS which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate number of Normal PPS set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of such Normal PPS; , that if the remaining Underwriters do not exercise their right to purchase such Normal PPS and arrangements for the purchase of such Normal PPS satisfactory to the Trust and the Guarantor and the Representative are not made within 36 hours after such default, then this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter, the Trust and the Guarantor. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representative shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Trust or the Guarantor and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Senior Counsel of Wells Fargo & Company (the "Company") and, as such, I, together with other attorneys in the Wells Fargo Law Department, have acted as counsel for the Company in connection with the preparation of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement") of the Company and Wells Fargo Capital X, Wells Fargo Capital XI, Wells Fargo Capital XII, Wells Fargo Capital XIII, Wells Fargo Capital XIV, Wells Fargo Capital XV, Wells Fargo Capital XVI, Wells Fargo Capital XVII, Wells Fargo Capital XVIII, Wells Fargo Capital XIX and Wells Fargo Capital XX filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to the proposed offer and sale from time to time of the securities referred to therein, and a Prospectus Supplement dated May 12, 2008 to the Prospectus dated May 12, 2008 (together, the "Prospectus") relating to the offer and sale by the Company under the Registration Statement of (i) $2,500,100,000 aggregate principal amount of Remarketable 7.50% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2044 (the "Notes"), and (ii) 25,001 stock purchase contracts (the "Stock Purchase Contracts"), each having a stated amount of $100,000. The Notes are to be issued under the Indenture dated as of August 1, 2005, as supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 19, 2008 (the "Indenture") entered into by the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (successor in interest to J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association), as trustee, and sold by the Company to Wells Fargo Capital XIII (the "Trust") pursuant to the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement dated May 19, 2008. The Stock Purchase Contracts obligate the Trust to purchase from the Company, and the Company to sell to the Trust, subject to the terms thereof, one share of the Company's Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, $100,000 liquidation preference per share, on the Stock Purchase Date provided for and defined in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement dated May 19, 2008 between the Company and the Trust (the "Stock Purchase Contract Agreement").
I, or attorneys in the Wells Fargo Law Department under my direction, have examined such documents, records, and instruments as I have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.

Based on the foregoing, I am of the opinion that (i) the Notes have been duly authorized and, when duly executed by the Company, authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, and delivered to and paid for by the Trust, the Notes will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, and (ii) the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trust) constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, in each case subject, as to their legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and subject to general equity principles (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and except further as enforcement thereof may be limited by any governmental authority that limits, delays or prohibits the making of payments outside the United States.
I have relied as to certain relevant facts upon certificates of, and/or information provided by officers and employees of the Company as to the accuracy of such factual matters without independent verification thereof or other investigation. I have also relied, without investigation, upon the following assumptions: (i) natural persons acting on behalf of the Company have sufficient legal capacity to enter into and perform, on behalf of the Company, the transaction in question; (ii) each party to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreements or instruments enforceable against it; (iii) each party to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company has complied with all legal requirements pertaining to its status as such status relates to its rights to enforce such agreements or instruments against the Company; (iv) each document submitted to me for review is accurate and complete, each such document that is an original is authentic, each such document that is a copy conforms to an authentic original, and all signatures on each such document are genuine; (v) there has not been any mutual mistake of fact or misunderstanding, fraud, duress or undue influence; and (vi) all statutes, judicial and administrative decisions, and rules and regulations of governmental agencies, constituting the law of the opining jurisdictions, are publicly available to lawyers practicing in Minnesota.
Without limiting any other qualifications set forth herein, the opinions expressed herein regarding the enforceability of each of the Notes and the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement are subject to the effect of generally applicable laws that (i) provide for the enforcement of oral waivers or modifications where a material change of position in reliance thereon has occurred or provide that a course of performance may operate as a waiver, (ii) limit the availability of a remedy under certain circumstances where another remedy has been elected, (iii) may, where less than all of a contract may be unenforceable, limit the enforceability of the balance of the contract to circumstances in which the unenforceable portion is not an essential part of the agreed exchange, (iv) govern and afford judicial discretion regarding the determination of damages and entitlement to attorneys' fees and other costs, (v) may permit a party who has materially failed to render or offer performance required by a contract to cure that failure unless either permitting a cure would unreasonably hinder the aggrieved party from making substitute arrangements for performance or it is important under the circumstances to the aggrieved party that performance occur by the date stated in the contract, (vi) may require mitigation of damages,

(vii) may limit the enforceability of provisions imposing increased interest rates or late payment charges upon delinquency in payment or default or providing for liquidated damages or for premiums upon acceleration, and (viii) may limit the enforceability of provisions waiving the right to jury trial.
I express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of Minnesota, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and the federal laws of the United States of America. I express no opinion as to whether, or the extent to which, the laws of any particular jurisdiction apply to the subject matter hereof, including, without limitation, the enforceability of the governing law provision contained in the Notes or the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement. Because the governing law provision of each of the Notes and the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement relates to the law of a jurisdiction as to which I express no opinion, the opinion regarding enforceability of the Notes and the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement set forth herein is given as if the law of the State of Minnesota governs the Notes and the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the opinions expressed do not address the need for future authorization by the Company of the issuance of securities in connection with various covenants contained in the Indenture, the Notes, the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement or the Stock Purchase Contracts.
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company filed with the Commission and thereby incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement. In giving such consent, I do not thereby admit that I am in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act.

For purposes of this opinion, we have not reviewed any documents other than the documents listed in paragraphs (a) through (d) above. In particular, we have not reviewed any document (other than the documents listed in paragraphs (a) through (d) above) that is referred to in or incorporated by reference into the documents reviewed by us. We have assumed that there exists no provision in any document that we have not reviewed that is inconsistent with the opinions stated herein. We have conducted no independent factual investigation of our own but rather have relied solely upon the foregoing documents, the statements and information set forth therein and the additional matters recited or assumed herein, all of which we have assumed to be true, complete and accurate in all material respects.
With respect to all documents examined by us, we have assumed (i) the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as authentic originals, (ii) the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies or forms, and (iii) the genuineness of all signatures.
For purposes of this opinion, we have assumed (i) that the Trust Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties thereto with respect to the subject matter thereof, including with respect to the creation, operation and termination of the Trust, and that each of the Trust Agreement and the Certificate of Trust is in full force and effect and has not been amended, (ii) except to the extent provided in paragraph 1 below, the due creation or due organization or due formation, as the case may be, and valid existence in good standing of each party to the documents examined by us under the laws of the jurisdiction governing its creation, organization or formation, (iii) the legal capacity of natural persons who are parties to the documents examined by us, (iv) except to the extent provided in paragraph 1 below, that each of the parties to the documents examined by us has the power and authority to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, such documents, (v) except to the extent provided in paragraph 2 below, the due authorization, execution and delivery by all parties thereto of all documents examined by us, (vi) the receipt by each Person to whom a Capital Security is to be issued by the Trust (collectively, the "Capital Security Holders") of a Capital

Securities Certificate for such Capital Security and the payment for the Capital Security acquired by it, in accordance with the Trust Agreement and the Underwriting Agreement, and (vii) that the Capital Securities are issued and sold to the Capital Security Holders in accordance with the Trust Agreement and the Underwriting Agreement, and as described in the Prospectus. We have not participated in the preparation of the Registration Statement, except for this opinion, or Prospectus and assume no responsibility for their contents.
This opinion is limited to the laws of the State of Delaware (excluding the securities laws of the State of Delaware), and we have not considered and express no opinion on the laws of any other jurisdiction, including federal laws and rules and regulations relating thereto. Our opinions are rendered only with respect to Delaware laws and rules, regulations and orders thereunder which are currently in effect.
Based upon the foregoing, and upon our examination of such questions of law and statutes of the State of Delaware as we have considered necessary or appropriate, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and exceptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
1. The Trust has been duly formed and is validly existing in good standing as a statutory trust under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, 12 Del. C.  3801, et seq., and has the trust power and authority to issue the Capital Securities.
2. The Capital Securities of the Trust have been duly authorized by the Trust Agreement and, when executed and delivered in accordance with the Trust Agreement and the Underwriting Agreement, will be duly and validly issued and, subject to the qualifications set forth in paragraph 3 below, fully paid and non-assessable undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust.
3. The Capital Security Holders, as beneficial owners of the Trust, will be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. We note that the Capital Security Holders may be obligated to make certain payments under the Trust Agreement.
We consent to the filing of this opinion with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K and its incorporation by reference into the Registration Statement. In giving the foregoing consent, we do not

(ii) such amendment or supplement is not adverse to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt and an officer of the Corporation has delivered to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt in the manner provided for in the indenture, fiscal agency agreement or other instrument with respect to such Covered Debt a written certificate stating that, in his or her determination, such amendment or supplement is not adverse to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt;

(iv) the effect of such amendment or supplement is to postpone the termination of this Replacement Capital Covenant.
For the avoidance of doubt, an amendment or supplement that adds new types of Qualifying Capital Securities or modifies the requirements of the Qualifying Capital Securities described herein would not be adverse to the rights of the Covered Debtholders if, following such amendment or supplement, this Replacement Capital Covenant would satisfy clause (b) of the definition of Qualifying Replacement Capital Covenant.
(c) For purposes of Sections 4(a) and 4(b), the Holders whose consent or agreement is required to terminate, amend or supplement the obligations of the Corporation under this Replacement Capital Covenant shall be the Holders of the then-effective Covered Debt as of a record date established by the Corporation that is not more than 30 days prior to the date on which the Corporation proposes that such termination, amendment or supplement becomes effective.
