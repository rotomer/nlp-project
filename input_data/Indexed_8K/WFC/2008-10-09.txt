     Agreement and Plan of Merger
            
On October 3, 2008, Wells Fargo & Company ("Wells Fargo" or the "Company") and Wachovia Corporation ("Wachovia") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company will merge with and into Wachovia (the "Merger") with Wachovia continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
            
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, if the Merger is completed, each share of Wachovia common stock will be converted into 0.1991 (the "Exchange Ratio") of a share of the Company's common stock. Preferred stock of Wachovia will be exchanged for preferred stock issued by the Company having substantially identical terms. In addition, as of consummation of the Merger, outstanding Wachovia stock options and other stock-based awards will be converted into stock options and other stock-based awards with respect to shares of the Company's common stock, with adjustments to reflect the Exchange Ratio.
            
The Merger Agreement, included as Exhibit 2.1, contains (a) customary representations and warranties of Wachovia and Wells Fargo, including, among others, with respect to corporate organization, capitalization, corporate authority, third party and governmental consents and approvals, reports and regulatory matters, financial statements, and compliance with law and legal proceedings; (b) covenants of Wachovia and Wells Fargo to conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course until the Merger is completed; and (c) covenants of Wachovia and Wells Fargo not to take certain actions during such period. Wachovia has also agreed not to (i) solicit proposals relating to alternative business combination transactions or (ii) subject to certain exceptions, enter into discussions concerning, or provide confidential information in connection with, any proposals for alternative business combination transactions.
            
The representations and warranties of each party set forth in the Merger Agreement have been made solely for the benefit of the other party to the Merger Agreement. In addition, such representations and warranties (a) have been qualified by confidential disclosures made to the other party in connection with the Merger Agreement, (b) will not survive consummation of the Merger and cannot be the basis for any claims under the Merger Agreement by the other party after termination of the Merger Agreement except as a result of a knowing breach as of the date of the Merger Agreement, (c) are subject to materiality qualifications contained in the Merger Agreement which may differ from what may be viewed as material by investo rs, (d) were made only as of the date of the Merger Agreement or such other date as is specified in the Merger Agreement, and (e) may have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating risk between the Company and Wachovia rather than establishing matters as facts. Accordingly, the Merger Agreement is included with this filing only to provide investors with information regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement, and not to provide investors with any other factual information regarding the parties or their respective businesses. The Merger Agreement should not be read alone, but should instead be read in conjunction with the other information regarding the companies and the Merger that will be contained in, or incorporated by reference into, the proxy statement-prospectus that the parties will be filing in connection with the Merger, as well as in the Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other documents that each of the Company and Wachovia file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (" SEC").
            
The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted a resolution approving the issuance of the Company's common stock in the Merger. The Board of Directors of Wachovia has adopted a resolution recommending approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement by its shareholders and Wachovia has agreed to submit the Merger Agreement to its shareholders for consideration.
            
Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain customary conditions, including, among others, approval of the shareholders of Wachovia, governmental filings and regulatory approvals and expiration of applicable waiting periods, accuracy of specified representations and warranties of the other party, and material compliance by the other party with its obligations under the Merger Agreement.
            
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for Wachovia and the Company, as the case may be, applicable upon: final, non-appealable denial of required regulatory approvals or injunction (including any injunction prohibiting the issuance of shares of Series M Preferred Stock pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement (described below) or that prevents the Company from voting such shares in favor of approving and adopting the Merger Agreement); the first anniversary of the date of the Merger Agreement if the Merger has not been completed by that time; a breach by the other party that is not or cannot be cured within 60 days' notice of such breach if such breach would result in a failure of the conditions to closing set forth in the Merger Agreement; if Wachovia's shareholders fail to approve the transaction by the required vote; or a failure by the Board of Directors of Wachovia to recommend the Merger to its shareholders.
            
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto, and is incorporated into this report by reference.
Share Exchange Agreement
    
            
On October 3, 2008, the Company and Wachovia, in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, entered into a Share Exchange Agreement, under which the Company agreed to acquire 10 newly issued shares of Series M Preferred Stock of Wachovia, representing 39.9% of the aggregate voting power exercisable by Wachovia's common shareholders and the Company as holder of the Series M Preferred Stock, in exchange for the issuance of 1,000 shares of the Company's common stock to Wachovia.

Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by its Certificate or Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to, this Article II.

To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be.
     
     
(e)After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time.

(g)Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of Company as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time may be paid to Parent.

(e)     Without limiting the generality of Section 9.9, the provisions of this Section 6.5 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, director or independent contractor or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan for any purpose.

(c)     Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 6.6(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation described above, will promptly notify Parent;
provided
