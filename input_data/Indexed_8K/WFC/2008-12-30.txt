     RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority vested in the Committee and in accordance with the resolutions of the Board of Directors dated October 2, 2008, the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the By-laws of the Corporation and applicable law, a series of Preferred Stock, no par value, of the Corporation be and hereby is created, and that the designation and number of shares of such series, and the voting and other powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, of the shares of such series, are as follows:

          (b) DEPs redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (other than in a bona fide fiduciary capacity) shall be cancelled and may not be reissued. DEPs may be issued in fractional shares which are whole number multiples of one one-millionth of a share, which fractional shares shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional share, to all rights of a holder of a whole share of DEPs.
          
(c) DEPs shall, with respect to distributions upon the liquidation, winding-up and dissolution of the Corporation, rank (x) senior to the Common Stock for the Liquidation Preference stated and defined in Section 3(a) below and (y) junior to each class or series of preferred stock issued in exchange for preferred stock of Wachovia Corporation established by the board of directors of Wachovia Corporation after September 1, 2001 and each class or series of preferred stock established by the Board of Directors after the date hereof.
     
2.
Dividends
. DEPs shall not entitle the holders thereof to any dividends, whether payable in cash, property, stock or otherwise.
     3.
Liquidation
.
          
(a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of full and fractional DEPs shall be entitled, before any distribution or payment is made on any date to the holders of the Common Stock or any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the DEPs upon liquidation, to be paid in full an amount per whole share of DEPs equal to $10.00 (the "Liquidation Preference"), together with accrued dividends to such distribution or payment date, whether or not earned or declared. If such payment shall have been made in full to all holders of DEPs, the holders of DEPs as such shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation.
          
(b) In the event the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to the holders of DEPs upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 3(a), no such distribution shall be made on account of any shares of any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the DEPs upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up unless proportionate distributive amounts shall be paid on account of the DEPs, ratably in proportion to the full distributable amounts for which holders of all such parity shares are respectively entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.
          
(c) Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of DEPs then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its shareholders all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the first paragraph of this Section 3 before any payment shall be made to the holders of Common Stock or any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior upon liquidation to the DEPs.
          
(d) For the purposes of this Section 3, the consolidation or merger of, or binding statutory share exchange by, the Corporation with any other corporation shall not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.
     4.
Redemption, Conversion, Exchange
.
          
(a) The DEPs shall not be convertible or exchangeable. Other than as described in the next sentence, the DEPs shall not be redeemable. The DEPs shall be redeemable

(b) In case of redemption of less than all of the DEPs at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata or by lot as determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion, provided that the Corporation may redeem all shares held by holders of fewer than 0.100 DEPs (or by holders that would hold fewer than 0.100 DEPs following such redemption) prior to its redemption of other DEPs.
          
(c) Notice of any redemption shall be sent by or on behalf of the Corporation no less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date specified for redemption in such notice (the "Redemption Date"), by first class mail, postage prepaid, to all holders of record of the DEPs at their last addresses as they appear on the books of the Corporation; provided, however, that no failure to give such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any DEPs except as to the holder to whom the Corporation has failed to give notice or except as to the holder to whom notice was defective. In addition to any information required by applicable law or regulation or the rules of any exchange upon which the DEPs may be listed or admitted to trading, such notice shall state (1) that such redemption is being made pu rsuant to the redemption provisions of this Section 5, (2) the Redemption Date, (3) the redemption price, (4) the total number of DEPs to be redeemed and, if less than all shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed, and (5) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price, including any procedures applicable to redemption to be accomplished through book-entry transfers. Upon the mailing of any such notice of redemption, the Corporation shall become obligated to redeem, on the Redemption Date, all shares called for redemption.

On or after the Redemption Date, the Series G Preferred Stock called for redemption shall automatically, and without further action on the part of the holder thereof, be deemed to have been redeemed and the former holder thereof shall thereupon only be entitled to receive payment of the Redemption Price. If such notice of redemption shall have been given as aforesaid, and if on or before the Red emption Date the funds necessary for the redemption shall have been set aside so as to be available therefore, then the dividends thereon shall cease to accrue after the Redemption Date and all rights with respect to the Series G Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall forthwith after such Redemption Date cease, except the right of the holders to receive the Redemption Price, without interest.

The Corporation shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Depositary Company, the interest, if any, allowed on such moneys deposited with it, and the holders of any Series G Preferred Stock so redeemed shall have no claim to any such interest. Any moneys so deposited and remaining unclaimed at the end of three years from the Redemption Date shall, if thereafter requested by resolution of the Board of Directors, be repaid to the Corporation, and in the event of such repayment to the Corporation, such holders of record of the Series G Preferred Stock so redeemed which shall not have made claim against such moneys prior to such repayment to the Corporation shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Corporation for an amo unt equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of the Series G Preferred Stock and so repaid to the Corporation, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest.
     
(d) Subject to the provisions herein, the Board of Directors shall have authority to prescribe from time to time the manner in which the Series G Preferred Stock shall be redeemed.
     
(e) Nothing contained herein shall limit any legal right of the Corporation to purchase any shares of the Series G Preferred Stock.

8.
Repurchase
. Subject to the limitations imposed herein, the Corporation may purchase and sell Series G Preferred Stock from time to time to such extent, in such manner, and upon such terms as the Board of Directors may determine;
provided

10.

Any moneys so deposited and remaining unclaimed at the end of three years from the Redemption Date shall, if thereafter requested by resolution of the Board of Directors, be repaid to the Corporation, and in the eve nt of such repayment to the Corporation, such holders of record of the Series H Preferred Stock so redeemed which shall not have made claim against such moneys prior to such repayment to the Corporation shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Corporation for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of the Series H Preferred Stock and so repaid to the Corporation, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest.
     
(e) Subject to the provisions herein, the Board of Directors shall have authority to prescribe from time to time the manner in which the Series H Preferred Stock shall be redeemed.

Voting Rights

(a)
Right To Elect Two Directors Upon Nonpayment Events
. If after the issuance of the Series L Preferred Stock the Corporation fails to pay, or declare and set aside for payment, full dividends on the Series L Preferred Stock or any class or series of Voting Parity Stock for six Dividend Periods or their equivalent (whether or not consecutive) (a "
Nonpayment Event
"), the number of directors then constituting the board of directors shall automatically be increased by two and the holders of Series L Preferred Stock, voting together as a single and separate class with the holders of all o utstanding shares of Voting Parity Stock, shall be entitled to elect the two additional directors (the "
Preferred Stock Directors
") by a plurality of the votes cast; provided that it shall be a qualification for election for any such Preferred Stock Director that the election of such director shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirement of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other securities exchange or other trading facility on which securities of the Corporation may then be listed or traded) that listed or traded companies must have a majority of independent directors; and provided further that the board of directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock Directors (including, for purposes of this limitation, all directors that the holders of any series of Voting Parity Stock are entitled to elect pursuant to like voting rights).
     
In the event that the holders of Series L Preferred Stock and such other holders of Voting Parity Stock shall be entitled to vote for the election of the Preferred Stock Directors following a Nonpayment Event, such directors shall be initially elected following such Nonpayment Event at the Corporation's next annual meeting of shareholders, and, except as provided below, at each subsequent annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation.
     
When dividends have been paid in full on the Series L Preferred Stock and any and all Voting Parity Stock for at least four consecutive Dividend Periods or their equivalent after a Nonpayment Event, then the right of the holders of Series L Preferred Stock to elect the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease (but subject always to revesting of such rights in the case of any future Nonpayment Event), and, if and when all rights of holders of Series L Preferred Stock and Voting Parity Stock to elect the Preferred Stock Directors shall have ceased, the terms of office of all the Preferred Stock Directors shall forthwith terminate and the number of directors constituting the board of directors shall automatically be reduced accordingly.
     
Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series L Preferred Stock and Voting Parity
Stock, when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a single and separate class). In case any vacancy shall occur among the Preferred Stock Directors, a successor shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series L Preferred Stock and Voting Parity Stock having the voting rights described above, voting together as a single and separate class. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter that shall come before the board of directors for a vote.
          
(b)
Other Voting Rights
. So long as any shares of Series L Preferred Stock are outstanding, the vote or consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3 % of the shares of Series L Preferred Stock at the time outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, voting separately as a single class with all other classes or series of preferred stock ranking equally with the Series L Preferred Stock and entitled to vote thereon, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating any of the following actions, whether or not such approval is required by Delaware law:
               (i)

. Any amendment or alteration of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws to authorize, create or increase the authorized amount of, or any issuance of, any shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, any class or series of Capital Stock of the Corporation ranking senior to the Series L Preferred Stock with respect to either the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets in the event of any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, winding-up and liquidation of the affairs of the Corporation; or
               
(iii)
Share Exchanges, Reclassifications, Mergers and Consolidations
. Any consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series L Preferred Stock, or of a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with another Person, unless in each case (x) the shares of Series L Preferred Stock remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Corporation is not the surviving or resulting Person, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting Person or a Person controlling such Person, and (y) such Series L Preferred Stock shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series L Preferred Stock, taken as a whole;
provided
,
however
, that any authorization, creation or increase in the authorized amount of or issuance of Series L Preferred Stock or any class or series of Parity Stock or Junior Stock or any securities convertible into any class or series of Parity Stock (whether dividends payable in respect of such Parity Stock are cumulative or non-cumulative) or Junior Stock will be deemed not to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series L Preferred Stock, and holders of the Series L Preferred Stock shall have no right to vote thereon.
     
If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(b) would adversely affect one or more but not all series of voting preferred stock (including the Series L Preferred Stock), then only those series affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock).
          
(c)
Changes for Clarification
. Without the consent of the holders of Series L Preferred Stock, so long as such action does not adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series L Preferred Stock, the Corporation may amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series L Preferred Stock:
               
(i) to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in this Certificate of Designations that may be defective or inconsistent; or
               
(ii) to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Series L Preferred Stock that is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Certificate of Designations.
          
(d)

. The rules and procedures for calling and conducting any meeting of the holders of Series L Preferred Stock (including, without limitation, the fixing of a record date in connection therewith), the solicitation and use of proxies at such a meeting, the obtaining of written consents and any other aspect or matter with regard to such a meeting or such consents shall be governed by any rules the board of directors, in its discretion, may adopt from time to time, which rules and procedures shall conform to the requirements of the certificate of incorporation, the bylaws, applicable law and any national securities exchange or other trading facility in which the Series L Preferred Stock is listed or traded at the time. Whether the vote or consent of the holders of a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of Series L Preferred Stock and any Voting Parity Stock has been cast or given on any matter on which the holders of shares of Series L Preferred Stock are entitled to vote shall be determined by the Corporation by reference to the specified liquidation amounts of the shares voted or covered by the consent.
     
For purposes of determining the voting rights of the holders of Series L Preferred Stock under this Section 7, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each $1,000 of liquidation preference to which his or her shares are entitled. Holders of shares of Series L Preferred Stock will be entitled to one vote for each such share of Series L Preferred Stock held by them.
     
Section 8.

     Section 13.
Conversion

          (a)
Conversion Procedures

(i) Effective immediately prior to the close of business on the Mandatory Conversion Date or any applicable Conversion Date, dividends shall no longer be declared on any converted shares of Series L Preferred Stock and such shares of Series L Preferred Stock shall cease to be outstanding, in each case, subject to the right of Holders to receive any declared and unpaid dividends on such shares and any other payments to which they are otherwise entitled pursuant to Section 12, Section 13(b), Section 13(c), Section 13(d), Section 15 or Section 16, as applicable.
               
(ii) Prior to the close of business on the Mandatory Conversion Date or any applicable Conversion Date, shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of, or other securities issuable upon conversion of, any shares of Series L Preferred Stock shall not be deemed outstanding for any purpose, and Holders shall have no rights with respect to the Common Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion (including voting rights, rights to respond to tender offers for the Common Stock and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock and/or other securities issuable upon conversion), by virtue of holding shares of Series L Preferred Stock.
               
(iii) The Person or Persons entitled to receive the Common Stock and/or other securities issuable upon conversion of Series L Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of such shares of Common Stock and/or such other securities as of the close of business on the Mandatory Conversion Date or any applicable Conversion Date except to the extent that all or a portion of such Common Stock is subject to the limitations set forth in Section 18. In the event that a Holder shall not by written notice designate the name in which shares of Common Stock and/or cash, other securities or other property (including payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares) to be issued or paid upon conversion of shares of Series L Preferred Stock should be registered or paid or the manner in which such shares should be delivered, the Corporatio n shall be entitled to register and deliver such shares,
and make such payment, in the name of the Holder and in the manner shown on the records of the Corporation through book-entry transfer through the Depositary.
               
(iv) Conversion into shares of Common Stock will occur on the Mandatory Conversion Date or any applicable Conversion Date as follows:
               (A) On the Mandatory Conversion Date or applicable Conversion Date, certificates or evidence of shares in book-entry form representing shares of Common Stock shall be issued and delivered to Holders or their designee upon presentation and surrender of the certificate evidencing the Series L Preferred Stock to the Conversion Agent if shares of the Series L Preferred Stock are held in certificated form, and, if required, the furnishing of appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the payment of all transfer and similar taxes. If a Holder's interest is a beneficial interest in a global certificate representing Series L Preferred Stock, a book-entry transfer through the Depositary will be made by the Conversion Agent upon compliance with the Depositary's procedures for converting a beneficial interest in a global security.
               
(B) On the date of any conversion at the option of Holders pursuant to Section 12, Section 13(c) or Section 13(d), if a Holder's interest is in certificated form, a Holder must do each of the following in order to convert:
(1) complete and manually sign the conversion notice provided by the Conversion Agent, or a facsimile of the conversion notice, and deliver this irrevocable notice to the Conversion Agent;
               
(2) surrender the shares of Series L Preferred Stock to the Conversion Agent;
               
(3) if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents;
               
(4) if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes; and
               
(5) if required, pay funds equal to any declared and unpaid dividend payable on the next Dividend Payment Date.
               
     
If a Holder's interest is a beneficial interest in a global certificate representing Series L Preferred Stock, in order to convert a Holder must comply with clauses (3) through (5) listed above and comply with the Depositary's procedures for converting a beneficial interest in a global security.
     
The date on which a Holder complies with the procedures in this clause (v) is the "Conversion Date."

accordance with the terms of the notice delivered by such Holder described in clause (B) above. If a Conversion Date on which a Holder elects to convert Series L Preferred Stock is prior to the Record Date relating to any declared dividend for the Dividend Period, such Holder will not have the right to receive any declared dividends for that Dividend Period. If a Conversion Date on which a Holder elects to convert Series L Preferred Stock or the Mandatory Conversion Date is after the Record Date for any declared dividend and prior to the Dividend Payment Date, such Holder shall receive that dividend on the relevant Dividend Payment Date if such Holder was the Holder of record on the Record Date for that dividend. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the Conversion Date is after the Record Date and prior to the Dividend Payment Date, whether or not such Holder was the Holder of record on the Record Date, t he Holder must pay to the Conversion Agent upon conversion of the shares of Series L Preferred Stock an amount in cash equal to the full dividend actually paid on the Dividend Payment Date for the then-current Dividend Period on the shares of Series L Preferred Stock being converted, unless the Holder's shares of Series L Preferred Stock are being converted pursuant to Section 13(b), Section 13(c) or Section 13(d).
          (b)
Mandatory Conversion at the Corporation's Option

               (i) On or after March 15, 2013, the Corporation may, at its option, at any time or from time to time, cause some or all of the Series L Preferred Stock to be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Applicable Conversion Rate if, for 20 Trading Days during any period of 30 consecutive Trading Days, including the last Trading Day of such period, the Closing Price of the Common Stock exceeds 130% of the Applicable Conversion Price of the Series L Preferred Stock. The Corporation will provide Notice of Mandatory Conversion as set forth in Section 13(b)(iii) within three Trading Days after the end of the 30 consecutive Trading Day period.
               (ii) If the Corporation elects to cause less than all of the Series L Preferred Stock to be converted under clause (i) above, the Conversion Agent will select the Series L Preferred Stock to be converted by lot, or on a
pro rata
basis or by another method the Conversion Agent considers fair and appropriate, including any method required by the Depositary (so long as such method is not prohibited by the rules of any stock exchange or quotation association on which the Series L Preferred Stock is then traded or quoted). If the Conversion Agent selects a portion of a Holder's Series L Preferred Stock for partial conversion at the Corporation's option and such Holder converts a portion of its shares of Series L Preferred Stock at the same time, the portion converted at such Holder's option will reduce the portion selected for conversion at the Corporation's option under this Section 13(b).
               (iii) If the Corporation exercises the optional conversion right described in this Section 13(b), the Corporation shall give notice (such notice a "
Notice of Mandatory Conversion
") by (i) providing a notice of such conversion by first class mail to each Holder of record for the shares of Series L Preferred Stock to be converted or (ii) issuing a press release and making this information available on its website. The Conversion Date shall be a date selected by the Corporation (the "
Mandatory Conversion Date
"), not less than 10 days, and not more than 20 day s, after the date on which the Corporation provides the Notice of Mandatory
Conversion. In addition to any information required by applicable law or regulation, the Notice of Mandatory Conversion shall state, as appropriate:
               (A) the Mandatory Conversion Date;
               (B) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each share of Series L Preferred Stock; and
               (C) the aggregate number of shares of Series L Preferred Stock to be converted.
          (c)
Conversion upon Make-Whole Acquisition
.
               
(i) In the event of a Make-Whole Acquisition occurring prior to a Mandatory Conversion Date or Conversion Date, each Holder shall have the option to convert its shares of Series L Preferred Stock (a "
Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion
") during the period (the "
Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion Period
") beginning on the effective date of the Make-Whole Acquisition (the "
Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date
") an d ending on the date that is 30 days after the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date and receive an additional number of shares of Common Stock (the "
Make-Whole Shares
") as set forth in clause (ii) below.
               (ii) The number of Make-Whole Shares per share of Series L Preferred Stock shall be determined by reference to the table below for the applicable Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date and the applicable Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price:
               (A) The exact Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Prices and Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Dates may not be set forth in the table, in which case:
               
(1) if the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price is between two Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price amounts in the table or the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date is between two dates in the table, the number of Make-Whole Shares will be determined by straight-line interpolation between the number of Make-Whole Shares set forth for the higher and lower Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price amounts and the two Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
               (2) if the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price is in excess of $502.26 per share (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 14), no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Series L Preferred Stock; and
               (3) if the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price is less than $120.54 per share (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 14), no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Series L Preferred Stock.
               (B) The Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Prices set forth in the table above are subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 14 hereof and shall be adjusted as of any date the Conversion Rate is adjusted. The adjusted Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Prices will equal the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Prices adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. Each of the number of Make-Whole Shares in the table shall also be subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 14.
               
(iii) On or before the twentieth day prior to the date the Corporation anticipates being the effective date for the Make-Whole Acquisition or within two business days of becoming aware of a Make-Whole Acquisition of the type set forth in clause (a) of the definition Make-Whole Acquisition, a written notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the Corporation, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders as they appear in the records of the Corporation.

Such notice shall contain:
               
(A) the date that shall be 30 days after the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date;
               (B) the number of Make-Whole Shares;
               (C) the amount of cash, securities and other consideration receivable by a Holder of Series L Preferred Stock upon conversion; and
               
(D) the instructions a Holder must follow to exercise its conversion option in connection with such Make-Whole Acquisition.
               
(v) To exercise a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option, a Holder must, no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time on or before the date by which the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option must be exercised as specified in the notice delivered under clause (iv) above, comply with the procedures set forth in Section 13(a)(iv)(B).
               
(vi) If a Holder does not elect to exercise the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option in accordance with the provisions specified in this Section 13(c), the shares of Series L Preferred Stock or successor security held by it shall remain outstanding (unless otherwise converted as provided herein), and the Holder will not be eligible to receive Make-Whole Shares.

(viii) In the event that a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion is effected with respect to shares of Series L Preferred Stock or a successor security representing less than all the shares of Series L Preferred Stock or a successor security held by a Holder, upon such Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion the Corporation or its successor shall execute and the Conversion Agent shall, unless otherwise instructed in writing, countersign and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Corporation or its successors, a certificate evidencing the shares of Series L Preferred Stock or such successor security held by the Holder as to which a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion was not effected.
          (d)
Conversion Upon Fundamental Change
.
               
(i) If the Reference Price in connection with a Make-Whole Acquisition is less than $120.54 (a "
Fundamental Change
"), a Holder may elect to convert each share of Series L Preferred Stock during the period beginning on the effective date of the Fundamental Change and ending on the date that is 30 days after the effective date of such Fundamental Change at an adjusted conversion price equal to the greater of (1) the Reference Price and (2) $60.27, subject to adjustment as described in clause (ii) below (the "

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) no adjustment will be made for the issuance of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to all holders of Common Stock that is made in lieu of a quarterly or annual cash dividend or distribution to such holders, to the extent such dividend or distribution does not exceed the applicable Dividend Threshold Amount (with the amount of any such dividend or distribution equaling the number of such shares being issued multiplied by the average of the VWAP of the Common Stock over each of the five consecutive VWAP Trading Days prior to the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution) and (2) in the event any dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination that is the subject of this Section 14(a)(i) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the board of directors publicly announces its decision not to pay or make such dividend or distribution or effect such subdivision or combination, to the Conversion Rate that
would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared or such subdivision or combination had not been announced.
               
(ii) The issuance to all holders of Common Stock of certain rights or warrants (other than rights issued pursuant to a shareholder rights plan or rights or warrants issued in connection with a Reorganization Event) entitling them for a period expiring 60 days or less from the date of issuance of such rights or warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into Common Stock) at less than (or having a conversion price per share less than) the Current Market Price as of the Record Date, in which event each Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
     
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) in the event that such rights or warrants described in this Section 14(a)(ii) are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the board of directors publicly announces its decision not to issue such rights or warrants, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such issuance had not been declared and (2) to the extent that such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration or shares of the Common Stock are otherwise not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants upon the exercise of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.
     
In determining the aggregate price payable for such shares of the Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Corporation for such rights or warrants and the value of such consideration (if other than cash, to be determined by the board of directors). If an adjustment to the Conversion Rate may be required pursuant to this Section 14(a)(ii), delivery of any additional shares of Common Stock that may be deliverable upon conversion as a result of an adjustment required pursuant to this Section 14(a)(ii) shall be delayed to the extent necessary in order to complete the calculations provided for in this Section 14(a)(ii).
     
(iii) The dividend or other distribution to all holders of Common Stock of shares of capital stock of the Corporation (other than Common Stock) or evidences of its indebtedness or its assets (excluding any dividend, distribution or issuance covered by clauses (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above or (a)(iv) below, any dividend or distribution in connection with a Reorganization Event or any spin-off to which the provisions set forth below in this clause (a)(iii) apply) in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
     
However, if the transaction that gives rise to an adjustment pursuant to this clause (iii) is one pursuant to which the payment of a dividend or other distribution on Common Stock consists of shares of capital stock of the Corporation of, or similar equity interests in, a subsidiary or other business unit of the Corporation (
i.e.,
a spin-off) that are, or, when issued, will be, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Stock Market or any other national or regional securities exchange or market, then the Conversion Rate will instead be adjusted based on the following formula:
     
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) if any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 14(a)(iii) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the board of directors publicly announces its decision not to pay such dividend or distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If an adjustment to the Conversion Rate may be required under this Section 14(a)(iii), delivery of any additional shares of Common Stock that may be deliverable upon conversion as a result of an adjustment required under this Section 14(a)(iii) shall be delayed to the extent necessary in order to complete the calculations provided for in this Section 14(a)(iii).
               
(iv) The Corporation makes a distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all holders of Common Stock, excluding (a) any regular cash dividend on Common Stock to the extent that the aggregate cash dividend per share of Common Stock does not exceed $1.8835 in any fiscal quarter (the "
Dividend Threshold Amount
") and (b) any consideration payable in connection with a tender or exchange offer made by the Corporation or any its subsidiaries referred to in clause (v) below, in which event, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
     
The Dividend Threshold Amount is subject to adjustment on an inversely proportional basis whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted; provided that no adjustment will be made to the Dividend Threshold Amount for any adjustment made to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this clause (iv).
     
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 14(a)(iv) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the board of directors publicly announces its decision not to pay such dividend or distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
               
(v) The Corporation or one or more of its subsidiaries make purchases of Common Stock pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by the Corporation or a subsidiary of the Corporation for Common Stock to the extent that the cash and value (as determined by the board of directors) of any other consideration included in the payment per
share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged exceeds the VWAP per share of Common Stock on the VWAP Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the "
Expiration Date
"), in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
     
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Corporation, or one of its subsidiaries, is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Corporation or such subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made. If an adjustment to the Conversion Rate may be required under this Section 14(a)(v), delivery of any additional shares of Common Stock that may be deliverable upon conversion as a result of an adjustment required under this Section 14(a)(v) shall be delayed to the extent necessary in order to complete the calculations provided for in this Section 14(a)(v).
          
(b)
Calculation of Adjustments
. All adjustments to the Conversion Rate shall be calculated by the Corporation to the nearest 1/10,000th of one share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share, to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share). No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent;
provided
,
however
, that any such minor adjustment s that are not required to be made will be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and provided further that any such adjustment of less than one percent that has not been made will be made prior to any conversion pursuant to Section 13(b), Section 13(c) or Section 13(d).
          (c)
When No Adjustment Required
.
               
(i) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 14, the Conversion Rate will not be adjusted for the issuance of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or carrying the right to purchase any of the foregoing or for the repurchase of Common Stock.
               
(ii)
Rights Plans
. To the extent that the Corporation has a stockholders' rights plan in effect upon conversion of the Series L Preferred Stock into Common Stock, Holders will receive, in addition to any of Common Stock deliverable and in lieu of any adjustment to the Conversion Rate, the rights under the stockholders' rights plan, unless prior to any conversion, the rights have separated from Common Stock, in which case the Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if we distributed to all holders of Common Stock, shares of the Corporation's Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness or assets as described in Section 14(a)(iii). A further adjustment will occur as described in Se ction 14(a)(iii), if such rights become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or assets, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.
               (iii) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made:
               
(A) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on securities of the Corporation and the investment of additional optional amounts in Common Stock under any plan;
               
(B) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries; or
               
(C) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right, or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the date the Series L Preferred Stock was first issued.
               
(iv) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made for a transaction referred to in Section 14(a)(i) through (v) if Holders may participate in the transaction on a basis and with notice that the board of directors determines to be fair and appropriate in light of the basis and notice on which holders of Common Stock participate in the transaction.
               
(v) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made for a change in the par value or no par value of the Common Stock.
               
(vi) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be made to the extent that such adjustment would result in the Conversion Price being less than the par value of the Common Stock.
          
(d)
Record Date
. For purposes of this Section 14, "Record Date" means, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of the Common Stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of holders of the Common Stock entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the board of directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).
          
(e)
Successive Adjustments
. After an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 14, any subsequent event requiring an adjustment under this Section 14 shall cause an adjustment to such Conversion Rate as so adjusted.
          
(f)
Multiple Adjustments
. For the avoidance of doubt, if an event occurs that would trigger an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 14 under more than one subsection hereof, such event, to the extent fully taken into account in a single adjustment, shall not result in multiple adjustments hereunder.
          
(g)
Other Adjustments
. The Corporation may (but is not required to) make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by Section 14(a)(i) through (v), as the board of directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes.
     
In addition to the foregoing, to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange, the Corporation from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least 20 business days, the increase is irrevocable during the period and the board of directors shall have made a determination that such increase would be in the best interests of the Corporation, which determination shall be conclusive.
          
(h)
Notice of Adjustments
. Whenever a Conversion Rate is adjusted as provided under Section 14, the Corporation shall within 10 Business Days following the occurrence of an event that requires such adjustment (or if the Corporation is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming so aware) or within 15 calendar days of the date the Corporation makes an adjustment pursuant to Section 14(g):
               
(i) compute the adjusted applicable Conversion Rate in accordance with Section 14 and prepare and transmit to the Conversion Agent an Officers' Certificate setting forth the applicable Conversion Rate, as the case may be, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; and
               
(ii) provide a written notice to the Holders of the occurrence of such event and a statement in reasonable detail setting forth the method by which the adjustment to the applicable Conversion Rate was determined and setting forth the adjusted applicable Conversion Rate.
          
(i)
Conversion Agent
. The Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder to determine whether any facts exist that may require any adjustment of the applicable Conversion Rate or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making the same. The Conversion Agent shall be fully authorized and protected in relying on any Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 14(h) and any adjustment contained therein and the Conversion Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment unless and until it has received such certificate. The Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, that may at the time be issued or delivered with respect to any of the Series L Preferred Stock; and the Conversion Agent makes no representation with respect thereto. The Conversion Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Corporation to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to a the conversion of the Series L Preferred Stock or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Corporation contained in this Section 14.
     Section 15.
Reorganization Events
.
          (a) In the event of:
               
(i) any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another Person, in each case pursuant to which the Common Stock will be converted into cash, securities, or other property of the Corporation or another Person;
               
(ii) any sale, transfer, lease, or conveyance to another Person of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each case pursuant to which the Common Stock will be converted into cash, securities, or other property; or
               
(iii) any reclassification of the Common Stock into securities, including securities other than the Common Stock; or
               
(iv) any statutory exchange of the Corporation's securities with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition);
(any such event specified in this Section 15(a), a "
Reorganization Event
"); each share of Series L Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Reorganization Event shall, without the consent of Holders, become convertible into the types and amounts of securities, cash, and other property that is or was receivable in such Reorganization Event by a holder of the shares of Common Stock that was not the counterparty to the Reorganization Event or an affiliate of such other party in exchange for such Common Stock (such securities, cash, and other property, the "
Exchange Property
").
          
(b) In the event that holders of the shares of the Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, the consideration that the Holders are entitled to receive upon conversion shall be deemed to be the types and amounts of consideration received by the majority of the holders of the shares of the Common Stock that affirmatively make an election (or of all such holders if none make an
election). On each Conversion Date following a Reorganization Event, the Conversion Rate then in effect will be applied to the value on such Conversion Date of the securities, cash, or other property received per share of Common Stock, determined as set forth above. The amount of Exchange Property receivable upon conversion of any Series L Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 12, Section 13(b), Section 13(c) or Section 13(d) hereof shall be determined based upon the then Applicable Conversion Rate.
          
(c) The above provisions of this Section 15 shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events and the provisions of Section 14 shall apply to any shares of Capital Stock of the Corporation (or any successor) received by the holders of the Common Stock in any such Reorganization Event.
          
(d) The Corporation (or any successor) shall, within 20 days of the occurrence of any Reorganization Event, provide written notice to the Holders of such occurrence of such event and of the type and amount of the cash, securities or other property that constitutes the Exchange Property. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the operation of this Section 15.
     Section 16.
Fractional Shares
.
          
(a) No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued as a result of any conversion of shares of Series L Preferred Stock.
          
(b) In lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable in respect of any conversion at the Corporation's option pursuant to Section 13(b) hereof or any conversion at the option of the Holder pursuant to Section 12, Section 13(c) or Section 13(d) hereof, the Corporation shall pay an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent) equal to the same fraction of the Closing Price of the Common Stock determined as of the second Trading Day immediately preceding the effective date of conversion.
          
(c) If more than one share of the Series L Preferred Stock is surrendered for conversion at one time by or for the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of the Series L Preferred Stock so surrendered.
     Section 17.
Reservation of Common Stock
.
          
(a) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock, solely for issuance upon the conversion of shares of Series L Preferred Stock as provided in this Certificate of Designations, free from any preemptive or other similar rights, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be issuable upon the conversion of all the shares of Series L Preferred Stock then outstanding, calculated assuming the Applicable Conversion Price equals the Base Price, subject to adjustment as described under Section 14. For purposes of this Section 17(a), the number of shares of Common Stock that shall be deliverable upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series L Preferred Stock shall be computed as if at the time of computation all such outstanding shares were held by a single Holder.
          
(b) All shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Series L Preferred Stock shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, free and clear of all liens, claims, security interests and other encumbrances (other than liens, charges, security interests and other encumbrances created by the Holders).
          
(c) Prior to the delivery of any securities that the Corporation shall be obligated to deliver upon conversion of the Series L Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all federal and state laws and regulations thereunder requiring the registration of such securities with, or any approval of or consent to the delivery thereof by, any governmental authority.
          
(d) The Corporation hereby covenants and agrees that, so long as the Common Stock shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange or automated quotation system, the Corporation will, if permitted by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system, list and keep listed all the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series L Preferred Stock;
provided
,
however
, that if the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system permit the Corporation to defer the listing of such Common Stock until the first conversion of Series L Pr eferred Stock into Common Stock in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Corporation covenants to list such Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series L Preferred Stock in accordance with the requirements of such exchange or automated quotation system at such time.
     
Section 18.
Limitations on Beneficial Ownership
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, and subject to the last sentence of this Section 18, no holder of Series L Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive shares of Common Stock upon conversion pursuant to Section 12 and Section 13 hereof to the extent, but only to the extent, that such receipt would cause such converting holder to become, directly or indirectly, a "beneficial owner" (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) of more than 9.9% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding at such time. Any delivery of shares of Common Stock upon a purported conversion of Series L Preferred Stock shall be void and have no effect and such shares shall for all purposes continue to represent outstanding shares of Series L Preferred Stock to the extent (but only to the extent) that such delivery would result in the converting holder becoming the beneficial owner of more than 9.9% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding at such time. If any delivery of shares of Common Stock owed to a holder upon conversion of Series L Preferred Stock is not made, in whole or in part, as a result of this limitation, the Corporation's obligation to make such delivery shall not be extinguished and the Corporation shall deliver such shares as promptly as practicable after any such converting holder gives notice to the Corporation that such delivery would not result in it being the beneficial owner of more than 9.9% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding at such time. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary, these limitations on beneficial ownership shall not be applicable to or limit the number of shares of Series L Preferred S tock to be converted as a result of a mandatory conversion by the Corporation pursuant to Section 13(b).
     
Section 19.
Preemptive or Subscription Rights
. The Holders of Series L Preferred Stock shall not have any preemptive or subscription rights.
