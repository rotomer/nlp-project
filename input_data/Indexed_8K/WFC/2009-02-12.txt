Wells Fargo & Company announced today that, as a result of credit events occurring after its January 28, 2009 press release announcing year-end 2008 results and before the filing of its 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K, it will record other-than-temporary impairment and take a non-cash charge to earnings of $328.4 million (pre-tax) in fourth quarter 2008 for investments in certain perpetual preferred securities. Because the securities were carried at fair value at December 31, 2008, the loss on these securities was previously reported as unrealized losses on securities available for sale within cumulative other comprehensive income, a component of total stockholders' equity on the Company's balance sheet. The Company expects this charge will reduce full-year 2008 net income to $2,655 million, or $0.70 per common share, from $2,842 million, or $0.75 per share, as previously reported. For fourth quarter 2008, the Company expects the charge to increase its previously reported net loss to $(2,734) million, or $(0.84) per share, from $(2,547) million, or $(0.79) per share. The foregoing information is considered to be "filed" under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company expects to file its 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K on February 27, 2009.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
