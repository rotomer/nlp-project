TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF
AUTHENTICATION
This is one of the Securities of the
series designated therein referred to
in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture dated as of July 21, 1999, as amended by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 10, 2008 and as further amended or supplemented from time to time (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Citibank, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount to $                    ; provided, however, that the Company may, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Securities of this series, without the consent of the Holders of the Securities of this series, issue additional Securities with the same terms as the Securities of this series, and such additional Securities shall be considered part of the same series under the Indenture as the Securities of this series.
Pursuant to the Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 10, 2008, the Company and Trustee acknowledged that the Company has not opted out of the debt guarantee program (the "Debt Guarantee Program") established by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program on November 21, 2008 pursuant to the FDIC's Final Rule, 12 C.F.R. Part 370 (as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Rule"). The Trustee and its successors are designated as the duly authorized representatives (the "Representative") of the Holders of the Securities of this series for purposes of making claims and taking other permitted or required actions under the Debt Guarantee Program. Any such Holder may elect not to be represented by the Representative by providing written notice of such election to the Representative (it being understood that such election shall not affect the Trustee's capacity under the Indenture except as the representative of such Holder under the Debt Guarantee Program).
Upon an uncured failure by the Company to make a timely payment of principal or interest under the Securities of this series (a "Payment Default"), the Representative, on behalf of all Holders of the Securities of this series that are represented by the Representative, shall submit to the FDIC a demand for payment by the FDIC of such unpaid principal and interest, together with proof of such claim and such other documentation as may be required by the FDIC under the Rule (i) in the case of any Payment Default prior to the Stated Maturity Date, promptly, and in no event later than the earlier of the end of the applicable cure period and 60 days following such Payment Default and (ii) in the case of any payment due on the Stated Maturity Date, on such Stated Maturity Date.
 
The FDIC shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the Holders of the Securities of this series and the Representative with respect to the Securities of this series under the Indenture against the Company in respect of any amounts paid to the Holders of the Securities of this series, or for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities of this series, by the FDIC pursuant to the Debt Guarantee Program.
The Holders of Securities of this series, by their acceptance of the Securities of this series, authorize the Representative, at such time as the FDIC shall commence making any guarantee payments to the Representative for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities of this series pursuant to the Debt Guarantee Program (each, a "Guarantee Payment"), to execute an assignment in the form attached hereto as Annex A, pursuant to which the Representative shall assign to the FDIC its right as Representative to receive any and all payments from the Company under the Indenture on behalf of the Holders of the Securities of this series. The Company hereby consents and agrees that the FDIC is an acceptable transferee for all or any portion of the Securities of this series for all purposes of the Indenture and upon any such assignment, the FDIC shall be deemed a Holder of the Securities of this series under the Indenture for all purposes thereof, and the Company hereby agrees to take such reasonable steps as are necessary to comply with any relevant provision of the Indenture as a result of such assignment.
If a Holder of the Securities of this series has exercised its right not to be represented by the Representative, such Holder, by its acceptance of the Securities of this series, agrees that, at such time as the FDIC shall commence making any Guarantee Payments to such Holder pursuant to the Debt Guarantee Program, such Holder shall execute an assignment in the form attached hereto as Annex A, pursuant to which such Holder shall assign to the FDIC its right to receive any and all payments from the Company with respect to the Securities of this series under the Indenture.
If, at any time on or prior to the expiration of the Effective Period, payment in full hereunder shall be made pursuant to the Debt Guarantee Program on the outstanding principal and accrued interest to such date of payment, the Holder of this Security shall, or shall cause the person or entity in possession of this Security to, promptly surrender to the FDIC the security certificate, note or other instrument evidencing this Security.
The Securities of this series are not subject to redemption at the option of the Company or repayment at the option of the Holder hereof prior to June 15, 2012. The Securities of this series will not be entitled to any sinking fund.
There shall not be deemed to be an Event of Default under the Securities of this series which would permit or result in the acceleration of amounts due under the Securities of this series, if such an Event of Default is due solely to the failure of the Company to make timely payment on the Securities of this series provided that the FDIC is making timely Guarantee Payments with respect to such Securities in accordance with the Rule. Subject to the foregoing, if an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected, acting together. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding affected by certain provisions of the Indenture, acting together, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with those provisions of the Indenture. Certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences may be waived under the Indenture by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. Without the express written consent of the FDIC, the Company and the Trustee have agreed not to amend, modify, supplement or waive any provision in the Indenture that is related to the principal, interest, payment, default or ranking of the Securities of this series, that is required to be included in the Indenture pursuant to the Master Agreement or the amendment of which would require the consent of the Holders of all of the Securities of this series.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (a) the entire indebtedness on this Security and (b) certain restrictive covenants and certain Events of Default, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Security.
Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Security at the office or agency of the Company in the City of Minneapolis, Minnesota, a new Security or Securities of this series in authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange herefor, as provided in the Indenture and subject to the limitations provided therein and to the limitations described below, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
This Security is exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form only if (x) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Security or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and a successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, (y) the Company in its sole discretion determines that this Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form and notifies the Trustee thereof or (z) an Event of Default with respect to the Securities represented hereby has occurred and is continuing. If this Security is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form, bearing interest at the same rate, having the same date of issuance, redemption provisions, Stated Maturity Date and other terms and of authorized denominations aggregating a like amount.
 
This Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor of the Depositary or a nominee of such successor. Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this global Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form and will not be considered the Holders hereof for any purpose under the Indenture.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed, except as otherwise provided in this Security and except that in the event the Company deposits money or Eligible Instruments as provided in Articles 4 and 15 of the Indenture, such payments will be made only from proceeds of such money or Eligible Instruments.
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.

Exhibit 4.2
Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation ("DTC"), to the Issuer or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.
This debt is guaranteed under the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program and is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. The details of the FDIC guarantee are provided in the FDIC's regulations, 12 C.F.R. Part 370, and at the FDIC's website, www.fdic.gov/tlgp. The expiration date of the FDIC's guarantee is the earlier of the maturity date of this debt or June 30, 2012.
 
WELLS FARGO & COMPANY, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (hereinafter called the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of                     ($                    )  on June 15, 2012 (the "Stated Maturity Date") and to pay interest thereon from March 30, 2009 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date (as defined below) to which interest has been paid or duly provided for on the dates and at the rate set forth below, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest (whether or not a Business Day, as defined below) next preceding such Interest Payment Date. The Regular Record Date for an Interest Payment Date shall be the fifteenth calendar day, whether or not a Business Day, prior to such Interest Payment Date.
The interest rate per annum for this Security will be equal to LIBOR Reuters (as defined below) plus 0.22%, as determined by the calculation agent for this Security (the "Calculation Agent"), and will be reset quarterly on each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15,
commencing June 15, 2009. Each of these dates on which interest will be reset shall be referred to as an "Interest Reset Date." The initial interest rate per annum for this Security will be equal to LIBOR Reuters plus 0.22%, as determined two London Banking Days (as defined below) prior to March 30, 2009 by the Calculation Agent.
Interest on this Security will be paid on each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15, commencing June 15, 2009, and at Maturity. Each of these dates on which interest will be paid is referred to as an "Interest Payment Date." If an Interest Payment Date would fall on a day that is not a Business Day, other than the Interest Payment Date that is also the date of Maturity, such Interest Payment Date will be postponed to the following day that is a Business Day; provided, however, if such next Business Day is in a different month, then interest on this Security shall be paid on the Business Day immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date. If the date of Maturity would fall on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal and any premium and interest shall be made on the next Business Day, with the same force and effect as if made on the due date, and no additional interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such date of Maturity. "Business Day" as used herein means a day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law or regulation to close in New York, New York or Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Except as described below for the first Interest Period, on each Interest Payment Date, the Company will pay interest for the period commencing on and including the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date and ending on and including the next day preceding that Interest Payment Date. This period is referred to as an "Interest Period." The first Interest Period will begin on and include March 30, 2009 and, subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, will end on and include June 14, 2009. The amount of interest to be paid on this Security for each Interest Period will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of this Security by an accrued interest factor. The "accrued interest factor" will be computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day in the Interest Period. The "interest factor" for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to that day by 360.
"LIBOR Reuters," for any Interest Determination Date (as defined below) shall be the arithmetic mean of the offered rates for deposits in United States dollars having a three-month maturity, commencing on the second London Banking Day immediately following that Interest Determination Date, that appear on Reuters Page LIBOR01 (as defined below) as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Interest Determination Date if at least two offered rates appear on Reuters Page LIBOR01; provided that if Reuters Page LIBOR01 by its terms provides only for a single rate, that single rate will be used to determine LIBOR Reuters. If fewer than two offered rates appear, or no rate appears and Reuters Page LIBOR01 by its terms provides only for a single rate, then the Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of each of four major banks in the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in United States dollars for a three-month period commencing on the second London Banking Day immediately following the Interest Determination Date to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Interest Determination Date in a Representative Amount (as defined below). If at least two
 
quotations are provided, LIBOR Reuters determined on that Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR Reuters will be determined for the applicable Interest Reset Date as the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, by three major banks in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks, having a three-month maturity and in a Representative Amount. If the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth above, LIBOR Reuters for that Interest Determination Date will remain LIBOR Reuters for the immediately preceding Interest Period, or, if none, the rate of interest payable will be the initial interest rate.
"Interest Determination Date" means, for any Interest Reset Date, the second London Banking Day prior to that Interest Reset Date.
"London Banking Day" means any day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
"Representative Amount" means a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in U.S. dollars in the relevant market at the relevant time.
"Reuters Page LIBOR01" means the display designated as "Page LIBOR01" on Reuters Money 3000 Service or any successor service (or such other page as may replace Page LIBOR01 on that service or a successor service).
All percentages used in or resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with .000005% rounded up to .00001%, and all U.S. dollar amounts used in or resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest cent, with one-half cent rounded upward.
The interest rate on the Securities of this series will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.
The Calculation Agent shall, upon the request of a Holder of this Security, provide the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate that will become effective on the next Interest Reset Date. All calculations of the Calculation Agent, in the absence of manifest error, shall be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the Holder hereof. The Calculation Agent shall notify the Paying Agent of each determination of the interest applicable to this Security promptly after the determination is made. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. will initially act as Calculation Agent. The Company may appoint a successor Calculation Agent with the written consent of the Paying Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Any interest not punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special
 
Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF
AUTHENTICATION
This is one of the Securities of the
series designated therein referred to
in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture dated as of July 21, 1999, as amended by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 10, 2008 and as further amended or supplemented from time to time (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Citibank, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount to $                    ; provided, however, that the Company may, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Securities of this series, without the consent of the Holders of the Securities of this series, issue additional Securities with the same terms as the Securities of this series, and such additional Securities shall be considered part of the same series under the Indenture as the Securities of this series.
Pursuant to the Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 10, 2008, the Company and Trustee acknowledged that the Company has not opted out of the debt guarantee program (the "Debt Guarantee Program") established by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program on November 21, 2008 pursuant to the FDIC's Final Rule, 12 C.F.R. Part 370 (as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Rule"). The Trustee and its successors are designated as the duly authorized representatives (the "Representative") of the Holders of the Securities of this series for purposes of making claims and taking other permitted or required actions under the Debt Guarantee Program. Any such Holder may elect not to be represented by the Representative by providing written notice of such election to the Representative (it being understood that such election shall not affect the Trustee's capacity under the Indenture except as the representative of such Holder under the Debt Guarantee Program).
Upon an uncured failure by the Company to make a timely payment of principal or interest under the Securities of this series (a "Payment Default"), the Representative, on behalf of all Holders of the Securities of this series that are represented by the Representative, shall submit to the FDIC a demand for payment by the FDIC of such unpaid principal and interest, together with proof of such claim and such other documentation as may be required by the FDIC under the Rule (i) in the case of any Payment Default prior to the Stated Maturity Date, promptly, and
 
in no event later than the earlier of the end of the applicable cure period and 60 days following such Payment Default and (ii) in the case of any payment due on the Stated Maturity Date, on such Stated Maturity Date.
The FDIC shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the Holders of the Securities of this series and the Representative with respect to the Securities of this series under the Indenture against the Company in respect of any amounts paid to the Holders of the Securities of this series, or for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities of this series, by the FDIC pursuant to the Debt Guarantee Program.
The Holders of Securities of this series, by their acceptance of the Securities of this series, authorize the Representative, at such time as the FDIC shall commence making any guarantee payments to the Representative for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities of this series pursuant to the Debt Guarantee Program (each, a "Guarantee Payment"), to execute an assignment in the form attached hereto as Annex A, pursuant to which the Representative shall assign to the FDIC its right as Representative to receive any and all payments from the Company under the Indenture on behalf of the Holders of the Securities of this series. The Company hereby consents and agrees that the FDIC is an acceptable transferee for all or any portion of the Securities of this series for all purposes of the Indenture and upon any such assignment, the FDIC shall be deemed a Holder of the Securities of this series under the Indenture for all purposes thereof, and the Company hereby agrees to take such reasonable steps as are necessary to comply with any relevant provision of the Indenture as a result of such assignment.
If a Holder of the Securities of this series has exercised its right not to be represented by the Representative, such Holder, by its acceptance of the Securities of this series, agrees that, at such time as the FDIC shall commence making any Guarantee Payments to such Holder pursuant to the Debt Guarantee Program, such Holder shall execute an assignment in the form attached hereto as Annex A, pursuant to which such Holder shall assign to the FDIC its right to receive any and all payments from the Company with respect to the Securities of this series under the Indenture.
If, at any time on or prior to the expiration of the Effective Period, payment in full hereunder shall be made pursuant to the Debt Guarantee Program on the outstanding principal and accrued interest to such date of payment, the Holder of this Security shall, or shall cause the person or entity in possession of this Security to, promptly surrender to the FDIC the security certificate, note or other instrument evidencing this Security.
The Securities of this series are not subject to redemption at the option of the Company or repayment at the option of the Holder hereof prior to June 15, 2012. The Securities of this series will not be entitled to any sinking fund.
There shall not be deemed to be an Event of Default under the Securities of this series which would permit or result in the acceleration of amounts due under the Securities of this series, if such an Event of Default is due solely to the failure of the Company to make timely payment on the Securities of this series provided that the FDIC is making timely Guarantee Payments with respect to such Securities in accordance with the Rule. Subject to the foregoing,
 
if an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected, acting together. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding affected by certain provisions of the Indenture, acting together, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with those provisions of the Indenture. Certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences may be waived under the Indenture by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. Without the express written consent of the FDIC, the Company and the Trustee have agreed not to amend, modify, supplement or waive any provision in the Indenture that is related to the principal, interest, payment, default or ranking of the Securities of this series, that is required to be included in the Indenture pursuant to the Master Agreement or the amendment of which would require the consent of the Holders of all of the Securities of this series.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (a) the entire indebtedness on this Security and (b) certain restrictive covenants and certain Events of Default, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Security.
Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Security at the office or agency of the Company in the City of Minneapolis, Minnesota, a new Security or Securities of this series in authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange herefor, as provided in the Indenture and subject to the limitations provided therein and to the limitations described below, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
This Security is exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form only if (x) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Security or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and a successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, (y) the Company in its sole discretion determines that this Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form and notifies the Trustee thereof or (z) an Event of Default with respect to the Securities represented hereby has occurred and is continuing. If this Security is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form, bearing interest at the same rate, having the same date of issuance, redemption provisions, Stated Maturity Date and other terms and of authorized denominations aggregating a like amount.
 
This Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor of the Depositary or a nominee of such successor. Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this global Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form and will not be considered the Holders hereof for any purpose under the Indenture.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed, except as otherwise provided in this Security and except that in the event the Company deposits money or Eligible Instruments as provided in Articles 4 and 15 of the Indenture, such payments will be made only from proceeds of such money or Eligible Instruments.
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.

Exhibit 5.1
Wells Fargo & Company
420 Montgomery Street
San Francisco, California 94163
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Senior Company Counsel of Wells Fargo & Company (the "Company") and, as such, I, together with other attorneys in the Wells Fargo Law Department, have acted as counsel for the Company in connection with the preparation of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement") of the Company and Wells Fargo Capital X, Wells Fargo Capital XI, Wells Fargo Capital XII, Wells Fargo Capital XIII, Wells Fargo Capital XIV, Wells Fargo Capital XV, Wells Fargo Capital XVI, Wells Fargo Capital XVII, Wells Fargo Capital XVIII, Wells Fargo Capital XIX and Wells Fargo Capital XX filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to the proposed offer and sale from time to time of the securities referred to therein, and a Prospectus Supplement dated March 25, 2009 to the Prospectus dated June 19, 2006 (together, the "Prospectus") relating to the offer and sale by the Company under the Registration Statement of $1,750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes Due June 15, 2012 (the "Floating Rate Notes") and $1,750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.125% Notes Due June 15, 2012 (the "Fixed Rate Notes" and, together with the Floating Rate Notes, the "Notes"). The Notes are to be guaranteed under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program and issued under the Indenture dated as of July 21, 1999 (the "Indenture"), as supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 10, 2008, entered into by the Company and Citibank, N.A., as trustee, and sold pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement dated March 25, 2009 between the Company and the Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriting Agreement").
I, or attorneys in the Wells Fargo Law Department under my direction, have examined such documents, records, and instruments as I have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
Based on the foregoing, I am of the opinion that the Notes have been duly authorized and, when duly executed by the Company, authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Notes will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms subject, as to their legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,

moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and subject to general equity principles (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and except further as enforcement thereof may be limited by any governmental authority that limits, delays or prohibits the making of payments outside the United States.
I have relied as to certain relevant facts upon certificates of, and/or information provided by officers and employees of the Company as to the accuracy of such factual matters without independent verification thereof or other investigation. I have also relied, without investigation, upon the following assumptions: (i) natural persons acting on behalf of the Company have sufficient legal capacity to enter into and perform, on behalf of the Company, the transaction in question; (ii) each party to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreements or instruments enforceable against it; (iii) each party to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company has complied with all legal requirements pertaining to its status as such status relates to its rights to enforce such agreements or instruments against the Company; (iv) each document submitted to me for review is accurate and complete, each such document that is an original is authentic, each such document that is a copy conforms to an authentic original, and all signatures on each such document are genuine; (v) there has not been any mutual mistake of fact or misunderstanding, fraud, duress or undue influence; and (vi) all statutes, judicial and administrative decisions, and rules and regulations of governmental agencies, constituting the law of the opining jurisdictions, are publicly available to lawyers practicing in Minnesota.
Without limiting any other qualifications set forth herein, the opinions expressed herein regarding the enforceability of the Notes are subject to the effect of generally applicable laws that (i) provide for the enforcement of oral waivers or modifications where a material change of position in reliance thereon has occurred or provide that a course of performance may operate as a waiver, (ii) limit the availability of a remedy under certain circumstances where another remedy has been elected, (iii) may, where less than all of a contract may be unenforceable, limit the enforceability of the balance of the contract to circumstances in which the unenforceable portion is not an essential part of the agreed exchange, (iv) govern and afford judicial discretion regarding the determination of damages and entitlement to attorneys' fees and other costs, (v) may permit a party who has materially failed to render or offer performance required by a contract to cure that failure unless either permitting a cure would unreasonably hinder the aggrieved party from making substitute arrangements for performance or it is important under the circumstances to the aggrieved party that performance occur by the date stated in the contract, (vi) may require mitigation of damages, and (vii) may limit the enforceability of provisions imposing increased interest rates or late payment charges upon delinquency in payment or default or providing for liquidated damages or for premiums upon acceleration.
I express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of Minnesota, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and the federal laws of the United States of America. I express no opinion as to whether, or the extent to which, the laws of any particular jurisdiction apply to the subject matter hereof, including, without limitation, the

enforceability of the governing law provision contained in the Notes. Because the governing law provision of the Notes relates to the law of a jurisdiction as to which I express no opinion, the opinion regarding enforceability of the Notes set forth herein is given as if the law of the State of Minnesota governs the Notes.
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company filed with the Commission and thereby incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement. In giving such consent, I do not thereby admit that I am in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act.
