At the Company's annual meeting of stockholders held on April 28, 2009, stockholders approved an amendment to Section 4.1 of the Company's Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (LTICP), which plan permits a committee of the Company's Board of Directors to grant awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciate rights (SARs), restricted stock, restricted share rights, performance shares, performance units or stock awards to eligible directors and team members, to (i) authorize an additional 150 million shares of the Company's common stock to be available for awards under the LTICP, and (ii) count each share issued under awards other than options or SARs against the number of shares available for awards under the LTICP as two shares instead of three and one-half shares. The foregoing description of the amendment to the LTICP is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the LTICP, as amended on April 28, 2009, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10(a) to this report and incorporated herein by reference.
The Company's named executive officers participate in the Company's non-qualified Supplemental Cash Balance Plan and Supplemental 401(k) Plan (collectively, the "Supplemental Plans"), which restore certain retirement benefits lost due to (i) various limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on contributions and/or eligible compensation in the Company's qualified retirement plans, and (ii) deferrals of compensation under the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan. On April 28, 2009, the Company's Board approved amendments to freeze the Supplemental Plans effective as of July 1, 2009. As a result of the amendments, there will be no new participants in the Supplemental Plans and no additional benefits will accrue to participants after June 30, 2009, except to the extent additional benefit accruals may be necessary in 2009 to account for 2009 compensation deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan and/or the impact of any IRS-imposed limitations related to the Company's qualified Cash Balance Plan. The foregoing description of the Supplemental Plans is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Supplemental Plans, copies of which are filed as Exhibits 10(b) and (c), respectively, to this report and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Company held its annual meeting of stockholders on April 28, 2009. At the meeting, stockholders elected all 19 of the directors nominated by the Board of Directors and ratified the appointment of KPMG LLP as independent auditors for 2009. Each director received a greater number of votes cast "for" his or her election than votes cast "against" his or her election. Stockholders approved the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in the Company's 2009 proxy statement and the amendment to the LTICP, and did not approve the two stockholder proposals presented at the meeting, as follows:
Proposal to Approve a Non-Binding Advisory Resolution Regarding the Compensation of the Company's Named Executives
 
Proposal to Approve an Amendment to the Company's Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan
 
Stockholder Proposal Regarding a By-Laws Amendment to Require an Independent Chairman
 
Stockholder Proposal Regarding a Report on Political Contributions
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 10(a)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"This certificate and the shares of stock represented hereby are subject to the terms and conditions (including forfeiture provisions and restrictions against transfer) contained in the Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan and the Restricted Stock Award. Release from such terms and conditions shall be obtained only in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and the Award, a copy of each of which is on file in the office of the Secretary of Wells Fargo & Company."
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If a Director subsequently becomes an Employee, the service requirement of the Award can be satisfied by such subsequent employment and the Award shall not terminate solely because of the change in status.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If a person in the class surviving dies before receiving any payment and/or exercising any rights with respect to outstanding Awards (or the person's share of any payment and/or rights in case of more than one person in the class), that person's right to receive any payment and/or exercise any rights with respect to outstanding Awards will lapse and the determination of who will be entitled to receive any payment and/or exercise any rights with respect to outstanding Awards will be determined as if that person predeceased the Participant.
For all purposes under this Plan, the following terms have the meanings assigned to them below:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For avoidance of doubt, this Section 15 shall not apply to the sale or other disposition by the Company of the assets of, or stock or other ownership interests in, an Affiliate unless such disposition would constitute a disposition of substantially all of the assets of the Company.
The Committee shall take such action as in its discretion may be necessary or advisable to carry out the provisions of this Section.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 15 to the contrary, payment of the portion of any Award that is subject to Code 409A shall not be accelerated pursuant to this Section 15 unless the event also qualifies as a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company, within the meaning of Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3(i)(5) (a "qualifying event"). In the event payment of Shares attributable to Restricted Share Rights is accelerated pursuant to this Section 15, such payment shall be made 30 days after the qualifying event.
 
 
 
 
 
The Committee shall take such action as in its discretion may be necessary or advisable to carry out the provisions of this Section.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 16 to the contrary:
(A) This Section 16 shall not apply to a Participant's Restricted Share Rights granted before January 1, 2007 if such Participant ceases to be an Employee due to Retirement.
(B) Payment of the portion of any Restricted Share Right, Performance Share or Performance Unit Award that is subject to Code 409A shall not be accelerated pursuant to this Section 16 unless the changes in the Board also qualify as a change in the effective control of the Company within the meaning of Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3(i)(5)(vi).
(C) Except as provided in (D) below, Shares attributable to Restricted Share Rights that are payable to a Participant pursuant to this Section 16 shall be paid 30 days after the Participant's termination of employment.
(D) Notwithstanding (C) above, the portion of any Restricted Share Right, Performance Share or Performance Unit Award that is subject to Code 409A and becomes payable to an Employee pursuant to this Section 16 shall be paid six months after the date of such termination of employment if the Employee is a Specified Employee.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Without amending the Plan, the Committee may grant Awards to Employees and Directors who are foreign nationals on such terms and conditions different from those specified in this Plan as may, in the judgment of the Committee, be necessary or desirable to foster and promote achievement of the purposes of this Plan and shall have the authority to adopt such modifications, procedures, subplans and the like as may be necessary or desirable to comply with provisions of the laws or regulations of other countries or jurisdictions in which the Company or any Affiliate may operate or have Employees to ensure the viability of the benefits from Awards granted to Participants employed in such countries or jurisdictions, meet the requirements that permit this Plan to operate in a qualified or tax-efficient manner, comply with applicable foreign laws or regulations and meet the objectives of this Plan.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No termination, suspension, or modification of the Plan will adversely affect any right acquired by any Participant or any Beneficiary under an Award granted before the date of termination, suspension, or modification, unless otherwise agreed to by the Participant; but it will be conclusively presumed that any adjustment for changes in capitalization provided for in Section 26 does not adversely affect any right.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following terms and conditions shall apply to the deferred delivery of Shares attributable to Restricted Share Rights granted prior to January 1, 2008, to the extent such Restricted Share Rights were not earned and vested prior to January 1, 2005.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
then the deferred Shares shall be paid six months after the date of the Participant's "separation from service".

The Company is not required to establish or maintain any fund, trust or account (other than a bookkeeping account or reserve) for the purpose of funding or paying the benefits promised under this Plan. If such a fund is established, the property therein shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the Company. The Company will pay the cost of this Plan out of its general assets. All references to accounts, income, expenses, payments and the like are included merely for the purpose of measuring the Company's obligation to participants in this Plan and shall not be construed to impose on the Company the obligation to create any separate fund for purposes of this Plan.
Sec. 15 .

Any attempt to do so by the participant, a spouse, Beneficiary or joint annuitant, a court, or any other person or entity shall result in forfeiture of the benefits otherwise payable under this Plan with respect to said participant. The Plan Administrator shall not recognize any attachment, garnishment, execution of judgment or other legal process affecting the participant's benefits under this Plan. The designation of a Beneficiary by a participant does not constitute a transfer.

Such participation shall in no way interfere with any rights of a Participating Employer to determine the duration of a participant's employment or the terms and conditions of such employment.

No Guarantee of Employment
The benefit payable under the Plan to any participant, spouse, Beneficiary or joint annuitant shall be subject to the deduction of any federal, state or local income taxes, Social Security (FICA) taxes, Medicare tax or other taxes which are required to be withheld from such payments by applicable laws or regulations. Any Social Security or Medicare tax which is required to be withheld based on credits to a participant's Plan account for a year may be withheld from other compensation payable to the participant by the Participating Employers for that year, or if no such withholding is possible, may be deducted from the amounts credited to the participant's Plan account.

The Company shall establish a claims procedure consistent with the requirements of ERISA. Such claims procedure shall provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or Beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the Plan has been denied, setting forth the specific reasons for such denial, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall afford a reasonable opportunity to a claimant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the Company of the decision denying the claim. If no such claims procedure has been established for this Plan, any claim shall be processed according to the claims procedure in effect under the Pension Plan.
Sec. 20 .
Claims Procedure

The Plan shall be construed and administered according to the laws of State of Minnesota to the extent that such laws are not preempted by ERISA.

All participants' Plan Accounts are allocated solely to the Wells Fargo & Company Stock Investment Fund, and no other Investment Funds are available.
Sec. 9 .
Investment of Credits
Credits to a participant's Plan Account shall be subject to the following:
Sec. 10 .
Adjustment and Funding of Accounts

A participant may not request or receive any loans or withdrawals from his or her Plan Account. The credits in a participant's Plan Account will be paid out only as described in Sections 16, 17 and 18.
Sec. 14 .
Loans and Withdrawals
Upon a Separation from Service, a participant shall be entitled to a benefit equal to the number of shares of Company common stock credited to the participant's Plan Account, calculated as of the end of the calendar year immediately prior to the date benefits are distributed pursuant to Sections 16 or 17 (except as provided in subsection (c) of this Section 15), multiplied by the vested percentage determined under either Sec. 9.1, Sec. 9.2 or Sec. 9.3 of the 401(k) Plan that would be applicable to the participant at the time the Separation from Service occurs, disregarding, however, Sec. 9.2(a)(3) and (4) of the 401(k) Plan.

Payment to the Beneficiary will be in the form of whole shares of Company common stock with cash for any fractional share, net of any required withholding taxes.
Sec. 17 .
Death Benefits
If the Company shall merge or consolidate with another corporation and the Company is not the surviving corporation (a "Transaction"), and the consideration received by the holders of common stock of the Company in the Transaction consists only of common stock of another publicly owned corporation whose outstanding stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange or quoted in the NASDAQ National Market System ("Publicly-Traded Stock"), each share of Company common stock credited to a participant's Plan Account shall be converted to a credit for the number of shares of Publicly-Traded Stock which the holder of a share of Company common stock is entitled to receive in such Transaction and, beginning on and after the effective date of the Transaction, any future credits to Plan Accounts or payment of vested benefits payable in the form of shares of common stock shall be made in the form of shares of such Publicly-Traded Stock.

Adjustments Upon the Occurrence of Certain Business Transactions
If the consideration received by the holders of common stock of the Company in a Transaction consists of any consideration other than Publicly-Traded Stock, each share of Company common stock credited to a participant's Plan Account shall be restated as credits for cash in an amount equal to the number of shares of Company common stock credited to a participant's Plan Account immediately prior to the effective date of the Transaction multiplied by the average of the high and low prices of a share of Company common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for each of the five trading days preceding the effective date of the Transaction. Such cash shall automatically be deemed to be invested in one or more investment accounts that conform to the investment fund options then provided by the 401(k) Plan, upon such terms and conditions as may be established by the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors.
 
A participant's Plan Account and the shares of Company common stock credited to a participant's Plan Account are not assignable or transferable by a participant or Beneficiary nor shall any participant or Beneficiary have the power to anticipate, alienate, dispose of, pledge or encumber his or her Plan Account while the Plan Account is in the possession and control of the Company. The Plan Administrator shall not recognize any attachment, garnishment, execution of judgment or other legal process while the participant's Plan Account is in the possession and control of the Company. The designation of a Beneficiary by a participant does not constitute a transfer.
Sec. 19 .
Nonassignability
The obligations of the Company to make payments under this Plan constitute only the unsecured (but legally enforceable) promise of the Company to make such payments. The participant shall have no lien, prior claim or other security interest in any property of the Company. The Company is not required to establish or maintain any fund, trust or account (other than a bookkeeping account or reserve) for the purpose of funding or paying the benefits promised under this Plan. If such a fund is established, the property therein shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the Company. The Company will pay the cost of this Plan out of its general assets. All references to Account, Accounts, gains, losses, income, expenses, payments and the like are included merely for the purpose of measuring the Company's obligation to participants in this Plan and shall not be construed to impose on the Company the obligation to create any separate fund for purposes of this Plan.
Sec. 20 .
Unsecured Obligation
If the Company chooses to fund credits to participants' Plan Accounts, all cash contributed for such funding shall be held and administered in trust in accordance with the terms and provisions of a trust agreement between the Company and the appointed trustee or any duly appointed successor trustee. All Company common stock or other funds in the trust shall be held on a commingled basis and shall be subject to the claims of general creditors of the Company. Plan Accounts shall be for bookkeeping purposes only, and the establishment of Plan Accounts shall not require segregation of trust assets.
Sec. 21 .
Trust Fund
Participation in this Plan does not constitute a guarantee or contract of employment with any Participating Employer. Such participation shall in no way interfere with any rights of a Participating Employer to determine the duration of a participant's employment or the terms and conditions of such employment.
Sec. 22 .
No Guarantee of Employment
The benefits payable under this Plan shall be subject to the deduction of the amount of any federal, state or local income taxes, Social Security tax, Medicare tax or other taxes required to be withheld from such payments by applicable laws and regulations. Any Social Security or Medicare tax which is required to be withheld based on credits to a participant's Plan Account for a year may be withheld from other compensation payable to the participant by the Participating Employers for that year, or if no such withholding is possible, may be deducted from the amounts credited to the participant's Plan Account.
Sec. 23 .
Withholding of Taxes
For purposes of Section 3(16)(A) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), as amended, the Plan Administrator shall be the Company's Executive Vice President of Human Resources. The Plan Administrator or its delegatee shall have the exclusive authority and responsibility for all matters in connection with the operation and administration of the Plan. The Plan Administrator's powers and duties shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following: (a) responsibility for the compilation and maintenance of all records necessary in connection with the Plan; (b) authorizing the payment of all benefits and expenses of the Plan as they become payable under the Plan; (c) authority to engage such legal, accounting and other professional services as it

Administration
 
may deem necessary; (d) discretionary authority to interpret the terms of the Plan; (e) authority to adopt procedures for implementing the Plan, including policies for determining when a participant has a Separation from Service and for determining whether a participant is a Specified Employee; and (f) discretionary authority to determine participants' eligibility for benefits under the Plan or the amount of such benefits; and to resolve all issues of fact and law in connection with such determinations.
The Company shall establish a claims procedure consistent with the requirements of ERISA. Such claims procedure shall provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or Beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the Plan has been denied, setting forth the specific reasons for such denial, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall afford a reasonable opportunity to a claimant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the Company of the decision denying the claim. If no such claims procedure has been established for this Plan, any claim shall be processed according to the claims procedure in effect under the 401(k) Plan.
Sec. 25 .
Claims Procedure
This Plan is intended to be construed and administered as an unfunded plan maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees as provided in sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA. The Plan shall be construed and administered according to the laws of the State of Minnesota to the extent that such laws are not preempted by ERISA.
Sec. 26 .
Construction and Applicable Law
The Plan Administrator shall be the agent for service of legal process with respect to any matter concerning the Plan, unless and until the Company designates some other person as such agent.
Sec. 27 .
Agent for Legal Process
The Board of Directors of the Company or the Human Resources Committee of the Company's Board of Directors may at any time terminate, suspend or amend this Plan in any manner; provided, that to the extent required by applicable law, rule or regulation, the stockholders of the Company must approve any amendment to (i) increase the number of shares of common stock to be credited under this Plan (except for adjustments by reason of stock dividends, stock splits, subdivision, consolidations, combinations, reclassifications or recapitalizations), or (ii) make other material revisions to this Plan. No such action shall deprive any participant of any benefits to which he or she would have been entitled under the Plan if the participant's Separation from Service had occurred on the day prior to the date such action was taken, unless agreed to by the participant. Upon any termination of this Plan, all credits to Plan Accounts under Sections 7 and 8 shall cease but the Plan shall continue in effect for the purpose of distributing benefits that had accrued prior to the termination pursuant to the provisions hereof as if the termination had not occurred, unless the Company takes action in accordance with Code section 409A and the regulations thereunder to cause an earlier distribution of Plan benefits.
Sec. 28 .
Amendment and Termination
Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, in the event the maximum number of shares that can be credited to Plan Accounts under Section 12 is reached and, if required by applicable law, rule or regulation, the stockholders of the Company have not approved an amendment of this Plan increasing said maximum, all further credits under this Plan shall cease until such time as the stockholders of the Company give said required approval of such an amendment increasing the maximum allocation, unless otherwise determined by the Company's Board of Directors.
To the extent any provision of this Plan does not satisfy the requirements of Code section 409A or any regulations or other guidance issued by the Treasury Department or the Internal Revenue Service under Code section 409A, such provision will be applied in a manner consistent with such requirements,
Sec. 29 .
Savings Clause Relating to Compliance with Code Section 409A
 
regulations or guidance, notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, and to the extent not prohibited by Code section 409A, the provisions of the Plan and the rights of participants and Beneficiaries hereunder shall be deemed to have been modified accordingly.
The effective date of this restated Plan is January 1, 2008. The Plan's original effective date was July 1, 1988. The Plan was previously restated in its entirety effective January 1, 2004.
