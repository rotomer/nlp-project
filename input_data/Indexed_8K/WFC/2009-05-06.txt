(c) The Company may remove a Remarketing Agent by giving not less than 10 days' prior written notice to the Remarketing Agents such removal to be effective upon the expiration of such notice period and the Company's appointment of a successor Remarketing Agent. In such case, the Company will use its best efforts to appoint a successor Remarketing Agent and amend this Agreement accordingly or enter into a remarketing agreement with such person as soon as reasonably practicable.

Section 7. . (a) Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, when acting as the Remarketing Agents or in their individual or any other capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold and deal in any of the Debentures. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, as Holders or Beneficial Owners of the Debentures, may exercise any vote or join as a Holder or Beneficial Owner, as the case may be, in any action which any Holder or Beneficial Owner of Debentures may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Indenture with like effect as if they did not act in any capacity hereunder. The Remarketing Agents, in their capacity either as principal or agent, may also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Company as freely as if they did not act in any capacity hereunder.
Dealing in the Debentures; Purchase of Debentures by the Company
(b) The Company may purchase Debentures in the remarketing, provided that, in the event that any Beneficial Owners of Debentures have elected not to participate in the remarketing by delivering and not timely withdrawing a Hold Notice, the Reset Yield established with respect to Debentures in the remarketing is not different from the Reset Yield that would have been established if the Company had not purchased such Debentures.
Section 8. . The obligations of the Remarketing Agents under this Agreement have been undertaken in reliance on, and shall be subject to:
Conditions to Remarketing Agents' Obligations
(a) the due performance by the Company of its obligations and agreements as set forth in this Agreement and the accuracy of the representations and warranties in this Agreement and any certificate delivered pursuant hereto; and
(b) the further condition that none of the following events shall have occurred at any time during which the Remarketing Agents would otherwise be obligated to take any action under this Agreement, as determined by the Remarketing Agents in their sole judgment:
(i) (A) there shall have occurred any downgrading, or any notice shall have been given of any intended or potential downgrading or of any review for a possible change that does not indicate the direction of the possible change, in the rating accorded the Company or any of the Company's securities or in the rating outlook for the Company by any Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization or (B) the rating assigned to the Debentures shall be lower than Aa3 (or the equivalent) or withdrawn by any Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization;
 
(ii) without the prior written consent of the Remarketing Agents, (A) the Indenture (including the Debentures) shall have been amended in any manner, or otherwise contain any provision not contained therein as of the date hereof, that in either case was not approved by the Remarketing Agents and in the judgment of the Remarketing Agents materially change the nature of the Debentures or the remarketing procedures or (B) any person shall succeed to, or the Company shall otherwise assign, transfer or convey, the obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Debentures (it being understood that, notwithstanding the provisions of this clause (ii), the Company shall not be prohibited from amending the Indenture);

(iv) there shall have occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or the international financial markets, any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis or any change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Remarketing Agents, impracticable to remarket the Debentures or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Debentures;
(v) an Event of Default, or any event which, with the giving of notice or passage of time, or both, would constitute an Event of Default, with respect to the Debentures shall have occurred and be continuing;
(vi) a material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, shall have occurred; or
(vii) the Company shall fail to furnish to the Remarketing Agents on the Closing Date (or other date specified in Annex I) the officers' certificate, opinions and comfort letter(s), in each case as referred to in Section 3(b) of this Agreement, and such other documents and opinions as counsel for the Remarketing Agents may reasonably require for the purpose of enabling such counsel to pass upon the sale of Debentures in the remarketing as herein contemplated and related proceedings, or in order to evidence
 
the accuracy and completeness of any of the representations and warranties, or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained, or the Remarketing Agents shall not have received on the Closing Date a favorable opinion (including a statement as to the absence of material misstatements in or omissions from the then-current Remarketing Materials relating to the remarketing of the Debentures) of counsel for the Remarketing Agents;
and the Remarketing Agents shall have received on the Reset Yield Determination Date such a certificate of the Company, signed by any Senior Vice President or Executive Vice President and the principal financial officer or accounting officer of the Company, dated as of such date, to the effect that (i) the representations and warranties in this Agreement are true and correct with the same force and effect as though expressly made at and as of such date, (ii) the Company has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to such date and (iii) none of the events specified in this clause (b) has occurred; and
(c) In the event of the failure of any of the foregoing conditions, the Remarketing Agents may terminate their obligations under this Agreement as provided in Section 11.
Section 9. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Remarketing Agents and their affiliates, officers, directors and employees and each person, if any, who controls each of the Remarketing Agents within the meaning of Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows:
Indemnification
(i) against any loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of, (A) the failure to have an effective Registration Statement under the 1933 Act relating to the Debentures or the failure to satisfy the prospectus delivery requirements of the 1933 Act because the Company failed to provide the Remarketing Agents with the Prospectus or Final Term Sheet for delivery, or the failure by the Company to timely pay any required Commission filing fees relating to the remarketing of the Debentures or to make any related required filing with the Commission, or (B) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any of the Remarketing Materials (including any incorporated documents), or (C) the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, or (D) any violation by the Company of, or any failure by the Company to perform any of its obligations under, this Agreement, or (E) the acts or omissions of the Remarketing Agents in connection with their duties and obligations to determine the Reset Yield hereunder except that are finally judicially determined to be due to their gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith;
(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever arising out of, or based upon, any of items (A) through (E) in clause (i) above; provided that such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
 
(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Remarketing Agents), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever arising out of, or based upon, any of items (A) through (E) in clause (i) above to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
, , that the foregoing indemnity shall not apply to any losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Remarketing Agents expressly for use in the Remarketing Materials.
provided
however
(b) The Remarketing Agents, severally and not jointly, agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and any of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, from and against any loss, liability, claim, damage and expense, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions made in the Remarketing Materials in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company in writing by the Remarketing Agents expressly for use in such Remarketing Materials. The indemnity agreement in this paragraph shall extend upon the same terms and conditions to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 20 of the 1934 Act.
(c) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to clause (a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Remarketing Agents and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to clause (b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it shall wish, jointly, with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party). In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to obtain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts of interests between them. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its
 
prior written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reasons of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 9 or Section 10 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) The indemnity agreements contained in this Section 9 shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agents, and shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement and the remarketing of any Debentures hereunder.
Section 10. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 9 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Remarketing Agent on the other hand from the remarketing of the Debentures pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of each Remarketing Agent on the other hand in connection with the acts, failures to act, statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Remarketing Agent on the other hand in connection with the remarketing of the Debentures pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as (i) the aggregate accreted principal amount of the Debentures, and (ii) the fee received by such Remarketing Agent in connection with the remarketing of the Debentures in connection with the Remarketing Reset Date.
The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and each Remarketing Agent on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the responsibility hereunder of the applicable party for any act or failure to act relating to the losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses incurred or, in the case of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses arising out of any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any of the Remarketing Materials or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact therefrom, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Remarketing Agents and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and the Remarketing Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 10. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 10 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such act or failure to act or untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10, no Remarketing Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Debentures remarketed by it and resold to the public were sold to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Remarketing Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any act or failure to act for which it is responsible hereunder or any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 10, each person, if any, who controls a Remarketing Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Remarketing Agent, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
Section 11. . (a) This Agreement shall terminate as to a Remarketing Agent on the effective date of the resignation or removal of such Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 6 hereof.
Termination of Remarketing Agreement
(b) In addition, a Remarketing Agent may terminate all of its obligations under this Agreement immediately by notifying the Company and the other Remarketing Agent of its election to do so, at any time on or before the Closing Date, in the event that: (i) any of the conditions referred to or set forth in Section 8(a) hereof have not been met or satisfied in full, or the Company shall have failed to comply with the certification requirements of Section 8(b); (ii) any of the events set forth in Section 8(b) hereof shall have occurred or be continuing; or (iii) a Remarketing Agent determines, in its sole discretion, after consultation with the Company and the other Remarketing Agent, that it shall not have received all of the information, whether or not specifically referenced herein, necessary to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.
 
(c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party, except that, in the case of removal of a Remarketing Agent by the Company pursuant to Section 6 or termination pursuant to Section 11(b) of this Agreement, the Company shall reimburse the Remarketing Agent or Agents for all of its or their out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Remarketing Agents. Sections 2, 5, 9, 10, 11(c) and 12 shall survive termination of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect.
Section 12. . (a) The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agents shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement and the Indenture. No implied covenants or obligations of or against the Remarketing Agents shall be read into this Agreement or the Indenture. In the absence of bad faith on the part of the Remarketing Agents, the Remarketing Agents may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to them, which purports to conform to the requirements of this Agreement and the Indenture, as to the truth of the statements expressed in any of such documents. The Remarketing Agents shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by them to have been signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties. The Remarketing Agents shall incur no liability hereunder to any Beneficial Owner or Holder of Debentures in their individual capacity or as Remarketing Agents for any action or failure to act in connection with the remarketing or otherwise. A Remarketing Agent shall incur no liability to the Company with respect to calculation of the Reset Yield, except as a result of gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part.
Remarketing Agents' Performance; Duty of Care
(b) The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the transaction contemplated by this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the Remarketing Agents, on the other hand, (ii) in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction the Remarketing Agents are and have been acting solely as a principal and not as the agent (except to the extent expressly provided herein, which the parties acknowledge is solely a contractual obligation) or fiduciary of the Company, or its stockholders, creditors, employees or any other party, (iii) the Remarketing Agents have not assumed nor will they assume an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the transaction contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether the Remarketing Agents have advised or are currently advising the Company on other matters) and the Remarketing Agents have no obligation to the Company with respect to the transaction contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement, (iv) the Remarketing Agents and their affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company, and (v) the Remarketing Agents have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the transaction contemplated hereby and the Company has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.

[DATE]
To the Representatives
named in Schedule I
hereto of the Underwriters
named in Schedule II hereto
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Wells Fargo & Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to sell to the underwriters named in Schedule II hereto (the "Underwriters"), for whom you are acting as Representatives (the "Representatives"), the principal amount of its securities identified in Schedule I hereto (the "Securities"), to be issued under the indenture identified in Schedule I hereto (the "Indenture"), with Citibank, N.A. as the trustee (the "Trustee"). If the firm or firms listed in Schedule II hereto include only the firm or firms listed in Schedule I hereto, then the terms "Underwriters" and "Representatives", as used herein, shall each be deemed to refer to such firm or firms.
1. . The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each Underwriter that:
Representations and Warranties
(a) The Company meets the requirements for use of Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") and has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") an automatic shelf registration statement on such Form as defined in Rule 405 under the Act (the file number of which is set forth in Schedule I hereto) for the registration under the Act of the Securities. Such registration statement, including any amendments thereto, became effective upon filing. The Company proposes to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act a supplement to a form of prospectus included in such registration statement relating to the Securities in the form heretofore delivered to you. Such registration statement, including all exhibits thereto (but excluding the Statements of Eligibility on Form T-1), as amended at the date of this Agreement, and including any prospectus supplement
relating to the Securities that is filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act and deemed part of such registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, is hereinafter called the "Registration Statement"; such prospectus in the form in which it appears in the Registration Statement is hereinafter called the "Basic Prospectus" and such supplemented form of prospectus, in the form in which it shall be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) (including the Basic Prospectus as so supplemented) is hereinafter called the "Final Prospectus". Any preliminary form of the Final Prospectus which has been or will be filed pursuant to Rule 424 is hereinafter called the "Preliminary Final Prospectus". Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") on or before the date of this Agreement, or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference herein to the terms "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the date of this Agreement, or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be, and deemed to be incorporated therein by reference.
(b) As of the date hereof, when the Final Prospectus is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act, when, prior to the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), any amendment to the Registration Statement becomes effective (including the filing of any document incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement), when any supplement to the Final Prospectus is filed with the Commission and at the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), (i) the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such time, and the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of any such time, and the Indenture will comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the "Trust Indenture Act") and the Exchange Act and the respective rules thereunder and (ii) neither the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such time, nor the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of any such time, will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to (i) that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statements of Eligibility on Form T-1 under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee, or (ii) the information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (it being
provided, however,
 
understood and agreed that the only such information contained in the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus furnished by any Underwriter consists of such information described as such in a letter dated the Closing Date (the "Blood Letter") delivered by the Representatives to the Company).
(c) At the Applicable Time, the Disclosure Package does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The preceding sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from the Disclosure Package based upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in the Blood Letter.
(d) (i) At the time of filing the Registration Statement, (ii) at the time of the most recent amendment thereto for the purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or form of prospectus) and (iii) at the time the Company or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this clause only, of Rule 163(c) under the Act) made any offer relating to the Securities in reliance on the exemption in Rule 163 under the Act, the Company was or is (as the case may be) a "well-known seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405 under the Act. The Company agrees to pay the fees required by the Commission relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) under the Act without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) under the Act.
(e) At the earliest time after the filing of the Registration Statement that the Company or another offering participant made a offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2) under the Act) of the Securities, the Company was not and is not an Ineligible Issuer (as defined in Rule 405 under the Act), without taking account of any determination by the Commission pursuant to Rule 405 that it is not necessary that the Company be considered an Ineligible Issuer.
bona fide
(f) Each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus does not include any information that conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement, including any document incorporated therein and any prospectus supplement deemed to be a part thereof that has not been superseded or modified. The foregoing sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus based upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in the Blood Letter.
 
(g) Certain Definitions. For purposes hereof:
(i) "Disclosure Package" shall mean (i) the Basic Prospectus, as amended and supplemented to the Applicable Time, (ii) the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses identified in Schedule III hereto, and (iii) any other Free Writing Prospectus that the parties hereto shall hereafter expressly agree in writing to treat as part of the Disclosure Package.

The Company agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 under the Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.

(ix) the Registration Statement and any amendments thereto have become effective under the Act; to the knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as amended, or any notice under Rule 401(g)(2) that would prevent its use, has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened; the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and each amendment thereof or supplement thereto as of their respective effective or issue dates (other than the financial statements and other financial and statistical information contained therein, other than statements furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of an Underwriter through the Representatives (it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of such information described as such in the Blood Letter) and other than the Statements of Eligibility on Form T-1 included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective rules thereunder; and such counsel has no reason to believe that the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereof, at the time it became effective (other than the financial statements and other financial and statistical information contained therein, other than statements furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of an Underwriter through the Representatives (it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of such information described as such in the Blood Letter) and other than the Statements of Eligibility on Form T-1 included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Final Prospectus, as of its date or as amended or supplemented at the Closing Date (other than the financial statements and other financial and statistical information contained therein, other than statements furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of an Underwriter through the Representatives (it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of such information described as such in the Blood Letter) and other than the Statements of Eligibility on Form T-1 included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), included or includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party to the extent set forth below, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein (it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of such information described as such in the Blood Letter). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity (it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of such information described as such in the Blood Letter). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental investigation), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be
 
made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it shall wish, jointly, with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party). In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to obtain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts of interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate identified firm (in addition to any identified local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives in the case of parties to be indemnified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 7 and by the Company in the case of parties to be indemnified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 7. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its prior written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of the indemnified party.
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 7(a) or 7(b) hereof is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the
 
Company, on the one hand, and each Underwriter, on the other hand, from the offering of such Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and each Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and each Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of such Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by each Underwriter in respect thereof. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and each Underwriter, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by such Underwriter and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. Each Underwriter's obligation to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 shall be several in the proportion that the principal amount of the Securities the sale of which by such Underwriter gave rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities bears to the aggregate principal amount of the Securities the sale of which by all Underwriters gave rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, and not joint.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to Section 7(d) hereof were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d) hereof. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 7(d) hereof shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities referred to in Section 7(d) hereof that were offered and sold to the public through such Underwriter exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
pro rata
8. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the
Default by an Underwriter
 
respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bear to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of such Securities; , that if the remaining Underwriters do not exercise their right to purchase such Securities and arrangements for the purchase of such Securities satisfactory to the Company and the Representatives are not made within 36 hours after such default, then this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
