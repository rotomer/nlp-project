Effective July 1, 2009, the Wells Fargo & Company Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (the "Code") was amended in connection with the Company's review and integration of the ethics policy of Wachovia Corporation, which was merged with the Company on December 31, 2008. The amended Code was adopted by both the Company's Ethics Committee and Board of Directors. The amended Code continues to represent the combined Company's commitment to maintain the highest ethical standards with customers, team members, stockholders and the communities it serves. The Code applies to all Company team members, including the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller or persons performing similar functions.
While there are no material substantive changes to the Code, the amendments to the Code further describe, emphasize or clarify (a) additional Company policies and requirements applicable and resources available to team members to assist them in understanding and complying with their obligations under the Code, (b) compliance obligations under the laws and regulations of jurisdictions in which the Company conducts business, (c) team members' obligations to protect the Company's assets and ensure their proper and efficient use, (d) the duties and obligations of team members with respect to the protection and use of the Company's confidential and proprietary information, (e) the responsibilities of team members to avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest in performance of their duties on behalf of the Company, and (f) administrative responsibilities under the Code, including responsibilities and accountability of managers and senior leaders of the Company with respect to the Code.
A copy of the amended Code is furnished as an exhibit to this Form 8-K. The Code will be posted when it becomes effective on the corporate governance page of the Company's website at www.wellsfargo.com/about/corporate/corporate_governance.

Exhibit 99.1
Wells Fargo Team Member
Code of Ethics and Business Conduct
 
 
Contents
 
I. Wells Fargo's Approach
 
 
Wells Fargo* expects its team members to adhere to the highest possible standards of ethics and business conduct with customers, team members, vendors, stockholders, and the communities it serves, and to comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations that govern our businesses. This Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (the "Code") sets forth Wells Fargo's policy and standards concerning ethical conduct for all team members. Our aim is to promote an atmosphere in which ethical behavior is well recognized as a priority and practiced on a day-to-day basis.
The policy and standards are grouped under section headings that emphasize the fundamental and overriding principles that should guide our behavior: We should act in a manner that will serve the best interests of Wells Fargo; that is honest and trustworthy; that will preserve confidential information; and that will avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest.
This Code cannot provide rules to cover every circumstance. Answers to questions involving ethical considerations are often neither easy nor clear-cut. You should understand and abide by both the spirit and the letter of the policies and standards in the Code and remember that you may not do indirectly what you cannot do directly under the Code. Individuals employed in brokerage, investments or other similar positions governed by licensing requirements are subject to additional requirements which may be more restrictive due to law, regulation, or business practice. If you have a question about a particular situation or your obligations under the Code, discuss it with your supervisor or your Code Administrator. If you violate any provision of the Code or fail to cooperate fully with any inquiries or investigations, you will be subject to corrective action, which may include termination of your employment. A process for resolving issues that arise under the Code is more fully outlined in the Code Administration section ().
Section VI
If you have concerns about conduct that you believe may violate the Code, laws, rules, or regulations, or about accounting, auditing, or internal accounting control matters, you should contact as described in . No retaliation may be taken against a team member for providing information in good faith about possible Code violations, violations of laws, rules, or regulations by others, or concerns about accounting, auditing, or internal accounting control matters.
EthicsLine
Section VII
 
II. Serve Wells Fargo's Best Interests
 
 
Wells Fargo is committed to compliance with federal laws, rules, and regulations, as well as applicable laws, rules, and regulations of all localities, states, and countries where we do business. This includes compliance with all applicable securities laws and regulations, accounting standards, accounting controls, and audit practices.
As a team member, you are expected to support this commitment and serve Wells Fargo's best interest by:
 
 
 
Under certain circumstances, Wells Fargo's policies or local or foreign laws and regulations may be different from the policies outlined in the Code. Generally, in those cases, you must comply with the more restrictive policies, laws, or regulations. When the applicability or interpretation of policies, laws, rules, or regulations is unclear, you must seek advice from your supervisor, your HR consultant, your Code Administrator, or the Law Department, depending on the nature of the inquiry.
This Code provides basic principles and concepts to guide us in the conduct of our business. You are expected to
 
exercise good judgment and common sense in your decision making and your dealings with others. Commitments should be made only if they can be met realistically.
If you become aware of actual or potential problems in any area of Wells Fargo's services or operations or in its business relationships with vendors, or in Wells Fargo's or its representatives' business relationships with domestic or foreign customers or officials, you should inform your supervisor or others in a position to effect solutions.
In addition, you are expected to protect Wells Fargo's assets from theft, waste, or loss and ensure their efficient use. Wells Fargo's assets include physical and intellectual property, such as Wells Fargo's brand, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and patents, as well as the confidential and proprietary information described under the Preserve Confidentiality section () of this Code. While it is not Wells Fargo's intent to claim ownership of intellectual property that is unrelated to Wells Fargo's business, any intellectual property invented, created, designed, or conceived by a team member while employed by Wells Fargo and that may relate to any business of Wells Fargo must be disclosed to Wells Fargo and shall, at Wells Fargo's option, become the sole property of Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo's assets may only be used for legitimate purposes. Any improper use of Wells Fargo's assets, whether for personal or business purposes, including the misapplication or improper use of corporate or customer funds or property or the unauthorized use or publication of intellectual property, is prohibited and may be unlawful.
Section IV
If you become aware of any violations or potential violations of this Code, of applicable laws, rules, or regulations, or of accounting standards or controls, you must promptly report such activity as described in the EthicsLine section () of this Code.
Section VII
III. Act with Honesty, Integrity, and Trustworthiness
 
 
A. Overview
To preserve and foster the public's trust and confidence, complete honesty and fairness is required in conducting internal and external business. It's important that every Wells Fargo team member understands that the honesty, trust, and integrity essential for meeting the highest standards of corporate governance are not just the responsibility of senior management or boards of directors. We all share that responsibility. Corporate ethics is the sum total of the ethical decisions all of us make every day.
To have integrity, one must be consistently honest and trustworthy in everything one does. When you have integrity, people know you will do what you know is right. And that aligns with how we define "culture" at Wells Fargo. It's knowing what you have to do without someone telling you to do it. It is the core of a person's  and a company's  reputation.
B. Company Information
Honesty and fairness require that team members provide accurate and complete information in dealings with customers and others. We will communicate with candor, and each team member will deal fairly with Wells Fargo customers, vendors, competitors, and other team members. You may never take unfair advantage of another through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other intentional unfair-dealing practice.
Wells Fargo is committed to full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in public reports and documents filed with, or submitted or provided to, the Securities and Exchange Commission, regulatory authorities, stockholders, and the public. Wells Fargo & Company's financial statements and reports must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and fairly present, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of Wells Fargo.
C. Accurate Records
You are responsible for preparing and maintaining accurate records to the best of your knowledge and retaining
 
business records in compliance with applicable regulations, law, and Wells Fargo's record retention policies. All business transactions, including team member expense reporting, must be properly and accurately recorded in a timely manner on Wells Fargo's books and records and in accordance with applicable accounting standards, legal requirements, and Wells Fargo's system of internal controls. Falsification of any company or personal information you provide is prohibited.
D. Sales Incentive Programs
As part of Wells Fargo's sales culture, the company creates various incentive programs to reward producers of new business and to obtain new business. This section provides guidance for specific situations involving incentive programs. If any business practice being followed in your area does not meet these guidelines, you should refuse to participate and should report the inappropriate behavior to (see ).
EthicsLine
Section VII
1. Sales to Relatives and Friends
Wells Fargo recognizes that relatives and friends are one source of new business. Within these guidelines, incentive programs generally allow team members to receive credit and any related compensation for legitimate sales to, or referrals of, relatives or friends. Business units may place more restrictive guidelines on sales to relatives or friends to ensure that conflicts of interest or perceptions of conflicts of interest are avoided.
2. Inappropriate Sales
Steering a customer to an inappropriate or unnecessary product to receive sales credit harms the customer; it is an unacceptable practice that violates both the spirit and the letter of our incentive programs and this Code.
3. Gaming
Any form of "gaming" to receive compensation, to meet sales goals, or for any other reason is in direct violation of company policy and this Code. Gaming is defined as the manipulation and/or misrepresentation of sales or sales reporting in an attempt to receive compensation or to meet sales goals. Gaming issues may arise in, but are not limited to, the following categories of activities:
 
 
 
 
 
 
E. Undue Influence
It is not appropriate for you to influence, or attempt to influence, anyone for the purpose of having them handle a transaction or process in a way that results in an improper personal benefit to you, your friends, relatives, or even to that particular team member. Such improper benefit may result from using a relationship (whether personal,
 
social, or professional) to prevail upon another person, such as a coworker, vendor, or someone who reports to you, to do something for you that is outside the scope of standard business practice. In addition, undue influence may take the form of pressuring, intimidating, or threatening another person in an attempt to persuade him or her to take an action that is inconsistent with standard business practice.
The services of others, such as vendors, brokers, appraisers, or attorneys, should be selected on the basis of quality, price, and other factors that may be appropriate in particular cases and family relationships or friendships should never be a factor. Team members should not attempt to influence selection of a vendor based on a family relationship or friendship. Neither you, a family member, nor any entity in which you or your family member has a financial interest or by which you or your family member is employed, may supply goods or services to a business unit of Wells Fargo in which you are employed without prior approval of the transaction by your Code Administrator. You do not need prior approval when the vendor is:
 
 
With respect to engagement of professionals or consultants, a team member's business unit may engage a professional firm (such as an accounting firm, law firm, or investment bank) that is owned in part by or employs a team member's family member. However, such team member may not request or act to influence such engagement and must notify his or her supervisor or Code Administrator of such relationship as soon as possible.
F. Payment Verification
You are expected to check your pay voucher (online or paper) and/or direct deposit receipts for accuracy, and are required to report immediately to your supervisor any overpayment  including, but not limited to, wages, salary, payments under the Wells Fargo Short Term Disability Plan, incentive pay, bonuses, or Paid Time Off. Your supervisor will work with you to make appropriate arrangements to reimburse the company. Failure to report discrepancies or to make appropriate repayment arrangements is a violation of company policy and this Code.
IV. Preserve Confidentiality
 
 
A. Overview
Confidentiality has always been an essential part of the financial industry's business. Wells Fargo's customers give us private information about themselves and rightfully trust us to keep this information in confidence. Today we have technology that enables us to keep more information about customers than ever before. Recognizing this, Wells Fargo has placed special emphasis on the appropriate collection, storage, and use of customer information. Moreover, Wells Fargo has provided team members with access to computers, electronic mail, the intranet, and the internet. This access is a privilege that carries special responsibilities. This section is about your responsibility to protect confidential and proprietary information from release or misuse.
B. Confidential Information
Your role in privacy protection is critical. As a team member, you will have access to confidential information about Wells Fargo, its customers, team members, and vendors which you are obligated to protect from unauthorized disclosure. Such information is intended solely for use within Wells Fargo and is limited to those with a business need-to-know. Confidential information acquired by a team member through his or her employment must be held in the strictest confidence and, except for a business reason, must never be discussed with anyone  not even family members. Such information is to be used solely for corporate purposes and never for personal gain, and may not be used to compete with Wells Fargo.
You may not access confidential information without a business purpose. You must not disclose confidential information you have obtained in the course of your employment to any other team member unless the other team member has a business need to know the information for the performance of his or her duties on behalf of Wells
 
Fargo.
Wells Fargo protects the private, personal, and proprietary information of customers, vendors, and team members. Confidential customer information may not be disclosed to persons outside Wells Fargo except when its disclosure is required by law or in accordance with Wells Fargo's privacy policies and customer agreements. In addition, Wells Fargo may have entered into a confidentiality or nondisclosure agreement to protect a third party's confidential information and prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of that information. You must be careful to honor those agreements.
Furthermore, you must comply with additional policies maintained by applicable business units that restrict the flow of confidential information between their business unit and other Wells Fargo business units that are engaged in investment advisory or securities trading activities.
Improper release of or unauthorized access to confidential information damages our customer's trust in Wells Fargo and can result in loss of business and even legal action. It also reflects on your ability to do your job and is a violation of company policy and this Code.
C. Proprietary Information
Information that is classified by Wells Fargo as "internal use" (limited to Wells Fargo team members, contractors, and vendors covered by a nondisclosure agreement); "confidential" (intended solely for use within Wells Fargo and limited to those with business need-to-know); and "restricted" (intended solely for restricted use within Wells Fargo and limited to those with an explicit, predetermined, and stringent need to know) is considered proprietary information; that is, information that is the property of Wells Fargo. It includes, without limitation, trade secrets and information regarding:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the time you are a Wells Fargo team member, you must not:
 
 
If you leave Wells Fargo, you may not:
 
 
 
V. Avoid Conflicts of Interest
 
 
A. Overview
Team members must avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest in their personal and business activities. The appearance of a conflict of interest may be just as damaging to the reputation of Wells Fargo as the existence of an actual conflict of interest. A conflict of interest is a situation in which your personal interest or outside economic interest in a matter:
 
 
 
 
 
When presented with a situation involving a potential conflict of interest, you should ask: Would public disclosure of the matter embarrass Wells Fargo or lead an outside observer to believe that a conflict exists? The sections that follow provide rules and guidance for specific situations in which the possibility of a conflict of interest is present. Certain activities must be strictly avoided and others require written approval before they can be undertaken.
If a conflict or potential conflict of interest arises in circumstances not discussed under the rules that follow or if application of a rule to a set of circumstances is unclear, you should consult your supervisor or Code Administrator. In some cases it may be necessary to obtain approval or disclose the possible conflict in writing to your Code Administrator for consideration by the member of the Operating Committee for your business group or the Ethics Committee.
B. Standards for Personal Finances
As a financial institution, Wells Fargo's business depends on public confidence in our ability to help manage the financial affairs of others. In general, your personal finances are private. However, because you represent Wells Fargo, it is important that you manage your personal finances properly and in a prudent manner.
If you are having financial difficulties, you may talk to Employee Assistance Consulting (EAC), which can provide confidential advice and referrals to community resources. If your business unit does not use EAC, please contact your HR consultant for assistance.
C. Insider Trading
Insider trading involves the purchase or sale of securities of an entity while in possession of material, nonpublic information (also called "inside information") about the entity. Any person who purchases or sells securities while in possession of material inside information, or who communicates or "tips" such inside information to anyone else who trades securities on such information, violates this Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and may violate federal and state securities laws. Federal law imposes obligations on employers to ensure that their employees do not improperly trade securities using material inside information. If you commit an insider trading violation, you may be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties, your supervisor may possibly be subject to significant civil penalties, and you may be subject to immediate termination of employment.
In addition, you may be subject to information sharing restrictions or "firewalls" that are designed to restrict the flow of information from business units and other areas of Wells Fargo that regularly come into possession of
 
material inside information to those business units that regularly trade in public securities, including securities of Wells Fargo's customers and vendors. Sharing a customer's material inside information with Wells Fargo business units that trade in public securities could require our brokers or traders to stop trading in the customer's securities until the information becomes public. For example, if Wells Fargo receives material inside information that is adverse to a customer in connection with a loan at a time when Wells Fargo holds the customer's stock in fiduciary accounts, Wells Fargo's credit approvers are obligated to prevent such material inside information from being disclosed to team members who trade securities for Wells Fargo's fiduciary accounts.
1. Material Inside Information
"Inside" or "nonpublic information" is information about a business organization that is not generally available to or known by the public. Such information is considered to be "material" if the information could reasonably be expected to affect the market price of a company's securities or there is a likelihood that it would be considered important by an investor in making a decision to buy or sell a company's securities (whether stock, bonds, notes, debentures, limited partnership units, or other equity or debt securities). Both positive and negative information may be material. Information should be presumed "material" if it relates to, among other things, any of the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Restrictions Against Insider Trading
You must not purchase or sell securities if you are aware of material inside information, either personally or for any account over which you have direct or indirect control. You are also prohibited from disclosing material inside information in your possession to your family members or others (i.e., "tipping") except to those Wells Fargo team members and outside professionals who have a need to know the information in order to perform their duties on behalf of Wells Fargo. If you disclose material inside information in violation of this Code and if the person you tip trades securities while in possession of such information, both you and the person trading may be liable under federal and state securities laws.
If you have material inside information about a customer or vendor of Wells Fargo, you are responsible for ensuring that any purchase or sale of the customer's or vendor's securities by you or for any account over which you have direct or indirect control is in compliance with the "Insider Trading" and "Personal Trading and Investment" provisions of this Code. Questions regarding whether information is "inside information" or "material" should be referred to your supervisor, your Code Administrator, or to the Corporate Secretary of Wells Fargo & Company.
3. Purchases and Sales of Securities Issued By Wells Fargo
You may not purchase or sell securities issued by Wells Fargo & Company if you have material inside information
 
about Wells Fargo & Company. Any team member who has a question regarding whether information about Wells Fargo & Company may be deemed to be "material inside information" should call the Corporate Secretary of Wells Fargo & Company. Executive officers of Wells Fargo & Company and those in other positions expressly identified by the General Counsel of Wells Fargo & Company must obtain prior approval from the General Counsel or the Corporate Secretary for all purchases and sales of securities issued by Wells Fargo & Company, including transfers into or out of a Wells Fargo stock fund in an employee benefit plan. See section D.2. below regarding the general prohibition on engaging in derivative and hedging transactions in securities issued by Wells Fargo & Company.
D. Personal Trading and Investment
It is important that investments by team members for their personal accounts or accounts over which they have direct or indirect control do not involve  or do not appear to involve  conflicts of interest. Team members must avoid or disclose certain types of personal investments. For example, a team member may not:
 
 
1. Investment in a Wells Fargo Customer or Vendor
A team member who directly or indirectly holds an investment in or an option to acquire an interest in securities (such as stock, bonds, notes, debentures, interests in limited partnerships, or other equity or debt securities), or makes a loan to, or guarantees an obligation of a customer or vendor may have a conflict of interest when representing Wells Fargo with respect to the customer or vendor. For this reason, team members and any family member residing with them must not invest in a customer or vendor of Wells Fargo unless they do not have material inside information about the customer or vendor, :
and
 
 
 
Under the following circumstances, you are required to obtain approval from your Code Administrator before you or a family member who resides with you invests in any business entity with which Wells Fargo has a business relationship:
 
 
If you or a family member who resides with you own an investment or an option to acquire an interest in, have loaned money to, or have guaranteed the obligations of an entity that later becomes a customer or vendor of Wells Fargo and, in turn, that investment is brought under this rule, you must notify your Code Administrator as soon as practical and act at his or her direction to prevent or resolve any conflict of interest.
2. Derivative and Hedging Transactions in Securities Issued by Wells Fargo
You may not invest or engage in derivative or hedging transactions involving securities issued by Wells Fargo & Company, including but not limited to options contracts (other than employee stock options), puts, calls, short sales, futures contracts, or other similar transactions regardless of whether you have material inside information.
Individuals employed in the brokerage, investment banking, investment research, advisory and trust or investment management units of Wells Fargo and senior officers of Wells Fargo who make or supervise fiduciary investment
 
decisions are subject to additional requirements and restrictions.
E. Financial Services
Although many of Wells Fargo's financial services are provided to team members at no cost or favorable rates, team members are expected to properly manage the use of those services. Misuse of Wells Fargo services will result in the same penalties or restrictions that apply to customers. For example, if you repeatedly issue checks for more than the collected funds balance in your checking account, your checking account will be closed.
Wells Fargo prohibits improper transactions by team members, such as but not limited to kiting, writing worthless personal checks, and conducting fraudulent or worthless electronic transactions (such as making false ATM deposits to receive immediate cash). An example of kiting is floating funds between two or more different accounts to cover withdrawals, or making transactions against funds that are not available.
Wells Fargo reserves the right to review all team member accounts at any Wells Fargo bank or any other subsidiaries or affiliates for unusual activity, both regularly and during investigations.
F. Transactions with Wells Fargo
Wells Fargo maintains an extensive system of internal controls in order to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and all transactions are properly recorded.
1. Personal Transactions
You must transact all personal financial business with Wells Fargo following the same procedures that are used by customers and from the customer side of the window or desk, unless specific team member procedures apply or you are a full service registered representative subject to the exception described below. You are not allowed to handle or approve your own transactions, or transactions on accounts over which you have any ownership interest, control, or signing authority. This includes transactions for a business if the team member owns that business. These transactions must be handled by personnel other than the team member for whom the transaction is conducted. Any team member found transacting personal business for both him or herself and Wells Fargo will be assumed to be in violation of the Code and internal operating policy and procedures.
Monetary and nonmonetary transactions must be processed by another team member. This includes, but is not limited to, the following transactions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
If your transaction requires approval, the approval must come from the next higher level of authority. You may not request approval of personal transactions by a coworker or by anyone you directly or indirectly supervise.
A team member who is a full service registered representative and whose job responsibilities authorize him or her to recommend, solicit, and place orders to buy or sell securities is permitted under the Code to place orders for his or her own brokerage account and the brokerage accounts of family members from whom the team member has written authorization to place such orders and on whose accounts the team member is listed as the broker of record. Such transactions are subject to all fees and commissions as provided in the applicable fee schedule. A business unit may, in its discretion, limit or deny this authorization for a team member or group of team members to place orders in their own brokerage accounts or brokerage accounts of family members.
You may not directly or indirectly (including through family members) purchase real or personal property that has been repossessed or foreclosed upon by Wells Fargo, or is being marketed or sold at Wells Fargo's direction as servicer of a loan. For real estate transactions, most of these properties are listed on pasreo.com, and you should check with your agent to determine who the seller is, or whether the agent works for Premiere Asset Services,
 
which is a trade name used by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
This property purchase restriction includes property where the sale is contingent upon Wells Fargo's approval as a result of its servicing of a loan secured by the property. This means a team member may not purchase a property where Wells Fargo is the servicer of a loan secured by that property and Wells Fargo is not receiving a full payoff, which is often referred to as a "short sale."
2. Overdrafts, Fees, Service Charges, and Rate Concessions
You may not approve overdrafts or reverse or waive fees or service charges for:
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, the decision to pay or waive charges for your own overdraft must not be made by any team member in a position in which you could exert either purposeful or inadvertent pressure on that team member to pay an overdraft or waive or reduce charges merely because of your job relationship.
The fact that a team member is a treasurer or officer of a corporation, municipality, county, political fund, nonprofit corporation, or escrow trustee fund does not warrant or justify rate concessions for personal borrowing or fee waivers on other forms of business which are not available to similarly situated customers.
3. Account Relationships
Without approval from your Code Administrator, you may not act as cotenant, cosign on a deposit account, or act as a cotenant or deputy for a safe deposit renter, unless the account relationship belongs to:
 
 
Before approval will be considered, your supervisor (or another officer with higher authority) must privately contact the customer on whose account you will become a cotenant or cosigner. The customer must acknowledge, in writing, that the arrangement is being made with his or her own free will and consent.
G. Borrowing, Lending, and Other Credit Transactions
Except for normal credit extended by merchants to cover purchases of goods or services, you must not borrow from any customer or vendor of Wells Fargo, even at the customer's suggestion, unless the customer is a family member or other relative or a recognized lending institution, and the terms are comparable to the terms the institution offers to other borrowers.
You must not lend personal funds to, cosign, endorse, guarantee, or otherwise assume responsibility for the borrowings of any customer or vendor of Wells Fargo unless the customer or vendor is a family member, other relative, or close personal friend and the personal or family relationship, and not the company's business, is the basis for the transaction.
If a customer has funds to invest, you may not propose that the customer lend the funds to you or otherwise offer investment advice unless authorized to do so.
A team member in a direct or indirect reporting relationship (the immediate supervisor or any manager who is above the supervisor in the chain of reporting relationships, or who has significant influence over the team member even if in a different business unit) must not lend money to or borrow money from another Wells Fargo team member in that reporting relationship. You may make an occasional loan of nominal value (such as for lunch) to another team member so long as no interest is charged.
Extensions of credit from almost all of the company's bank subsidiaries to executive officers, directors, their related interests and other insiders as identified in Regulation O are subject to various restrictions, and may be
 
required to be approved by or reported to the lending bank's board of directors.
You may not accept or solicit for yourself any type of payment from a customer or other individual or entity for obtaining or trying to obtain a loan from the bank.
You may not approve credit, purchases, or other agreements for Wells Fargo if you, a family member, or other relative has a personal or financial interest in the individual or organization seeking credit or other agreements from Wells Fargo.
H. Business Expenses
Unless otherwise approved by the Audit and Examination Committee of the Board of Directors of Wells Fargo & Company, you may not approve your own expenses or request approval of those expenses by anyone who reports directly or indirectly to you. Approval of expenses must be obtained in accordance with the policies of your business unit and from the next highest authority in your business unit.
I. Handling Business Opportunities
1. Corporate Opportunities
You may not take advantage of opportunities that rightly belong to Wells Fargo. For example, you may not:
 
 
 
2. Referrals
You may not refer a customer whose credit application was denied by Wells Fargo to a third-party credit source in return for a commission, nor may you offer to advance credit to the customer on your own (for instance, offering to provide a personally financed second mortgage). In this instance, team members should provide the customer with a list of several reputable alternate credit sources, without indicating a preference, unless the team member's business unit participates in a Wells Fargo-sponsored internal referral program.
J. Advice to Customers
Wells Fargo's ability to offer many services is either prohibited or strictly limited by government regulation. If you are asked to recommend professional services that are not provided through Wells Fargo's own referral sources, for instance, if asked for advice about real estate agents or attorneys, you may provide a list of several qualifying sources without indicating favoritism or making a specific recommendation.
K. Guidelines for Activities Outside the Company
You are expected to devote full time to Wells Fargo's interests during regular working hours and during any additional time that is required. While Wells Fargo recognizes that involvement in civic and political activities is beneficial to your personal growth and influence within your community and profession, as well as to Wells Fargo, participation in outside activities must not adversely affect your performance of your duties for Wells Fargo. Outside activities that compete with Wells Fargo's business or present a conflict or potential conflict of interest are not permitted.
Participation in an outside business or other outside activity involves responsibilities and risks of which you need to be aware and need to be willing to assume. Approval shall not imply that you are serving at the direction or request of Wells Fargo.
1. Outside Business and Employment Activities
With the exception of a sole proprietorship, family-owned small business, or ownership of less than a 10% interest
 
in a privately held business as described below, you may not accept a position as a director, trustee, officer, manager, or general partner or own 10% or more of any outside business organized for profit without obtaining approval of a member of the Operating Committee for your business group or the Ethics Committee. Service as a director means serving as a member of a board of directors, board of managers or a board of trustees. It does not include serving on an advisory board. If approval is granted, it will be contingent on the following factors:
 
 
 
Approval to serve as a director of a publicly held corporation must be obtained from the Chief Executive Officer of Wells Fargo & Company.
You may have other employment, act as a sole proprietor, be involved in a family-owned small business, or own less than a 10% interest in a privately held business without prior approval as long as the outside employment or business does not involve an activity or business that competes with Wells Fargo, cause an actual or potential conflict of interest or otherwise negatively affect your duties and responsibilities to Wells Fargo. Any team member who desires to accept competing or conflicting outside employment must request an exception to the Code.
Any approval of these outside business and employment activities as required by the Code must be in writing by the member of the Operating Committee for your business group or the Ethics Committee. If you receive approval to participate in outside business or employment activities, your participation must be redisclosed and reapproved at any time there is a change in relevant facts upon which the original approval was granted.
Team members with securities licenses and team members who are associated with a broker-dealer must comply with outside activities reporting requirements. Additional policies and procedures may apply to such team members.
Competing or conflicting outside employment or business activities includes any position or activity that:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Some other outside employment or business activity, while generally discouraged, may be permitted under limited circumstances with advance approval under . Such employment or business may include:
