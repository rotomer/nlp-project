Such registration statement, including any amendments thereto, became effective upon filing and no order suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement has been issued by the Commission and no proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Act against the Company or related to the offering has been initiated or threatened by the Commission. The Company proposes to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act a supplement to a form of prospectus included in such registration statement relating to the Shares in the form
heretofore delivered to you. Such registration statement, including all exhibits thereto, as amended at the date of this Agreement, and including any prospectus supplement relating to the Shares that is filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act and deemed part of such registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, is hereinafter called the "Registration Statement"; such prospectus in the form in which it appears in the Registration Statement is hereinafter called the "Basic Prospectus" and such supplemented form of prospectus, in the form in which it shall be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) (including the Basic Prospectus as so supplemented) is hereinafter called the "Final Prospectus". Any preliminary form of the Final Prospectus which has been or will be filed pursuant to Rule 424 is hereinafter called the "Preliminary Final Prospectus". Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") on or before the date of this Agreement, or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference herein to the terms "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the date of this Agreement, or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be, and deemed to be incorporated therein by reference.

(b) If there occurs an event or development as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include an untrue statement of a material fact or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will promptly notify the Representatives so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented and will, upon request of the Representatives, amend or supplement the Disclosure Package to correct such statement or omission.
(c) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Shares is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 under the Act), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, including in connection with use or delivery of the Final Prospectus, the Company will promptly notify you and will, upon your request, prepare and file with the Commission an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance.

provided, however,
 
would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject or subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.

under the National Bank Act of 1864, as amended; and WFC Holdings Corporation ("WFC Holdings" and together with Wells Fargo Bank and Wachovia Bank, the "Significant Subsidiaries") is a duly organized and validly existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware;
(B) each of the Company and the Significant Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction which requires such qualification wherein it owns or leases any material properties or conducts any material business, except where the failure to so qualify would not have any material adverse effect upon the business, condition or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
(C) all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each Significant Subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and (except as provided in 12 U.S.C. 55 in the case of Wells Fargo Bank and Wachovia Bank) nonassessable, and are owned directly or indirectly by the Company free and clear of any perfected security interest and, to the knowledge of such counsel, any other security interests, claims, liens or encumbrances;
(D) the number and type of equity securities the Company is authorized to issue is as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus; all the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable; the capital stock of the Company conforms in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus;
(E) to such counsel's knowledge, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened which are required to be disclosed in the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus, other than as disclosed therein, and there is no contract or other document of a character required to be described or referred to in the Registration Statement or required to be filed as an exhibit thereto other than those described or referred to therein or filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits thereto, and the description thereof or references thereto are correct;
(F) neither the issue and sale of the Shares being delivered on the Closing Date or such Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, nor the consummation of any other of the transactions herein contemplated nor the fulfillment of the terms hereof will result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, any indenture or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any Significant Subsidiary is a party or bound and which constitutes a material contract and is set forth as an exhibit to the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or any subsequent
 
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K, or any other indenture or material agreement or instrument known to such counsel and to which the Company or any Significant Subsidiary is a party or bound, the breach of which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or violate any order, law or regulation known to such counsel to be applicable to the Company or any Significant Subsidiary of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body or arbitrator having jurisdiction over the Company or any Significant Subsidiary; nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company;
(G) the statements in the Final Prospectus (other than statements furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of an Underwriter through the Representatives, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of such information described as such in the Blood Letter) under the captions "Description of Common Stock", and "Underwriting" insofar as they purport to summarize certain provisions of documents or laws specifically referred to therein, are accurate summaries of such provisions or laws or of the sources from which such summaries were derived;
(H) the Shares conform in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus; the Shares have been duly and validly authorized, and, when issued and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable; the Shares have been duly authorized for listing, subject to official notice of issuance, on the New York Stock Exchange; and holders of outstanding shares of common stock of the Company are not entitled to statutory or contractual preemptive rights in connection with the issuance of the Shares;
(I) this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
(J) no consent, approval, authorization or order of any court or government agency or body is required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, except such as have been obtained under the Act and such as may be required under the Blue Sky laws of any jurisdiction or FINRA regulations in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Shares by the Underwriters; and
(K) such counsel has no reason to believe that the Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which
 
they were made, not misleading (other than the financial statements and related notes and other financial and financial reserve information and statistical and accounting data contained therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion).
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Minnesota and the Delaware General Corporation Law or the United States, to the extent deemed proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of counsel who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters; and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and public officials.
(ii) Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz shall have furnished to the Representatives, at the request of the Company, an opinion or opinions, satisfactory to the Representatives, substantially in the form of Annex A hereto.
(c) The Representatives shall have received from their counsel such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Shares, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as it requests for the purpose of enabling it to pass upon such matters.
(d) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by any Senior Vice President or Executive Vice President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, to the effect that:
(i) the representations and warranties of the Company in Section 1 hereof are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date or such Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, with the same effect as if made on such date, and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date or such Additional Closing Date, as the case may be;
(ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as amended, or notice under Rule 401(g)(2) that would prevent its use, has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened; and
(iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, earnings, business, properties or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus.
 
(e) On the date hereof and at the Closing Date and any Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, KPMG LLP, who has certified certain financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, shall have furnished to the Representatives, at the request of the Company, letters, dated the respective dates of delivery thereof and addressed to the Underwriters, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, containing statements and information of the type customarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus; that the letters delivered on the Closing Date or such Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, shall use a "cut-off" date no more than five business days prior to such Closing Date or such Additional Closing Date, as the case may be.
provided,
(f) As of the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, there shall not have occurred since the date hereof any change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business, properties, results of operations or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from that set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of the date hereof, that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and that makes it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable to market or sell the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated by Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus, as so amended or supplemented.
(g) No action shall have been taken, to the Company's knowledge, and no statute, rule, regulation or order shall have been enacted, adopted or issued by any federal, state or foreign governmental or regulatory authority that would, as of the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, prevent the issuance or sale of the Shares; and no injunction or order of any federal, state or foreign court shall have been issued that would, as of the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, prevent the issuance or sale of the Shares.
(h) The Shares to be delivered on the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, shall have been approved for listing on the Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance.
(i) The "lock-up" agreements, each substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, between you and the officers and directors of the Company specified on Schedule IV hereto relating to sales and certain other dispositions of shares of Stock or certain other securities, delivered to you on or before the date hereof, shall be in full force and effect on the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, as the case may be.
If (i) any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled when and as provided in this Agreement, or (ii) any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and their counsel, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be cancelled on, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
 
6. If the sale of the Shares provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 5 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally upon demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and those described in Section 4(j) hereof) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Shares.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses.
7. .
Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement for the registration of the Shares as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party to the extent set forth below, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein (it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of such information described as such in the Blood Letter). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided, however,
(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity (it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of such information described as such in the Blood Letter). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental investigation), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under clause (a) or (b) of this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under clause (a) or (b) of this Section 7. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it shall wish, jointly, with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party). In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to obtain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts of interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate identified firm (in addition to any identified local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives in the case of parties to be indemnified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 7 and by the Company in the case of parties to be indemnified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 7. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its prior written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of the indemnified party.
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 7(a) or 7(b) hereof is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to
 
the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and each Underwriter, on the other hand, from the offering of such Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and each Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and each Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of such Shares shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by each Underwriter in respect thereof. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and each Underwriter, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by such Underwriter and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. Each Underwriter's obligation to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 shall be several in the proportion that the number Shares the sale of which by such Underwriter gave rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities bears to the aggregate number of Shares the sale of which by all Underwriters gave rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, and not joint.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to Section 7(d) hereof were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d) hereof. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 7(d) hereof shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares referred to in Section 7(d) hereof that were offered and sold to the public through such Underwriter exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11 (f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
pro rata
8. If on the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Shares agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder on such date, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective
Default by an Underwriter.
 
proportions which the number of shares of the Shares set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bear to the aggregate number of shares of the Shares set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Shares which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such date; that in the event that the aggregate number of the Shares which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such date shall exceed 10% of the aggregate number of the Shares to be purchased on the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of such Shares; that if the remaining Underwriters do not exercise their right to purchase such Shares and arrangements for the purchase of such Shares satisfactory to the Company and the Representatives are not made within 36 hours after such default, then this Agreement or, with respect to any Additional Closing Date, the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase Shares on such Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
provided, however,
provided further,
9. (a) Each Underwriter severally agrees that it will timely file with the Corporate Financing Department of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (the "Association") any documents required to be filed under Rules 2710 and 2720 of the Association's Conduct Rules relating to the offering of the Shares.
Underwriter Representations and Agreements.
(b) In the event that the offer or sale of the Shares by an Underwriter in any jurisdiction requires any action on the part of the Company in or with respect to such jurisdiction, such Underwriter represents and agrees that it will (i) inform the Company that the Company is required to take such action prior to the time such action is required to be taken, and (ii) cooperate with and assist the Company in complying with such requirements. Each Underwriter severally agrees that it will, to the best of its knowledge and belief, comply with all applicable securities laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction in which it purchases, offers, sells or delivers the Shares or possesses or distributes any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or any other offering material relating to the Shares, and will use its reasonable efforts to obtain any required consent, approval or permission for its purchase, offer, sale or delivery of the Shares under the laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which it is subject or in which it makes any such purchases, offers, sales or deliveries.
10. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Underwritten Shares on the Closing Date or, in the case of the Option Shares, prior to any Additional Closing Date, if prior to such time there shall have occurred any (i) suspension or material limitation of trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the
Termination.
 
NASDAQ Global Market or a material disruption in settlement services in the United States, (ii) suspension of trading of any securities of the Company on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) declaration of a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in California or New York by either Federal or state authorities, (iv) lowering of the rating assigned to any debt securities of the Company by any nationally-recognized securities rating agency or public announcement by any such rating agency that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative consequences, its rating of any debt securities of the Company or (v) outbreak or escalation of hostilities in which the United States is involved, declaration of war by Congress or change in financial markets or calamity or crisis including, without limitation, an act of terrorism, that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and, in the case of any of the events described in clauses (i) through (v), such event, either alone or together with any other such event, makes it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable to proceed with completion of the public offering of, or sale of and payment for, the Shares at the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, as the case may be.
11. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Shares. The provisions of Sections 6 and 7 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive.
12. Unless otherwise provided herein, all notices required under the terms and provisions hereof shall be in writing, either delivered by hand, by mail or by facsimile, telex, telecopier, or telegram and confirmed to the recipient, and any such notice shall be effective when received if sent to the Representatives, at the addresses specified in Schedule I hereto, or if sent to the Company, at 444 Market Street, MAC: 0195-171, San Francisco, California, 94111.
Notices.
13. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.
Successors.
14. The Company hereby acknowledges that (a) the purchase and sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters and any affiliate through which it may be acting, on the other, (b) the Underwriters are acting as principal and not as an agent or fiduciary of the Company under this Agreement and (c) the Company's engagement of the Underwriters in connection with the offering and the process leading up to the offering is as independent contractors and not in any other capacity. Furthermore, the Company agrees that it is solely responsible for making its own judgments in connection with the offering (irrespective of whether any of the Underwriters has advised or is currently advising the Company on related or other matters). The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owe an agency or fiduciary duty to the Company, in connection with the purchase and sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement or the process leading to such purchase and sale.
No Fiduciary Duty.
 
15. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the several Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
Integration.
16. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO.
As Representatives of
the several Underwriters listed in
Schedule 1 to the Underwriting
Agreement referred to below
c/o Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
375 Park Avenue
New York, NY 10152
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
The undersigned understands that you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters, propose to enter into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Wells Fargo & Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), providing for the public offering (the "Public Offering") by the several Underwriters named in Schedule II to the Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriters"), of common stock, of the Company (the "Shares"). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.
