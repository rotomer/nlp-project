Selected Financial Information
 
SAN FRANCISCO  Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC) reported diluted earnings per common share of $0.55 for second quarter 2010 compared with $0.45 for first quarter 2010 and $0.57 for second quarter 2009. Net income was $3.06 billion for second quarter 2010 compared with $2.55 billion in first quarter 2010 and $3.17 billion in second quarter 2009. For the six months ended June 30, 2010, the Company's net income was $5.6 billion, or $1.00 per share, compared with $6.2 billion, or $1.13 per share, a year ago.
"Over the course of the quarter, our 278,000 team members focused steadfastly on serving customers, generating strong earnings performance across our diverse lines of business and increasing market share across many of our businesses," said Chairman and CEO John Stumpf. "We also made strong progress in the successful integration of Wachovia. We have completed approximately half of the integration process, as we prepare to convert our eastern markets to Wells Fargo beginning in the fall.
"Wells Fargo's consistent business model and strong financial performance position us to serve a key role as our nation continues to recover from the recent financial crisis and regain its economic vibrancy and leadership. Having long supported a legal and regulatory environment that promotes consumer protections, financial reporting transparency and clarity, as well as prudent risk management, we support the general principles inherent in the financial reform bill, as they are consistent with how Wells Fargo operates. We remain concerned that some aspects of regulatory reform may have unintended negative impacts for America's financial system, consumers and businesses.
"Nevertheless, as this new chapter in financial services begins, we will remain true to our time-tested business model by deepening customer relationships, cross selling our array of financial products, increasing the number of accounts and providing superior customer service. We are encouraged by signs of continued improvement in the credit landscape. We remain confident about Wells Fargo's future and are optimistic about America's road to financial recovery."

Financial Performance
"We were very pleased with the Company's financial results this quarter," said Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins. "While economic recovery in the U.S. and abroad remained uneven, Wells Fargo earned record net income applicable to common stock of $2.9 billion, with net income of $3.06 billion  the fourth time since the merger that quarterly net income was greater than $3.0 billion. Despite declining loan demand since early last year and lower mortgage hedging results in second quarter, total revenue and pre-tax pre-provision profit remained strong at $21.4 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively, with linked-quarter growth in the franchise driven by businesses as diverse as commercial banking, investment banking, wealth management, asset-based lending, auto dealer services, debit card and global remittance. In the six quarters since the merger with Wachovia, Wells Fargo has earned cumulative profits of $17.9 billion reflecting the breadth of our business model and the power of the consolidation with Wachovia. The merger integration activities are proceeding on track and the combined company continues to produce financial results including revenue synergies better than our original expectations. We believe credit quality has indeed turned the corner, with net charge-offs declining to $4.5 billion, down 16 percent from first quarter and down 17 percent from last year's peak quarter, and we expect this positive trend will continue over the coming year. Our capital ratios continued to build rapidly, with Tier 1 common reaching 7.53 percent and Tier 1 capital at 10.42 percent, even with the purchase of $540 million of Wells Fargo warrants auctioned by the U.S. Treasury."
Revenue
Revenue was $21.4 billion, essentially flat from first quarter, and pre-tax pre-provision profit was $8.6 billion. Reflecting the breadth and growth potential of the Company's business model, many businesses had double-digit revenue growth linked quarter including commercial and corporate banking (deposit growth, an increase in new loan commitments and higher loan resolution income), investment banking (syndication activity), commercial real estate brokerage (deal flow), asset-based lending (loan volume and syndications), international (customer foreign exchange activity), auto dealer services (loan growth), merchant service (processing volume), and debit cards (increased account activity).
Net Interest Income
Net interest income was $11.4 billion, up 11 percent (annualized) from $11.1 billion in first quarter 2010. The net interest margin increased 11 basis points from the prior quarter to 4.38 percent. Most of the increase in net interest margin in the quarter was due to additional PCI loan resolution income. Continued strong growth in consumer and commercial checking and savings accounts offset the impact on income and margin from the decline in loans.
Table of Contents
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income was $9.9 billion compared with $10.3 billion in first quarter 2010 and $10.7 billion a year ago. The year-over-year decline was due to lower mortgage banking revenue. Linked quarter results reflected solid growth in deposit services (up 26 percent annualized on account growth), trust and investment fees (up 11 percent annualized on customer and balance growth), and card fees (up 21 percent annualized on seasonally higher customer activity). Trading revenue declined $428 million linked quarter, partially offset by a $245 million increase in net gains from equity investments.
Mortgage banking noninterest income of $2.0 billion included:
At June 30, 2010, the Company had net unrealized gains on securities available for sale of $8.6 billion, compared with $7.4 billion at March 31, 2010.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense was $12.7 billion compared with $12.1 billion in first quarter 2010. Second quarter noninterest expense included $498 million of merger-related costs (up $118 million from prior quarter) and $137 million of severance costs related to the previously announced Wells Fargo Financial restructuring. Operating losses were $627 million, up $419 million from the prior quarter primarily due to additional litigation accruals. The efficiency ratio was 59.6 percent compared with 56.5 percent in the first quarter and 56.4 percent in second quarter 2009, with the increase largely due to additional merger expenses, litigation accruals and Wells Fargo Financial's restructuring costs.

Loans
Average total loans were $772.5 billion compared with $797.4 billion in first quarter 2010 and $833.9 billion a year ago reflecting continued lower demand for credit from consumer customers. "Several consumer portfolios increased during the quarter, including auto dealer services, private student lending and Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement," said Atkins. "We saw other consumer portfolios declining at a lower rate, including Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, credit card and consumer lines and loans. On the commercial side, for the first time this year, we saw an increase in lending activity and line usage. Of the $55 billion decline in total loans year over year, $26 billion were in higher-risk, non-strategic portfolios that were in run-off mode," said Atkins.
Deposits
Average total core deposits were $761.8 billion compared with $759.2 billion in first quarter 2010 and $765.7 billion in second quarter 2009. Consumer checking accounts grew a net 7.4 percent from second quarter 2009. Average mortgage escrow deposits were $25.7 billion, compared with $24.6 billion in first quarter 2010. "We're very pleased with our success in attracting and retaining customer deposits and by the characteristics of our deposit base," said Atkins. "By the end of the quarter, core deposits fully funded the Company's loan portfolio. Average consumer checking and savings deposits increased 10 percent from a year ago to $672 billion. Year over year, CDs declined $63 billion, primarily the result of $57 billion of higher-cost Wachovia CDs maturing, yet total core deposits were down only $3.9 billion from a year ago. Checking and savings deposits represented 88 percent of total core deposits. Our average deposit cost was 35 basis points."
Capital
Capital ratios continued to increase in the second quarter reflecting strong internal capital generation. As a percentage of total risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital increased to 10.4 percent, total capital to 14.4 percent, Tier 1 leverage to 8.6 percent and Tier 1 common equity to 7.5 percent at June 30, 2010, up from 9.9 percent, 13.9 percent, 8.3 percent and 7.1 percent, respectively, at March 31, 2010. The Company repurchased $540 million of warrants from the U.S. Treasury during the quarter, which reduced the Tier 1 common ratio by approximately 5 basis points.

Credit Quality
"Last quarter we said we believed credit losses and provision expense had peaked," said Chief Credit and Risk Officer Mike Loughlin. "This quarter's significant reduction in credit losses confirmed our prior outlook and, in fact, we have seen credit quality improve earlier and to a greater extent than we had previously expected. Quarterly credit losses declined 16 percent to $4.49 billion in the second quarter from $5.33 billion in the first quarter. This improvement in losses was significant and broad based across the consumer portfolios, with reduced losses in the home equity, Wells Fargo Financial, Pick-a-Pay, consumer lines and loans, auto dealer services and credit card portfolios. Losses in the commercial portfolio continued to improve from the higher levels experienced last year, including a 10 percent linked-quarter reduction in commercial real estate losses. We also saw improvement in early indicators of credit quality, with improved 30 day delinquencies in many portfolios, including business direct, credit card, home equity, student lending and Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. Based on declining losses and across-the-board improved credit quality trends, the provision of $4.0 billion was $500 million less than net charge-offs in the second quarter. Absent significant deterioration in the economy, we currently expect future reductions in the allowance for loan losses.
"The continued improvement in credit performance is a result of a slowly improving economy coupled with actions taken by Wells Fargo over the past several years to improve underwriting standards and exit portfolios with unattractive credit metrics. We have seen the positive impact of these actions in the current quarter and in projected losses for future quarters."
Credit Losses
Second quarter net charge-offs were $4.5 billion, or 2.33 percent of average loans (annualized), down from first quarter net charge-offs of $5.3 billion, or 2.71 percent. Total credit losses included $1.3 billion of commercial and commercial real estate losses (1.80 percent), down $30 million from first quarter, and $3.1 billion of consumer losses (2.79 percent), down $817 million from first quarter, as shown in the following table.
Table of Contents
Net Loan Charge-Offs
 
Nonperforming Assets
Nonaccrual loans were $27.8 billion in the second quarter. Growth in nonaccrual loans slowed sharply, up only 2 percent from first quarter. The growth in second quarter occurred in the real estate portfolios (commercial and residential) which consist of secured loans. Nonaccruals in all other loan portfolios were essentially flat or down. New inflows to nonaccrual loans continued to decline (down 18 percent linked quarter). The amount of disposed nonaccruals increased (up 12 percent linked quarter), but was below the level of inflows. In part, it is taking longer to dispose of nonaccruals than in prior cycles because of federal government programs, such as , and Wells Fargo proprietary programs, such as the Company's Pick-a-Pay Mortgage Assistance program, which require customers to provide updated documentation and to complete trial repayment periods before the loan can be removed from nonaccrual status. In addition, for loans in foreclosure, many states, including California and Florida have enacted legislation that increases the time frames to complete the foreclosure process, meaning that loans will remain in nonaccrual status for longer periods even though the loans have already been written down. "At the conclusion of the foreclosure process, we continue to sell real estate owned in a very timely fashion," said Loughlin.
HAMP
"Loss expectations for nonaccrual loans are driven by delinquency rates, default probabilities and severities. While nonaccrual loans are not free of loss content, the loss exposure remaining in these balances is expected to be significantly mitigated by four factors. First, 98 percent of nonaccrual loans are secured. Second, losses have already been recognized on 39 percent of the consumer nonaccruals and 33 percent of commercial nonaccruals. Residential nonaccrual loans are written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due, except for loans that go into trial modification prior to going 180 days past due, which are not written down in the trial period (3 months). Third, as of June 30, 2010, 54 percent of
Table of Contents
commercial nonaccrual loans were current on interest. Fourth, there are certain nonaccruals for which there are loan level reserves in the allowance, while others are covered by general reserves."
Foreclosed assets were $5.0 billion at June 30, 2010, up $913 million from first quarter. Of this increase, $427 million were foreclosed loans in the PCI portfolio that are now recorded as foreclosed assets. "While foreclosed assets increased, the majority of the projected loss content in these assets has already been accounted for, or is insured by GNMA, and should have limited additional impact to expected loss levels," said Loughlin.
Nonaccrual Loans and Other Nonperforming Assets
 
Purchased Credit Impaired Loans
The improvement in credit quality was also evident in the PCI portfolio, which consists of loans acquired through the Wachovia merger that were deemed to have probable loss and therefore written down at acquisition. Overall, the PCI portfolio continued to perform in line with or better than originally expected. In particular, the Pick-a-Pay portfolio improved significantly, resulting in a $1.8 billion transfer from the nonaccretable difference to the accretable yield. This increase in accretable yield will be recognized as revenue over the remaining life of the loans, which is approximately eight years. "Our commercial PCI customers have been able to refinance and pay off loans due to increased market activity," said Loughlin.
Table of Contents
"Because of these payoffs and dispositions, we reduced the associated PCI nonaccretable difference in second quarter by $506 million, an amount reflected in income in the quarter."
Loans 90 Days or More Past Due and Still Accruing
Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing also improved in the quarter, totaling $19.4 billion at June 30, 2010, compared with $21.8 billion at March 31, 2010. For the same periods, the totals included $14.4 billion and $15.9 billion, respectively, in advances pursuant to the Company's servicing agreement to GNMA mortgage pools and similar loans whose repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Department of Veteran Affairs.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses, including the reserve for unfunded commitments, totaled $25.1 billion at June 30, 2010, down from $25.7 billion at March 31, 2010. The allowance coverage to total loans was 3.27 percent, flat compared with 3.28 percent at March 31, 2010. The allowance covered 1.4 times annualized second quarter net charge-offs compared with 1.2 times in the prior quarter. The allowance coverage to nonaccrual loans was 90 percent at June 30, 2010, compared with 94 percent at March 31, 2010. "We believe the allowance was adequate for losses inherent in the loan portfolio at June 30, 2010, and appropriately reflects the uncertainty around the impact of loan modification programs and economic recovery conditions," said Loughlin.

Selected Financial Information
Community Banking reported net income of $1.8 billion, down $325 million, or 16 percent, from prior year. Revenue decreased 10 percent year over year and 8 percent (annualized) linked quarter largely due to lower mortgage hedging results (lower carry income) and the planned reduction in certain liquidating loan portfolios. Noninterest expense decreased $211 million, or 3 percent, from prior year due to the FDIC special assessment in second quarter 2009 and Wachovia cost savings. The provision for credit losses decreased $946 million from second quarter 2009 on lower net charge-offs across consumer portfolios and improved credit quality metrics.

We make forward-looking statements when we use words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "should," "may," "can," "will," "outlook," "project," "appears" or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements in this news release include, among others, statements about: (i) future credit quality and expected or estimated future loan losses in our loan portfolios, including our belief that credit quality has turned the corner and quarterly provision expense and quarterly total credit losses have peaked, and that the positive trend in credit quality will continue over the coming year; the level and loss content of nonperforming assets and nonaccrual loans; and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, including our current expectation of future reductions in the allowance for loan losses; (ii) reduction or mitigation of risk in our loan portfolios and the effects of loan modification programs; and (iii) the amount and timing of expected integration activities, expenses and cost savings relating to the Wachovia merger, as well as the expected synergies and benefits of the merger, including that we currently estimate merger expenses of approximately $5.7 billion, including approximately $600-$650 million per quarter estimated for the second half of 2010 before declining in 2011.
Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements as actual results could differ materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and we do not undertake to update them to reflect changes or events that occur after that date. Several factors could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations including: current and future economic and market conditions, including the effects of further declines in housing prices and high unemployment rates; our capital requirements and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms (including, without limitation, regulatory capital standards as determined by applicable regulatory

authorities); the terms of capital investments or other financial assistance provided by the U.S. government; financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses (including, without limitation, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act); the extent of success in our loan modification efforts, including the effects of regulatory requirements, or changes in regulatory requirements, relating to loan modifications; our ability to successfully and timely integrate the Wachovia merger and realize the expected cost savings and other benefits, including delays or disruptions in system conversions and higher severance costs; our ability to realize efficiency initiatives to lower expenses when and in the amount expected; recognition of other-than-temporary impairment on securities held in our available-for-sale portfolio; the effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale; hedging gains or losses; disruptions in the capital markets and reduced investor demand for mortgage loans; our ability to sell more products to our customers; the effect of the economic recession on the demand for our products and services; the effect of fluctuations in stock market prices on fee income from our brokerage, asset and wealth management businesses; our election to provide support to our mutual funds for structured credit products they may hold; changes in the value of our venture capital investments; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards or in how accounting standards are to be applied; changes in our credit ratings and changes in the credit ratings of our customers or counterparties; mergers and acquisitions; federal and state regulations; reputational damage from negative publicity, fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations; the loss of checking and saving account deposits to other investments such as the stock market; and fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board. There is no assurance that our allowance for credit losses will be adequate to cover future credit losses, especially if credit markets, housing prices, and unemployment do not improve. Increases in loan charge-offs or in the allowance for credit losses and related provision expense could materially adversely affect our financial results and condition. For more information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, including the discussions under "Risk Factors" in each of those reports, as filed with the SEC and available on the SEC's website at .

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (PCI) LOANS
At the time of acquisition, certain loans acquired from Wachovia had evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it was considered probable that we would not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments (referred to as "purchased credit-impaired" (PCI) loans). Such loans are accounted for under ASC 310-30, (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 03-3, ). These accounting provisions require that acquired loans be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and prohibits carryover of the related allowance for loan losses. The difference between contractually required payments and cash flows expected to be collected is referred to as the nonaccretable difference and is used to absorb losses on PCI loans. We perform quarterly evaluations of cash flows and the loss content of our PCI loans. These evaluations may cause a reduction in the nonaccretable difference for lower loss estimates or an increase to our allowance for credit losses for increases in our loss estimates. The difference between the cash flows expected to be collected and the fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is accreted into interest income over the estimated life of the PCI loans using the effective yield method. See the "Changes in Nonaccretable Difference for PCI Loans" and "Changes in Accretable Yield Related to PCI Loans" for more discussion about the nonaccretable difference and accretable yield.
Receivables
Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer
At the time of acquisition, consumer PCI loans were aggregated and accounted for in discreet pools while commercial PCI loans were generally accounted for on an individual loan basis. From time to time individual loans are resolved by payment in full, foreclosure and liquidation of the underlying collateral or sale of the loan. For consumer PCI loans accounted for in pools, resolved loans are removed from the pool at the resolution amount received. The pool accretable yield is adjusted each quarter, as appropriate, for any material change in remaining effective yield caused by resolution removals and by other quarterly cash flow evaluation changes applicable to the pool. For resolved commercial PCI loans, the resolution income (the amount of nonaccretable difference not required to offset loss content) is recorded immediately as interest income if the loan is resolved directly with the borrower. Alternatively, resolution income is recorded immediately as noninterest income if the commercial PCI loan is resolved by sale to third parties. See the "Changes in Nonaccretable Difference for PCI Loans" for more discussion about the accounting for resolutions.
Because PCI loans were written down in purchase accounting to an amount estimated to be collectible, such loans are not classified as nonaccrual even though they may be contractually past due. Also, losses on such loans are charged against the nonaccretable difference established in purchase accounting and, as such, are not reported as charge-offs.
As a result of the application of ASC 310-30 to credit-impaired Wachovia loans, certain consolidated ratios cannot be used to compare a portfolio that includes PCI loans against one that does not, or to compare ratios across quarters or years. The ratios particularly affected include the allowance for loan losses and allowance for credit losses as percentages of loans, of nonaccrual loans and of nonperforming assets; nonaccrual loans and nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans; and net charge-offs as a percentage of loans.

CHANGES IN NONACCRETABLE DIFFERENCE FOR PCI LOANS
The nonaccretable difference was established in purchase accounting for PCI loans to absorb losses expected at that time on those loans. Amounts absorbed by the nonaccretable difference do not affect the income statement or the allowance for credit losses. The following table provides an analysis of changes in the nonaccretable difference related to principal that is not expected to be collected. Substantially all of our commercial, CRE and foreign PCI loans are accounted for as individual loans. Conversely, Pick-a-Pay and other consumer PCI loans have been aggregated into several pools based on common risk characteristics. Each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. Resolutions of loans may include sales of loans to third parties, receipt of payments in full or in part from the borrower, or foreclosure and liquidation of the collateral. Our policy is to remove an individual loan from a pool based on comparing the amount received from its resolution with its contractual amount. Any difference between these amounts is absorbed by the nonaccretable difference. This removal method assumes that the amount received from resolution approximates original pool performance expectations at the time of acquisition. The remaining accretable yield balance is unaffected and any material change in remaining effective yield caused by this removal method is addressed by our quarterly cash flow evaluation process for each pool. For loans in pools that are resolved by payment in full, there is no release of the nonaccretable difference since there is no difference between the amount received at resolution and the contractual amount of the loan.

CHANGES IN ACCRETABLE YIELD RELATED TO PCI LOANS
The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the initial fair value of PCI loans is referred to as the accretable yield and is accreted into interest income over the estimated life of the PCI loans using the effective yield method. The accretable yield and resulting effective yield will change due to:
For PCI loans, the impact of loan modifications is included in the evaluation of expected cash flows for subsequent decreases or increases of cash flows. For variable rate PCI loans, expected future cash flows will be recalculated as the rates adjust over the lives of the loans. At acquisition, the expected future cash flows were based on the variable rates that were in effect at that time. The change in the accretable yield related to PCI loans is presented in the following table.
 
 
CHANGES IN ALLOWANCE FOR PCI LOAN LOSSES
When it is estimated that the expected cash flows have decreased subsequent to acquisition for a PCI loan or pool of loans, an allowance is established and a provision for additional loss is recorded as a charge to income. The following table summarizes the changes in allowance for PCI loan losses.
