Selected Financial Information
SAN FRANCISCO  Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC) reported diluted earnings per common share of $0.60 for third quarter 2010 compared with $0.55 for second quarter 2010 and $0.56 for third quarter 2009. Net income was $3.34 billion in third quarter 2010 compared with $3.06 billion in second quarter 2010 and $3.24 billion in third quarter 2009. For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, net income was $8.95 billion, or $1.60 per common share, compared with $9.45 billion, or $1.69 per common share, a year ago.
"Record earnings in the third quarter reflect the success of the Wachovia merger and the benefits of Wells Fargo's steady commitment to our core business of helping customers succeed financially," said Chairman and CEO John Stumpf. "We have already completed integration of many systems and lines of business, and converted banking stores in the first Eastern markets  Alabama, Tennessee and Mississippi  to Wells Fargo in September, with virtually no customer or systems issues. The foundation is solidly in place to continue conversions in the East this year and throughout 2011. While we are focused on the remaining work ahead, our results have shown that this landmark merger is a big success in terms of cost savings, revenue synergies and the quality of the integration. Throughout the conversion process, the team has kept systems and service top notch for customers.
"With respect to recent industry-wide foreclosure issues, there are several important facts to know about Wells Fargo. Foreclosure is always a last resort, and we work hard to find other solutions through multiple discussions with customers over many months before proceeding to foreclosure. We are confident that our practices, procedures and documentation for both foreclosures and mortgage securitizations are sound and accurate. For these reasons, we did not, and have no plans to, initiate a moratorium on foreclosures.
 
"As the regulatory environment becomes more certain and as we continue to assess the impact of regulatory reform and new capital requirements, we remain convinced that Wells Fargo will continue to be a leader in financial strength and performance in the years ahead. We continue to deepen relationships and add new customers, as evidenced by increases in loan commitments in several loan portfolios and growth in checking accounts. Our team is focused on doing the right thing for our customers and doing everything in our power to further the economic recovery."
"In the third quarter, we earned $3.34 billion in net income, our highest quarterly profit ever," said Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins. "Earnings and growth were broad based, with all business segments contributing to our record net income. Deposit growth continued to be strong, especially in average checking and savings deposits, which increased 9 percent from a year ago and 9 percent (annualized) linked quarter. The Company supplied $176 billion in credit to consumers and businesses, up from both the prior quarter and a year ago, reflecting strong mortgage origination activity and increased commercial lending activity. A substantial amount of the decline in loans outstanding was in previously disclosed non-strategic, liquidating portfolios. We saw signs of increased lending activity in several portfolios, with higher loan balances linked quarter in asset-backed finance, auto dealer services, capital finance, private student lending, SBA lending, specialized lending, wealth management consumer, and wholesale commercial banking and commercial real estate. Credit losses continued to trend down, with net charge-offs declining 9 percent linked quarter, and down $1.3 billion, or 24 percent, from the peak in fourth quarter 2009.
Financial Performance
"The merger with Wachovia is already proving to be a big success. Wells Fargo has earned cumulative profits of $21.2 billion since January 2009. The merger of these two companies has met or exceeded our expectations in terms of lower credit losses, more abundant revenue synergies and integration savings. Through strong internal capital generation, our capital ratios have increased rapidly and are well above pre-Wachovia levels, with Tier 1 common reaching 8.0 percent and Tier 1 capital increasing to 10.9 percent. While Basel III regulations are still not final, we expect to be above a 7 percent Tier 1 common ratio under the proposed rules, as we currently understand them, within the next few quarters."
Revenue was $20.9 billion compared with $21.4 billion in second quarter 2010 and $22.5 billion in third quarter 2009. The $520 million decline in total revenue linked quarter was due to three factors totaling $985 million: net debt and equity security gains (down $301 million from second quarter), PCI loan resolution income (down $304 million from second quarter) and the impact from changes to Regulation E and related overdraft policy changes (approximately $380 million pre tax). All other business operations generated combined revenue growth of approximately $465 million. Businesses with double-digit annualized revenue growth linked quarter included asset-backed finance, asset management, auto dealer

services, brokerage, commercial banking, commercial mortgage servicing, commercial real estate, debit card, mortgage banking, private student lending, real estate investment banking (Eastdil Secured) and retirement services.
Net interest income was $11.1 billion compared with $11.4 billion in second quarter 2010 and $11.7 billion in third quarter 2009. The net interest margin was 4.25 percent compared with 4.38 percent in second quarter 2010 and 4.36 percent in third quarter 2009. "The 13 basis point decline in the margin was largely driven by lower PCI resolution income and the continued run-off of non-strategic assets, which tend to have higher yields but also higher charge-offs than loans in our ongoing strategic portfolios," said Atkins.
Net Interest Income
Noninterest income was $9.8 billion compared with $9.9 billion in second quarter and $10.8 billion a year ago. On a linked-quarter basis, growth in mortgage banking noninterest income (up $488 million on a 25 percent increase in mortgage originations) and trading revenue (up $361 million, driven by a less volatile trading environment than second quarter) was offset by reductions in deposit service charges (down $285 million, with an approximate $380 million impact from changes to Regulation E and related overdraft policy changes, offset by checking account growth), a $301 million reduction in net debt and equity security gains from second quarter, and a $147 million reduction in insurance fee revenue (due to seasonality and largely offset by reduction in related insurance sales expense).
Noninterest Income
Mortgage banking saw the second highest quarter ever in mortgage applications  $194 billion, up from $143 billion in second quarter. At quarter end, the mortgage application pipeline was $101 billion, up $33 billion from June 30, 2010, suggesting strong originations in fourth quarter. Third quarter originations were $101 billion, up 25 percent from second quarter. Mortgage servicing income declined $702 million from second quarter, given greater reliance on the Company's "natural business hedge" in the strong origination, low-rate environment relative to the level of MSR economic hedges, and lower hedge carry income. Net hedge results reflected a $1.1 billion decline in the fair value of MSRs due to the decline in mortgage rates offset by a $1.2 billion increase in the value of the hedge including carry income. The ratio of MSRs as a percent of loans serviced for others was 72 basis points  one of the lowest in the Company's history  and the average note rate on the servicing portfolio was 5.46 percent, compared with an average 4.32 percent published rate in the Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey at quarter-end.
During the quarter, the Company provided $370 million for mortgage loan repurchase losses compared with $382 million in second quarter (included in revenue from mortgage loan origination/sales activities). The lower provision this quarter reflected a decline in demands from agencies on the 2006-2008 vintages and lower total outstanding demands as the Company continues to work with investors to resolve the outstanding demand pipeline.
 
At September 30, 2010, the Company had a net unrealized gain of $9.4 billion in the securities available-for-sale portfolio, compared with $8.6 billion at the end of second quarter.
Noninterest expense was $12.3 billion, down $493 million, or 15 percent (annualized), from second quarter 2010 largely due to a reduction in Wells Fargo Financial restructuring expenses and lower litigation accruals. Foreclosed asset expense was up $33 million linked quarter and $123 million year over year. "We continue to invest for long-term growth, including adding sales personnel and distribution, while at the same time reducing all other costs," said Atkins. "Our current expense base is elevated by integration and workout costs, which should decline over time. In addition, we are looking at other ways to reduce cost by simplifying and streamlining our activities and processes throughout the Company." The efficiency ratio was 58.7 percent compared with 59.6 percent in second quarter 2010 and 52.0 percent in third quarter 2009.
Noninterest Expense
Total loans were $753.7 billion at September 30, 2010 compared with $766.3 billion at June 30, 2010 and $800.0 billion at September 30, 2009, reflecting a continuation of more subdued loan demand. The decline in loans from the prior quarter was partially due to the $6.2 billion reduction in non-strategic/liquidating loan portfolios. "We saw linked-quarter loan growth in asset-backed finance, auto dealer services, capital finance, private student lending, specialized lending, SBA lending, wealth management consumer and wholesale commercial banking and commercial real estate," said Atkins. "While other consumer portfolios declined, the reduction was at a slower pace, including in the credit card, personal credit management and Wells Fargo Home Mortgage portfolios. Origination activity increased in wholesale and commercial real estate portfolios."
Loans
Average total core deposits were $772.0 billion, up 5 percent (annualized) from $761.8 billion in second quarter 2010 and up 2 percent from $759.3 billion in third quarter 2009. Consumer checking accounts grew a net 7.3 percent from third quarter 2009. Average mortgage escrow deposits were $30.2 billion, compared with $25.7 billion in second quarter 2010. Average consumer checking and savings deposits increased 9 percent from a year ago to $686.9 billion. Total core deposits were up $23.9 billion from a year ago despite the $37.6 billion year over year decline in CDs, including approximately $21 billion of higher-cost Wachovia CDs that matured. Checking and savings deposits represented 89 percent of total core deposits. The average deposit cost was 35 basis points.
Deposits
 
Strong internal capital generation drove capital ratios higher in the third quarter. As a percentage of total risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital increased to 10.9 percent, total capital to 14.9 percent and Tier 1 common equity to 8.0 percent at September 30, 2010, up from 10.6 percent, 14.7 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively, at September 30, 2009. The Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.0 percent at September 30, 2010, flat compared with September 30, 2009.
Capital
"Loan losses declined for the third consecutive quarter," said Mike Loughlin, Chief Risk Officer. "Quarterly net charge-offs of $4.1 billion were down $394 million, or 9 percent, from second quarter and down $1.3 billion from the peak in fourth quarter 2009. Losses were down or relatively flat in the vast majority of loan portfolios, with losses in commercial loans (down 26 percent), commercial real estate mortgage loans (down 39 percent), credit cards (down 13 percent), and real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgages (down 8 percent) showing encouraging declines. The improvement in credit quality was also evident in the purchased credit-impaired (PCI) portfolio, which consists of loans acquired through the Wachovia merger that were deemed to have probable loss and therefore written down at acquisition. Overall, the PCI portfolio continued to perform in line with or better than originally expected.
Credit Quality
"Nonperforming loans increased moderately, with a majority of the increase in the commercial loan portfolio. Nonperforming consumer loans were stable to improved. We expect nonperforming assets to remain elevated as we manage through the economic cycle. The provision for loan losses was $650 million less than net charge-offs, reflecting improved portfolio performance. Absent significant deterioration in the economy, we currently expect future reductions in the allowance for loan losses."
Third quarter net charge-offs were $4.1 billion, or 2.14 percent (annualized) of average loans, down from second quarter net charge-offs of $4.5 billion (2.33 percent). Third quarter losses were down $1 billion, or 20 percent, from third quarter 2009 (as shown on page 37 of the financial tables). Total net credit losses included $1 billion of commercial and commercial real estate losses (1.42 percent), down $288 million from second quarter, and $3.0 billion of consumer losses (2.72 percent), down $103 million from second quarter, as shown in the following table.

Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets increased as expected, ending the quarter at $34.6 billion. Growth in nonaccrual loans continued to be slight, up 2 percent from second quarter, to $28.3 billion. The growth in third quarter nonaccruals occurred primarily in commercial loans, while nonaccruals in consumer and consumer real estate loan portfolios were essentially flat or down.
Commercial and commercial real estate nonperforming loans were up approximately $400 million from the second quarter. "We continue to manage the portfolio aggressively and assist our borrowers as they navigate through this challenging credit environment," said Loughlin. "We place loans on nonaccrual when appropriate, continue to monitor these credits closely and take appropriate action as necessary. Measurable loss on nonaccrual loans has already been taken and we believe adequate collateral and reserves are in place to mitigate further loss events."
While nonaccrual loans are not free of loss content, the loss exposure remaining in these balances is expected to be significantly mitigated by four factors. First, 99 percent of consumer nonaccrual loans and 96 percent of commercial nonaccruals are secured. Second, losses have already been recognized on 40 percent of the consumer nonaccruals and commercial nonaccruals have been written down by $2.9 billion. Residential nonaccrual loans are generally written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Third, as of September 30, 2010, 58 percent of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on interest. Fourth, the inherent risk of loss in all nonaccruals is adequately covered by the allowance for loan losses.
 
Foreclosed assets were $6.1 billion at September 30, 2010, up $1.1 billion from second quarter of which $509 million was due to transfers from PCI portfolios, and $148 million from an increase in fully insured GNMA loans. Non-GNMA foreclosed assets increased as more distressed loans reached the final stage of the resolution process. Over 44 percent of the increase came from the commercial PCI and Pick-a-Pay portfolios as the impaired loans in these segments reach final dispositions. "Given the current levels of nonaccruing loans, we would expect a higher than normal inflow into foreclosed assets over the near term as we resolve these loans," said Loughlin. "The outflow should continue to increase as we liquidate the assets over time. While total foreclosed assets increased, the majority of the projected loss content in these assets has already been accounted for, or are government insured, and should have limited additional impact to expected loss levels."
Nonaccrual Loans and Other Nonperforming Assets
     
 
Loans 90 Days or More Past Due and Still Accruing
Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing also improved in the quarter, totaling $18.8 billion at September 30, 2010, compared with $19.4 billion at June 30, 2010. For the same periods, the totals included $14.5 billion and $14.4 billion, respectively, in advances pursuant to the Company's servicing agreement to GNMA mortgage pools and similar loans whose repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Commercial and
 
commercial real estate loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing improved significantly, down $648 million, or 39 percent, from the prior quarter.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses, including the reserve for unfunded commitments, totaled $24.4 billion at September 30, 2010, down from $25.1 billion at June 30, 2010. The allowance coverage to total loans was 3.23 percent, essentially flat compared with 3.27 percent at June 30, 2010. The allowance covered 1.5 times annualized third quarter net charge-offs compared with 1.4 times in the prior quarter. The allowance coverage to nonaccrual loans was 86 percent at September 30, 2010, compared with 90 percent at June 30, 2010. "We believe the allowance was adequate for losses inherent in the loan portfolio at September 30, 2010, and continues to reflect prudent acknowledgement of uncertainty in the economic environment," said Loughlin.

Community Banking
offers a complete line of diversified financial products and services for consumers and small businesses including investment, insurance and trust services in 39 states and D.C., and mortgage and home equity loans in all 50 states and D.C.
Selected Financial Information
Community Banking reported net income of $2 billion, up $236 million, or 13 percent, from second quarter 2010. Revenue decreased $140 million, or 1 percent, driven primarily by lower deposit service charges due to changes to Regulation E and the planned reduction in certain liquidating loan portfolios, mitigated by an increase in mortgage banking income, as higher originations/sales activities more than offset lower servicing income (decline in mortgage rates). Noninterest expense decreased $355 million, or 5 percent, driven primarily by lower litigation expense as well as severance costs associated with the restructuring of Wells Fargo Financial in the prior quarter. Average loans of $527 billion decreased 2 percent and average core deposits of $536 billion grew 0.4 percent. The provision for credit losses decreased $192 million primarily due to lower net charge-offs.
Community Banking reported net income of $2 billion, down $734 million, or 27 percent from prior year.

Noninterest expense increased $322 million, or 5 percent, from prior year due primarily to higher litigation expense. The provision for credit losses decreased $1.5 billion from third quarter 2009 on lower net charge-offs across consumer portfolios and improved credit quality metrics.

In accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we caution you that this news release contains forward-looking statements about our future financial performance and business. We make forward-looking statements when we use words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "should," "may," "can," "will," "outlook," "project," "appears" or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements in this news release include, among others, statements about: (i) future credit quality and expected or estimated future loan losses in our loan portfolios; the level and loss content of nonperforming assets and nonaccrual loans, as well as the level of inflows and outflows into nonperforming assets; and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, including our current expectation of future reductions in the allowance for loan losses; (ii) reduction or mitigation of risk in our loan portfolios; (iii) our expectation that we will be at a 7 percent Tier 1 common ratio under proposed Basel III capital regulations within the next few quarters; (iv) our foreclosure practices and related matters; and (v) the amount and timing of expected integration activities, expenses and cost savings relating to the Wachovia merger, as well as the expected synergies and benefits of the merger.
Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements as actual results could differ materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and we do not undertake to update them to reflect changes or events that occur after that date. Several factors could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations including: current and future economic and market conditions, including the effects of further declines in housing prices and high unemployment rates; our capital requirements and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms (including, without limitation, regulatory capital standards as determined by applicable regulatory authorities); financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses (including, without limitation, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act); the extent of success in our loan modification efforts, including the effects of regulatory requirements, or changes in regulatory requirements, relating to loan
 
modifications; the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands from third parties; our ability to successfully and timely integrate the Wachovia merger and realize the expected cost savings and other benefits, including delays or disruptions in system conversions and higher severance costs; our ability to realize efficiency initiatives to lower expenses when and in the amount expected; recognition of other-than-temporary impairment on securities held in our available-for-sale portfolio; the effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale; hedging gains or losses; disruptions in the capital markets and reduced investor demand for mortgage loans; our ability to sell more products to our customers; the effect of the economic recession on the demand for our products and services; the effect of fluctuations in stock market prices on fee income from our brokerage, asset and wealth management businesses; our election to provide support to our mutual funds for structured credit products they may hold; changes in the value of our venture capital investments; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards or in how accounting standards are to be applied; changes in our credit ratings and changes in the credit ratings of our customers or counterparties; mergers and acquisitions; federal and state regulations; reputational damage from negative publicity, fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations; the loss of checking and saving account deposits to other investments such as the stock market; and fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board. There is no assurance that our allowance for credit losses will be adequate to cover future credit losses, especially if credit markets, housing prices, and unemployment do not improve. Increases in loan charge-offs or in the allowance for credit losses and related provision expense could materially adversely affect our financial results and condition. For more information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2010, and June 30, 2010, including the discussions under "Risk Factors" in each of those reports, as filed with the SEC and available on the SEC's website at .

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (PCI) LOANS
Loans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected are considered to be credit impaired. PCI loans represent loans acquired from Wachovia that were deemed to be credit impaired. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include statistics such as past due and nonaccrual status, recent borrower credit scores and recent LTV percentages. PCI loans are initially measured at fair value, which includes estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan. Accordingly, the associated allowance for credit losses related to these loans is not carried over at the acquisition date.
Under the accounting guidance for PCI loans, the excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans, in situations where there is a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected. Accordingly, such loans are not classified as nonaccrual and they are considered to be accruing because their interest income relates to the accretable yield recognized under accounting for PCI loans and not to contractual interest payments. The difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference.
In addition, subsequent to acquisition, we are required to periodically evaluate our estimate of cash flows expected to be collected. These evaluations, performed quarterly, require the continued usage of key assumptions and estimates, similar to the initial estimate of fair value. Decreases in the expected cash flows will generally result in a charge to the provision for credit losses resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. Increases in the expected cash flows will generally result in an increase in interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans.
As a result of PCI loan accounting, certain credit-related ratios cannot be used to compare a portfolio that includes PCI loans against one that does not, or to compare ratios across quarters or years. The ratios particularly affected include the allowance for loan losses and allowance for credit losses as percentages of loans, of nonaccrual loans and of nonperforming assets; nonaccrual loans and nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans; and net charge-offs as a percentage of loans.

CHANGES IN NONACCRETABLE DIFFERENCE FOR PCI LOANS
A nonaccretable difference was established in purchase accounting for PCI loans to absorb losses expected at that time on those loans. Amounts absorbed by the nonaccretable difference do not affect the income statement or the allowance for credit losses. Substantially all our commercial, CRE and foreign PCI loans are accounted for as individual loans. Conversely, Pick-a-Pay and other consumer PCI loans have been aggregated into several pools based on common risk characteristics. Each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. Resolutions of loans may include sales of loans to third parties, receipt of payments in settlement with the borrower, or foreclosure of the collateral. Our policy is to remove an individual loan from a pool based on comparing the amount received from its resolution with its contractual amount. Any difference between these amounts is absorbed by the nonaccretable difference. This removal method assumes that the amount received from resolution approximates pool performance expectations. The remaining accretable yield balance is unaffected and any material change in remaining effective yield caused by this removal method is addressed by our quarterly cash flow evaluation process for each pool. For loans in pools that are resolved by payment in full, there is no release of the nonaccretable difference since there is no difference between the amount received at resolution and the contractual amount of the loan. The following table provides an analysis of changes in the nonaccretable difference related to principal that is not expected to be collected.

CHANGES IN ACCRETABLE YIELD RELATED TO PCI LOANS
The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the initial fair value of PCI loans is referred to as the accretable yield and is accreted into interest income over the estimated life of the PCI loans using the effective yield method. The accretable yield is affected by:
The change in the accretable yield related to PCI loans is presented in the following table.
 
CHANGES IN ALLOWANCE FOR PCI LOAN LOSSES
When it is estimated that the expected cash flows have decreased subsequent to acquisition for a PCI loan or pool of loans, an allowance is established and a provision for additional loss is recorded as a charge to income. The following table summarizes the changes in allowance for PCI loan losses.

CHANGES IN LIABILITY FOR MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE LOSSES
 
OUTSTANDING REPURCHASE DEMANDS AND MORTGAGE INSURANCE RESCISSIONS
While original loan balance related to these demands is presented below, the establishment of the repurchase reserve is based on a combination of factors, such as our appeals success rates, reimbursement by correspondent and other third party originators, and projected loss severity, which is driven by the difference between the current loan balance and the estimated collateral value less costs to sell the property.
