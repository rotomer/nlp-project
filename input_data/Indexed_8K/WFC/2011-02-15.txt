Exhibit 5.1
Wells Fargo & Company
420 Montgomery Street
San Francisco, California 94163
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel for Wells Fargo & Company (the "Company") in connection with the preparation of a Registration Statement on Form S-3, File No. 333-159736 (the "Registration Statement"), of the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to the proposed offer and sale from time to time of the securities referred to therein, the Prospectus Supplement dated February 10, 2011 relating to the offer and sale by the Selling Securityholders named therein under the Registration Statement of $2,501,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes due 2016. The Notes are to be issued under the Indenture dated as of July 21, 1999 (the "Indenture") entered into by the Company and Citibank, N.A., as trustee.
We have examined such documents, records, and instruments as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Notes have been duly authorized and, when duly executed by the Company and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Notes will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance, receivership or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and subject to general equity principles including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith, fair dealing and the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and except further as enforcement thereof may be limited by any governmental authority that limits, delays or prohibits the making of payments outside of the United States. As contemplated by the foregoing qualifications, in rendering the foregoing opinion, we are expressing no opinion as to Federal or state laws relating to fraudulent transfers. The foregoing opinion assumes that the Company has received the consideration for the Notes specified in the corporate proceeding of the Company authorizing the issuance of the Notes.
We have relied as to certain relevant facts upon certificates of, and/or information provided by, officers and employees of the Company as to the accuracy of such factual matters without

independent verification thereof or other investigation. We have also relied, without investigation, upon the following assumptions: (i) natural persons acting on behalf of the Company have sufficient legal capacity to enter into and perform, on behalf of the Company, the transaction in question; (ii) each party to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreements or instruments enforceable against it; (iii) each party to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company has complied with all legal requirements pertaining to its status as such status relates to its rights to enforce such agreements or instruments against the Company; and (iv) each document submitted to us for review is accurate and complete, each such document that is an original is authentic, each such document that is a copy conforms to an authentic original, and all signatures on each such document are genuine.
The opinions expressed herein are limited to the specific issues addressed and to documents and laws existing on the date hereof. By rendering our opinion, we do not undertake to advise you with respect to any other matter or of any change in such documents and laws or in the interpretation thereof which may occur after the date hereof.
Our opinions set forth herein are limited to the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United States of America and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company filed with the Commission and thereby incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act.

(d) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 under the Act), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, including in connection with use or delivery of the Final Prospectus, the Company will promptly notify the Selling Securityholder and will, upon the Selling Shareholder's request, prepare and file with the Commission an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance. Neither the Selling Securityholder's request for, nor the Selling Securityholder's delivery of, any such amendment or supplement shall constitute a waiver of any of the conditions set forth in Section 3 hereof.
(e) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11 (a) of the Act.
(f) The Company will furnish to the Selling Securityholder and counsel for the Selling Securityholder, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and each amendment thereto which shall become effective on or prior to the Resale Closing Date and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Selling Securityholder or dealer may be required by the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 under the Act), as many copies of any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus included in the Disclosure Package and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto as the Selling Securityholder may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering and the expenses incurred in distributing the Final Prospectus to the Selling Securityholder.
(g) The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Selling Securityholder may designate and will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required to complete the distribution of the Securities; that the Company shall not be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject or subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
provided, however, 
(h) Until the business day following the Resale Closing Date or such earlier time as you may notify the Company, the Company will not, without the consent of the Selling Securityholder, offer or sell, or announce the offering of, any debt securities that are substantially similar to the Securities (other than commercial paper) and are covered by the Registration Statement or any other registration statement filed under the Act.
 
(i) The Company agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Selling Securityholder, and the Selling Securityholder agrees with the Company that, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a Free Writing Prospectus required to be filed with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433 under the Act; that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectus included in Schedule I hereto. Any such Free Writing Prospectus consented to by the Selling Securityholder or the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "." The Company agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 under the Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.
provided
Permitted Free Writing Prospectus
(j) The Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, for any filing fees or other expenses in connection with qualification of the Securities for sale and determination of their eligibility for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Selling Securityholder may designate and the printing of memoranda relating thereto, for any fees charged by investment rating agencies for the rating of the Securities, for any travel expenses of the Company's officers and employees and any other expenses of the Company in connection with attending or hosting meetings with prospective purchasers of Securities and for expenses incurred in distributing any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule I hereto or the Final Prospectus.

(b) (i) The Company shall have furnished to the Selling Securityholder the opinion of Mary E. Schaffner, Senior Company Counsel of the Company, dated the Resale Closing Date, to the effect that:
(A) no consent, approval, authorization or order of any court or government agency or body is required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such as may be required under the Blue Sky laws of any jurisdiction or FINRA regulations in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Selling Securityholder;
 
(B) the number and type of equity securities the Company is authorized to issue is as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus;

(E) the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended;
(F) the statements in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (other than statements furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Selling Securityholder, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by the Selling Securityholder consists of such information described as such in the Blood Letter) under the captions "Plan of Distribution" and "Description of the Notes" insofar as they purport to summarize certain provisions of documents or laws specifically referred to therein, are accurate summaries of such provisions or laws or of the sources from which such summaries were derived; and
(G) such counsel has no reason to believe that any part of the Registration Statement, as of its effective date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Final Prospectus, as of the date of the Public Offer Notice and as of the Resale Closing Date, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
 
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that the Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (in each case and to the extent applicable, other than the Statements of Eligibility on Form T-1, the financial statements and related notes and other financial and financial reserve information and statistical and accounting data contained therein and the statements furnished in writing to the Company by the Selling Securityholder, as to which such counsel need express no opinion).

provided,
 
(e) As of the Resale Closing Date there shall not have occurred since the date of the Public Offer Notice any change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business, properties, results of operations or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from that set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of the date of the Public Offer Notice, that, in the judgment of the Selling Securityholder, is material and adverse and that makes it, in the judgment of the Selling Securityholder, impracticable to market or sell the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus, as so amended or supplemented.
4. If the resale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Selling Securityholder set forth in Section 3 hereof is not satisfied or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof, the Company will reimburse the Selling Securityholder upon demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and those described in Section 2(j) hereof) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed resale of the Securities.
Reimbursement of Selling Securityholder's Expenses.
5.
Indemnification and Contribution.
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Selling Securityholder and each person who controls the Selling Securityholder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party to the extent set forth below, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Selling Securityholder specifically for use therein (it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by the Selling Securityholder consists of such information described as such in the Blood Letter). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided, however, 
(b) The Selling Securityholder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Selling Securityholder, but only with reference to written information relating to the Selling Securityholder furnished to the Company by the Selling Securityholder for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity (it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by the Selling Securityholder consists of such information described as such in the Blood Letter). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Selling Securityholder may otherwise have.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 5 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental investigation), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under clause (a) or (b) of this Section 5, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under clause (a) or (b) of this Section 5. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it shall wish, jointly, with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party). In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to obtain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts of interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate identified firm (in addition to any identified local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Selling Securityholder in the case of parties to be indemnified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 5 and by the Company in the case of parties to be indemnified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 5. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its prior written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of the indemnified party.
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 5(a) or 5(b) hereof is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Selling Securityholder, on the other hand, from the offering of such Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Selling Securityholder, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Selling Securityholder, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information
 
supplied by the Company or by such Selling Securityholder and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), the Selling Securityholder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the difference between the aggregate proceeds from the sale of the Securities sold by it and the purchase price paid by such Selling Securityholder for the Junior Subordinated Notes tendered in exchange for such Securities in accordance with Section 1 of the Agreement.
(e) The Company and the Selling Securityholder agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to Section 5(d) hereof were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 5(d) hereof. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 5(d) hereof shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, the Selling Securityholder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities referred to in Section 5(d) hereof that were offered and sold to the public through the Selling Securityholder exceeds the amount of any damages that the Selling Securityholder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11 (f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
pro rata 
6. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Selling Securityholder set forth in or made pursuant to this Annex A will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Selling Securityholder or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 5 hereof, and will survive the resale of the Securities. The provisions of Sections 4 and 5 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Annex.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive. 
7. This Annex will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 5 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.

Selling Securityholder Representations and Agreements
In the event that the offer or sale of the Securities by the Selling Securityholder in a jurisdiction requires any action on the part of the Company in or with respect to such jurisdiction, the Selling Securityholder represents and agrees that it will (i) inform the Company that the Company is required to take such action prior to the time such action is required to be taken, and (ii) cooperate with and assist the Company in complying with such requirements.

offering material relating to the Securities, and will obtain any required consent, approval or permission for its purchase, offer, sale or delivery of the Securities under the laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which it is subject or in which it makes any such purchases, offers, sales or deliveries. In particular, each Selling Securityholder acknowledges, represents and agrees as set forth in the tenth through sixteenth paragraphs inclusive of the section entitled "Plan of Distribution" beginning on page S-10 of the Final Prospectus.
Each Selling Securityholder severally agrees that it will timely file with the Corporate Financing Department of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (the "Association") any documents required to be filed under Rules 5110 and 5121 of the Association's Conduct Rules relating to the offering of the Securities.
