The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business (5:00 p.m. New York City time) on the Regular Record Date for such interest (whether or not a Business Day, as defined below) next preceding such Interest Payment Date. The Regular Record Date for an Interest Payment Date shall be the fifteenth calendar day, whether or not a Business Day, prior to such Interest Payment Date.
Company
            
            
Stated Maturity Date
Any interest not punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Security not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which this Security may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.
Payment of interest on this Security will be made in immediately available funds at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the City of Minneapolis, Minnesota in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that, at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be paid by check mailed to the Person entitled thereto at such Person's last address as it appears in the Security Register or by wire transfer to such account as may have been designated by such Person. Payment of principal of and interest on this Security at Maturity will be made against presentation of this Security at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the City of Minneapolis, Minnesota or at any other office or agency maintained by the Company for such purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for so long as this Security is a Global Security registered in the name of the Depositary, payments of principal and interest on this Security will be made to the Depositary by wire transfer of immediately available funds.
Exchange Right
Beginning March 12, 2011 to and including the earlier of (i) the Trading Day prior to the Redemption Notice Date, if applicable, and (ii) the fifth Trading Day prior to the Stated Maturity Date, the Holder of this Security may exchange each $1,000 principal amount of this Security for a number of shares of each Basket Stock (as defined below) equal to its Exchange Ratio (as defined below) (or, at the Company's option, the cash value of such shares as determined on the Exchange Notice Date (as defined below)), subject to the Company's right to redeem this Security on any day from and including March 2, 2014. A "" is a day on which the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Markets and the American Stock Exchange, or any successor thereto, are open for trading during their regular trading sessions. This right of the Holder of this Security to exchange this Security is referred to herein as the "."
Trading Day
Exchange Right
The "" for each Basket Stock is set forth below in the definition of "Basket Stocks" under "Certain Definitions" and is a number of shares calculated so that each Basket Stock initially represents its proportion of the initial Basket Value (as defined below) based on the initial stock prices of the Basket Stocks used to calculate the Exchange Ratios of the Basket Stocks. The initial stock price of each Basket Stock was determined on February 23, 2011. The Exchange Ratio for each Basket Stock will remain constant for the term of this Security unless adjusted for certain corporate events relating to, or dividend payments by, the issuer of that Basket Stock. See "  Adjustment Events" below.
Exchange Ratio
 
When the Holder of this Security exchanges this Security or any portion hereof, the Calculation Agent will determine the exact number of shares of each of the Basket Stocks to be received by the Holder based on the principal amount of this Security exchanged and the Exchange Ratio of each Basket Stock as it may have been adjusted through the Exchange Notice Date. Since this Security will be held only in book-entry form, a beneficial owner of this Security may exercise the Exchange Right only by acting through its participant at DTC, whose nominee is the registered Holder of this Security. Accordingly, if a beneficial owner of this Security desires to exchange all or any portion of this Security, such beneficial owner must instruct the participant through which it owns its interest to exercise the Exchange Right on its behalf.
To exchange this Security or any portion hereof on any day, a beneficial owner of this Security or any portion hereof must instruct its broker or other person with whom it holds its beneficial interest to take the appropriate steps through normal clearing system channels. A beneficial owner's book-entry interest in this Security must be transferred to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., the Paying Agent, on the day the Company delivers shares or pays cash to the Holder hereof, as described below. In addition, a beneficial owner of this Security must give the Company notice of exchange as follows:
 
 
In order to ensure that the instructions are received by the Company on a particular day, a beneficial owner of this Security must instruct the participant through which it owns its interest before that participant's deadline for accepting instructions from their customers. Different firms may have different deadlines for accepting instructions from their customers. Accordingly, a beneficial owner of this Security should consult the participant through which it owns its interest for the relevant deadline. If the Company receives an Official Notice of Exchange after 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on any day or at any time on a day when the stock markets are closed, such notice will not become effective until the next day that the stock markets are open. All instructions given to the Company by participants on behalf of a beneficial owner relating to the right to exchange this Security will be irrevocable. In addition, at the time instructions are given, a beneficial owner of this Security must direct the participant through which it owns its interest to transfer its book-entry interest in this Security, on DTC's records, to the Paying Agent on the Company's behalf.
This Security must be exchanged in $1,000 minimum increments at a time.
The Holder of this Security will no longer have the Exchange Right if the Company redeems this Security.
Upon any exercise of the Exchange Right, the Holder of this Security will not be entitled to receive any cash payment representing any accrued but unpaid interest. Consequently, if this Security or any portion hereof is exchanged so that the Exchange Settlement Date (as defined below) occurs during the period from the close of business on a Regular Record Date for the
 
payment of interest and prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, this Security or the portion hereof exchanged must, as a condition to the delivery of the shares of the Basket Stocks or cash to the Holder hereof, be accompanied by funds equal to the interest payable on the succeeding Interest Payment Date on the principal amount of this Security exchanged.
Upon any such exchange, the Company may, at its sole option, either deliver such shares of the Basket Stocks or pay an amount in cash equal to the Basket Value on the Exchange Notice Date, as determined by the Calculation Agent, in lieu of such Basket Stocks.
The Company will, or will cause the Calculation Agent to, deliver such shares of the Basket Stocks or cash to the Paying Agent for delivery to the Holder of this Security on the fifth Business Day after the Exchange Notice Date, upon delivery of this Security to the Paying Agent. The "" will be the fifth Business Day after the Exchange Notice Date, or, if later, the day on which this Security is delivered to the Paying Agent.
Exchange Settlement Date
If upon exchange of this Security or any portion hereof the Company delivers shares of the Basket Stocks, the Company will pay cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share of any Basket Stock in an amount equal to the value of such fractional shares based on the Closing Price (as defined below) of the Basket Stock as determined by the Calculation Agent on the Trading Day before the Exchange Settlement Date.
Redemption Right
The Company may redeem this Security, in whole but not in part, for settlement on any day from and including March 2, 2014, to and including the Stated Maturity Date, for an amount in cash for each $1,000 principal amount of this Security equal to the greater of (i) the redemption price of $1,000 and (ii) the Basket Value determined by the Calculation Agent on the Trading Day prior to the Redemption Notice Date. This right of the Company to redeem this Security is referred to herein as the "."
Redemption Right
If the Company redeems this Security, the Company will specify the Redemption Date in its notice of redemption. The "" will be 10 days following the day on which the Company gives its notice of redemption (the ""), unless the 10
Redemption Date
Redemption Notice Date
th
day following the Redemption Notice Date is not a Business Day, in which case the Redemption Date will be the immediately following day that is a Business Day. If the Company redeems this Security, the Holder of this Security will not receive any accrued but unpaid interest on the Redemption Date.
If the Company redeems this Security, the Holder of this Security will no longer be able to exercise the Exchange Right.
Business Day Adjustments
If the Stated Maturity Date, any Interest Payment Date, the Redemption Date or any Exchange Settlement Date is not a Business Day, any payments due on this Security on such day will be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such day.
 
Certain Definitions
The "" is initially composed of the common stock of three companies, and consists of a number of shares of each Basket Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio with respect to such Basket Stock.
Basket
The "" are the three stocks set forth in the table below. The table also indicates the proportion of the initial Basket Value represented by the shares of each Basket Stock, the Exchange Ratio for each Basket Stock, the initial stock price of each Basket Stock used to calculate the respective Exchange Ratio and the aggregate value of the shares of each Basket Stock contained in the Basket upon those initial stock prices.
Basket Stocks
 
If, as a result of any event described under "  Adjustment Events" below, this Security is exchangeable into equity securities other than the shares of the Basket Stock Issuers, "" shall include such other securities.
Basket Stocks
The "" (or, individually, a "") are the issuers of the Basket Stocks.
Basket Stock Issuers
Basket Stock Issuer
The "" on any Trading Day equals the sum of the products of the Closing Price and the Exchange Ratio for each Basket Stock, each determined as of such Trading Day by the Calculation Agent. The initial Basket Value is $952.38.
Basket Value
"" shall mean a day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law or regulation to close in New York, New York or Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Business Day
"" shall mean the Calculation Agency Agreement dated as of March 2, 2011 between the Company and the Calculation Agent, as amended from time to time.
Calculation Agency Agreement
"" shall mean the Person that has entered into the Calculation Agency Agreement with the Company, which term shall, unless the context otherwise requires, include its successors under such Calculation Agency Agreement. The initial Calculation Agent shall be Wells Fargo Securities, LLC. Pursuant to the Calculation Agency Agreement, the Company may appoint a different Calculation Agent from time to time after the initial issuance of this Security without the consent of the Holder of this Security and without notifying the Holder of this Security.
Calculation Agent
 
The "" for one share of a Basket Stock (or one unit of any other security for which a Closing Price must be determined) on any Trading Day means:
Closing Price
 
 
If a Basket Stock (or any such other security) is listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange but the last reported sale price is not available pursuant to the preceding sentence, then the Closing Price for one share of that Basket Stock (or one unit of any such other security) on any Trading Day will mean the last reported sale price of the principal trading session on the over-the-counter market or the OTC Bulletin Board on such day.
If the last reported sale price for a Basket Stock (or any such other security) is not available pursuant to either of the two preceding sentences, then the Closing Price for any Trading Day will be the mean, as determined by the Calculation Agent, of the bid prices for that Basket Stock (or any such other security) obtained from as many recognized dealers in such security, but not exceeding three, as will make such bid prices available to the Calculation Agent. Bids of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC or any of its affiliates may be included in the calculation of such mean, but only to the extent that any such bid is the highest of the bids obtained. The term OTC Bulletin Board Service will include any successor service thereto.
A "" means the occurrence or existence of any of the following events:
Market Disruption Event
 
 
 
 
The following events will not be Market Disruption Events:
 
 
For this purpose, an "absence of trading" in the primary securities market on which option or futures contracts relating to a Basket Stock, if available, are traded will not include any time when that market is itself closed for trading under ordinary circumstances. In contrast, a suspension or limitation of trading in option or futures contracts relating to any Basket Stock, if available, in the primary market for those contracts, by reason of any of:
 
 
 
will constitute a suspension or material limitation of trading in option or futures contracts, as the case may be, relating to the Basket Stock in the primary market for those contracts.
Calculation Agent
All determinations made by the Calculation Agent with respect to this Security will be at the sole discretion of the Calculation Agent and, in the absence of manifest error, will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the Holder of this Security. All percentages and other amounts resulting from any calculation with respect to this Security will be rounded at the Calculation Agent's discretion.
Events of Default and Acceleration
In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to this Security has occurred and is continuing, the amount payable to the Holder of this Security upon any acceleration permitted by this Security, with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of this Security, will be equal to the greater of (i) $1,000 and (ii) the Basket Value determined by the Calculation Agent on the date of acceleration.
 
Adjustment Events
The Exchange Ratio is subject to adjustments by the Calculation Agent as a result of the dilution and reorganization adjustments described in this section.
If one of the events described below occurs with respect to any Basket Stock and the Calculation Agent determines that the event has a dilutive or concentrative effect on the market price of such Basket Stock, the Calculation Agent will calculate a corresponding adjustment to the Exchange Ratio as the Calculation Agent deems appropriate to account for that dilutive or concentrative effect. The Exchange Ratio with respect to such Basket Stock will be adjusted by the Calculation Agent by multiplying the existing Exchange Ratio of such Basket Stock by a fraction whose numerator is the number of shares of such Basket Stock outstanding immediately after the dilution or reorganization event and whose denominator is the number of shares of such Basket Stock outstanding immediately prior to the dilution or reorganization event. For example, if an adjustment is required because of a two-for-one stock split, then the Exchange Ratio will be adjusted to double the prior Exchange Ratio, due to the corresponding decrease in the market price of such Basket Stock.
The Calculation Agent will also determine the effective date of that adjustment, and the replacement of the Basket Stock, if applicable, in the event of consolidation or merger of any Basket Stock Issuer, as described more fully below under "  Reorganization Events". Upon making any such adjustment, the Calculation Agent will give notice as soon as practicable to the Trustee and the Paying Agent, stating the adjustment to the Exchange Ratio with respect to such Basket Stock. In no event, however, will an antidilution adjustment to the Exchange Ratio during the term of this Security be deemed to change the principal amount of this Security.
If more than one event requiring adjustment occurs with respect to a Basket Stock, the Calculation Agent will make an adjustment for each event in the order in which the events occur, and on a cumulative basis. Thus, having made an adjustment for the first event, the Calculation Agent will adjust the Exchange Ratio for the second event, applying the required adjustment to the Exchange Ratio as already adjusted for the first event, and so on for any subsequent events.
For any dilution event described below, other than a consolidation or merger, the Calculation Agent will not have to adjust the Exchange Ratio unless the adjustment would result in a change to the Exchange Ratio of any such Basket Stock of at least 0.1% in the Exchange Ratio with respect to such Basket Stock then in effect. The Exchange Ratio with respect to such Basket Stock resulting from any adjustment will be rounded up or down, as appropriate, to the nearest one-hundred thousandth.
If an event requiring an antidilution adjustment occurs, the Calculation Agent will make the adjustment with a view to offsetting, to the extent practical, any change in the economic position of the Holder of this Security relative to this Security that results solely from that event. The Calculation Agent may, in its sole discretion, modify the adjustment events as necessary to ensure an equitable result.
The Calculation Agent will make all determinations with respect to adjustment events, including any determination as to whether an event requiring adjustment has occurred, as to the
 
nature of the adjustment required and how it will be made or as to the value of any property distributed in a reorganization event, and will do so in its sole discretion. In the absence of manifest error, those determinations will be conclusive for all purposes and will be binding on the Holder of this Security and the Company, without any liability on the part of the Calculation Agent. The Holder of this Security will not be entitled to any compensation from the Company for any loss suffered as a result of any of the above determinations by the Calculation Agent. The Calculation Agent will provide information about the adjustments that it makes upon the written request of the Holder of this Security.
The following events are those that may require an antidilution adjustment of the Exchange Ratio with respect to any Basket Stock:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ordinary Dividend Adjustments
In addition to any adjustments to the Exchange Ratio described elsewhere in this section, the Exchange Ratio will be adjusted for changes in the regular quarterly cash dividend payable to holders of such Basket Stock relative to its Base Quarterly Dividend. If there is any change (whether positive or negative) before the Stated Maturity Date or redemption of this Security in the regular
 
quarterly cash dividend payable to holders of any of the Basket Stocks from the Base Quarterly Dividend payable to holders of such Basket Stock, the Exchange Ratio with respect to such Basket Stock will be adjusted (an "") on the related ex-dividend date for such quarterly cash dividend with respect to such Basket Stock (the "") so that the new Exchange Ratio will equal the prior Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Ordinary Dividend Adjustment Factor.
Ordinary Dividend Adjustment
Current Quarterly Dividend
The "" will equal a fraction, the numerator of which is the Closing Price of such Basket Stock on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date for the payment of the Current Quarterly Dividend (such Closing Price, the ""), and the denominator of which is the amount by which the Base Closing Price of such Basket Stock on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date exceeds the Dividend Differential.
Ordinary Dividend Adjustment Factor
Base Closing Price
The "" equals the amount of the Current Quarterly Dividend minus the Base Quarterly Dividend.
Dividend Differential
The "" means (i) with respect to Danaher Corporation, a quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share; (ii) with respect to Textron Inc., a quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share; and with respect to Ingersoll-Rand plc, a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share.
Base Quarterly Dividend
Stock Splits and Reverse Stock Splits
A stock split is an increase in the number of a corporation's outstanding shares of stock without any change in its stockholders' equity. Each outstanding share will be worth less as a result of a stock split.
A reverse stock split is a decrease in the number of a corporation's outstanding shares of stock without any change in its stockholders' equity. Each outstanding share will be worth more as a result of a reverse stock split.
If any Basket Stock is subject to a stock split or a reverse stock split, then once the split has become effective, the Calculation Agent will adjust the Exchange Ratio with respect to such Basket Stock to equal the product of the prior Exchange Ratio of such Basket Stock and the number of shares issued in such stock split or reverse stock split with respect to one share of such Basket Stock.
Stock Dividends
In a stock dividend, a corporation issues additional shares of its stock to all holders of its outstanding stock in proportion to the shares they own. Each outstanding share will be worth less as a result of a stock dividend.
If any Basket Stock is subject to a stock dividend payable in shares of such Basket Stock that is given ratably to all holders of shares of such Basket Stock, then once the dividend has become effective, the Calculation Agent will adjust the Exchange Ratio with respect to such Basket Stock on the ex-dividend date to equal the sum of the prior Exchange Ratio plus the product of the number of shares issued with respect to one share of such Basket Stock and the prior Exchange Ratio. The ex-dividend date for any dividend or other distribution is the first day on and after which such Basket Stock trades without the right to receive that dividend or distribution.
 
No Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions
The Exchange Ratio will not be adjusted to reflect dividends, including cash dividends, or other distributions paid with respect to any Basket Stock, other than:
 
 
 
 
 
"" means each of (a) the full amount per share of a Basket Stock of any cash dividend or special dividend or distribution that is identified by the issuer of a Basket Stock as an extraordinary or special dividend or distribution and (b) the full cash value of any non-cash dividend or distribution per share of such Basket Stock (excluding Marketable Securities, as defined below). Subject to the following sentence, if any cash dividend or distribution of such other property with respect to any Basket Stock includes an Extraordinary Dividend, the Exchange Ratio with respect to such Basket Stock will be adjusted on the ex-dividend date so that the new Exchange Ratio will equal the product of (i) the prior Exchange Ratio and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Base Closing Price (as defined below), and the denominator of which is the amount by which the Base Closing Price exceeds the Extraordinary Dividend. If any Extraordinary Dividend is at least 35% of the Base Closing Price, then, instead of adjusting the Exchange Ratio, upon any exchange or, if the Company redeems this Security and the Basket Value exceeds $1,000, upon the Company's redemption of this Security, the payment, upon an exchange or redemption of this Security, will be determined as described below under "  Reorganization Events," and the Extraordinary Dividend will be allocated to Reference Basket Stocks (as defined below) in accordance with the procedures for a Reference Basket Event as defined and described in clause (c)(ii) below under "  Reorganization Events". For each Basket Stock, "" means the Closing Price of such Basket Stock on the Business Day preceding the "" (that is, the day on and after which transactions in such Basket Stock on an organized securities exchange or trading system no longer carry the right to receive the cash dividend or other cash distribution) for the payment of such cash dividend or other cash distribution. The value of the non-cash component of an Extraordinary Dividend will be determined on the ex-dividend date for such distribution by the Calculation Agent, whose determination shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
Extraordinary Dividend
Base Closing Price
ex-dividend date
To the extent an Extraordinary Dividend is not paid in cash, the value of the non-cash component will be determined by the Calculation Agent, in its sole discretion. A distribution on a Basket Stock that is a dividend payable in shares of Basket Stock, an issuance of rights or warrants
 
or a spin-off event and also an Extraordinary Dividend will result in an adjustment to the number of shares of Basket Stock only as described in "  Stock Dividends" above, "  Transferable Rights and Warrants" below or "  Reorganization Events" below, as the case may be, and not as described here.
Transferable Rights and Warrants
If a Basket Stock Issuer issues transferable rights or warrants to all holders of the Basket Stock to subscribe for or purchase the Basket Stock at an exercise price per share that is less than the Closing Price of the Basket Stock on the Business Day before the ex-dividend date for the issuance, then the Exchange Ratio will be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Exchange Ratio and a fraction, the numerator of which will be the number of shares of the Basket Stock outstanding at the close of business on the Business Day before the ex-dividend date (as adjusted for any subsequent event requiring an adjustment hereunder) plus the number of additional shares of the Basket Stock offered for subscription or purchase pursuant to the rights or warrants and the denominator of which will be the number of shares of the Basket Stock outstanding at the close of business on the Business Day before the ex-dividend date (as adjusted for any subsequent event requiring an adjustment hereunder) plus the number of additional shares of Basket Stock which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of the Basket Stock so offered for subscription or purchase pursuant to the rights or warrants would purchase at the Closing Price on the Business Day before the ex-dividend date for the issuance, which will be determined by multiplying the total number of additional shares of the Basket Stock offered for subscription or purchase pursuant to the rights or warrants by the exercise price of the rights or warrants and dividing the product so obtained by the Closing Price on the Business Day before the ex-dividend date for the issuance. If the number of shares of the Basket Stock actually delivered in respect of the rights or warrants differs from the number of shares of the Basket Stock offered in respect of the rights or warrants, then the Exchange Ratio will promptly be readjusted to the Exchange Ratio which would have been in effect had the adjustment been made on the basis of the number of shares of the Basket Stock actually delivered in respect of the rights or warrants.
Reorganization Events
Any of the following shall constitute a reorganization event:
 
 
 
 
 
 
If any reorganization event occurs, in each case as a result of which the holders of a Basket Stock receive any equity security listed on a national securities exchange (a ""), other securities or other property, assets or cash (collectively ""), upon any exchange or upon the Company's redemption of this Security for an amount per $1,000 principal amount of this Security equal to the Basket Value, the payment with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of this Security following the effective date for such reorganization event (or, if applicable, in the case of Spinoff Stock, the ex-dividend date for the distribution of such Spinoff Stock) will be determined in accordance with the following:
Marketable Security
Exchange Property
(a) if a Basket Stock continues to be outstanding (including, if applicable, as reclassified upon the issuance of any tracking stock), the Exchange Ratio in effect for such Basket Stock on the Exchange Notice Date or the Trading Day prior to the Redemption Notice Date, as applicable, will apply (subject to any adjustments for any distributions that may be made as described in clause (c)(i) below); and
(b) for each Marketable Security received in such reorganization event (each a ""), including the issuance of any tracking stock or Spinoff Stock or the receipt of any stock received in exchange for shares of the Basket Stock, a new share Exchange Ratio will apply equal to the number of shares of the New Stock received with respect to one share of the Basket Stock multiplied by the Exchange Ratio for such Basket Stock on the Business Day immediately prior to the effective date of the reorganization event (the ""), as adjusted to and including the Exchange Notice Date or the Trading Day prior to the Redemption Notice Date, as applicable (subject to any adjustments for any distributions that may be made as described in clause (c)(i) below); and
New Stock
New Stock Exchange Ratio
(c) for any cash and any other property or securities other than Marketable Securities received in such reorganization event (the ""),
Non-Stock Exchange Property
(1) if the Basket Stock continues to be outstanding, a number of shares of the Basket Stock, determined by the Calculation Agent on the Trading Day immediately prior to the effective date of such reorganization event, with an aggregate value equal to the Exchange Ratio in effect for the Basket Stock on such Trading Day multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the Non-Stock Exchange Property on such Trading Day and the denominator of which is the amount by which the Closing Price of the Basket Stock exceeds the value of the Non-Stock Exchange Property on such Trading Day; and the number of such shares of the Basket Stock determined in accordance with this clause will be added at the time of such adjustment to the Exchange Ratio calculated under (a) above,
 
(2) if the Basket Stock is surrendered for Exchange Property that includes New Stock:
(i) if the New Stock is a Marketable Security in existence prior to the effective date of the reorganization event, a number of shares of the New Stock determined by the Calculation Agent on the Trading Day immediately prior to the effective date of such reorganization event with an aggregate value equal to (x) the New Stock Exchange Ratio as calculated under (b) above (without taking into account the additional shares in this provision) multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the value on such Trading Day of the Non-Stock Exchange Property received per share of the Basket Stock and the denominator of which is the amount by which the Closing Price of the New Stock exceeds the value on such Trading Day of the Non-Stock Exchange Property received per share of the Basket Stock, and
(ii) if the New Stock is not a Marketable Security in existence prior to the effective date of the reorganization event, a number of shares of the New Stock determined by the Calculation Agent on the effective date of such reorganization event (or the following Trading Day if such day is not a Trading Day or if a Market Disruption Event occurs or is continuing on such day) with an aggregate value equal to the New Stock Exchange Ratio in effect for the New Stock on such Trading Day multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the value on such Trading Day of the Non-Stock Exchange Property received per share of the Basket Stock and the denominator of which is the amount by which the Closing Price of the New Stock exceeds the value on such Trading Day of the Non-Stock Exchange Property received per share of the Basket Stock, where the number of such shares of the New Stock determined in accordance with this clause will be added to the New Stock Exchange Ratio as calculated under (b) above either at the time of such adjustment, in the case of clause (i) above, or on the date of determination of additional shares, in case of clause (ii) above, or
(3) if the Basket Stock is surrendered exclusively for Non-Stock Exchange Property of the surviving entity in a reorganization event, any Marketable Security of the surviving entity, which shall be chosen by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion, or
(4) if the Basket Stock is surrendered exclusively for Non-Stock Exchange Property of the surviving entity in a reorganization event that has no Marketable Securities, or if there is no surviving entity (in each case, a ""), an initially equal dollar weighted basket of three Reference Basket Stocks with an aggregate value on the effective date of such reorganization event equal to the value of the Non-Stock Exchange Property multiplied by the Exchange Ratio in effect for the Basket Stock on the Trading Day immediately prior to the effective date of such reorganization event.
Reference Basket Event
Reference Basket Events
Following the occurrence of a Reference Basket Event described in paragraph (c)(4) above, the number or shares deliverable upon exchange or the amount payable upon redemption (if the Basket Value exceeds the redemption price of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount of this
 
Security on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Redemption Notice Date) for each $1,000 principal amount of this Security will be determined by reference to Reference Basket Stocks at the Basket Stock Exchange Ratio then in effect for each such a Reference Basket Stock as determined in accordance with the following paragraph.
The "" will be the three stocks with the largest market capitalization among the stocks that then comprise the S&P 500 Index (or, if publication of such Index is discontinued, any successor or substitute index selected by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion) with the same primary Standard Industrial Classification Code ("") as the Basket Stock Issuer; provided, however, that a Reference Basket Stock will not include any stock that is subject to a trading restriction under the trading restriction policies of the Company or any of its affiliates that would materially limit the ability of the Company or any of its affiliates to hedge this Security with respect to such stock. In the event that three Reference Basket Stocks cannot be identified from the S&P 500 Index by primary SIC code for which there is no trading restriction, the remaining Reference Basket Stock(s) will be selected by the Calculation Agent from the largest market capitalization stock(s) within the same Division and Major Group classification (as defined by the Office of Management and Budget) as the primary SIC code for the Basket Stock Issuer. Each Reference Basket Stock will be assigned a Basket Stock Exchange Ratio equal to the number of shares of such Reference Basket Stock with a Closing Price on the effective date of such reorganization event equal to the product of (a) the value of the Non-Stock Exchange Property, (b) the Exchange Ratio in effect for the Basket Stock on the Trading Day immediately prior to the effective date of such reorganization event and (c) 0.3333333.
Reference Basket Stocks
SIC code
Following the allocation of any Extraordinary Dividend to Reference Basket Stocks as described above or any reorganization event described above, the Basket Value on any Business Day determined by the Calculation Agent upon any exchange, redemption or at maturity of this Security with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of this Security will be an amount equal to:
(x) if applicable, the Closing Price of the Basket Stock times the Exchange Ratio for such Basket Stock; and
(y) if applicable, for each New Stock, the Closing Price of such New Stock times the New Stock Exchange Ratio for such New Stock; and
(z) if applicable, for each Reference Basket Stock, the Closing Price of such Reference Basket Stock times the Basket Stock Exchange Ratio for such Reference Basket Stock.
In each case, the applicable Exchange Ratio (including for this purpose, any New Stock Exchange Ratio or Reference Basket Stock Exchange Ratio) will be determined, as applicable, upon any exchange, redemption or at maturity of this Security.
Adjustments for Reorganization Events
If the Holder of this Security exercises the Exchange Right and the Company elects to deliver shares of the Basket Stocks or if the Company redeems this Security for an amount equal to the Basket Value for each $1,000 principal amount of this Security, the Calculation Agent will make such adjustments until, but not beyond, the close of business on the Exchange Notice Date or the Trading Day prior to the Redemption Notice Date, as applicable.
 
If a reorganization event occurs with respect to the shares of a Basket Stock and the Calculation Agent adjusts the Exchange Ratio to reflect the distribution property in the event as described above, the Calculation Agent will make further adjustment events for any later events that affect the distribution property, or any component of the distribution property, comprising the new Exchange Ratio. The Calculation Agent will do so to the same extent that it would make adjustments if the shares of the Basket Stock were outstanding and were affected by the same kinds of events. If a subsequent reorganization event affects only a particular component of the number of shares of the Basket Stock, the required adjustment will be made with respect to that component, as if it alone were the number of shares of the Basket Stock.
 
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature or its duly authorized agent under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

This Security is exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form only if (x) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Security or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and a successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, (y) the Company in its sole discretion determines that this Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form and notifies the Trustee thereof or (z) an Event of Default with respect to the Securities represented hereby has occurred and is continuing.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel for Wells Fargo & Company (the "Company") in connection with (i) the preparation of a Registration Statement on Form S-3, File No. 333-159738 (the "Registration Statement"), of the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to the proposed offer and sale from time to time of the securities referred to therein and (ii) Pricing Supplement No. 71 dated February 23, 2011 to the Prospectus Supplement dated April 23, 2010 and the Prospectus dated June 4, 2009 relating to the offer and sale by the Company under the Registration Statement of $12,155,000 aggregate principal amount of Medium-Term Notes, Series K, 0.125% Exchangeable Notes due March 2, 2016 (the "Notes").

As contemplated by the foregoing qualifications, in rendering the foregoing opinion, we are expressing no opinion as to Federal or state laws relating to fraudulent transfers. Without limiting any other qualifications set forth herein, the opinions expressed herein are subject to the effect of generally applicable laws that limit the waiver of rights under usury laws.
