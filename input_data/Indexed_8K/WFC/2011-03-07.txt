Discontinuance Of The Index; Alteration Of Method Of Calculation
If the Index Sponsor discontinues publication of the Index, and the Index Sponsor or another entity publishes a successor or substitute equity index that the Calculation Agent determines, in its sole discretion, to be comparable to the Index (a ""),
Successor Equity Index
 
then, upon the Calculation Agent's notification of that determination to the Trustee and the Company, the Calculation Agent will substitute the Successor Equity Index as calculated by the relevant Index Sponsor or any other entity and calculate the Ending Level as described above. Upon any selection by the Calculation Agent of a Successor Equity Index, the Company will cause notice to be given to the Holder of this Security.
In the event that the Index Sponsor discontinues publication of the Index and the Calculation Agent does not select a Successor Equity Index, the Calculation Agent will compute a substitute level for the Index in accordance with the procedures last used to calculate the Index before any discontinuance. If a Successor Equity Index is selected or the Calculation Agent calculates a level as a substitute for the Index, the Successor Equity Index or level will be used as a substitute for the Index for all purposes, including the purpose of determining whether a Market Disruption Event exists.
If at any time the Index Sponsor makes a material change in the formula for or the method of calculating the Index, or in any other way materially modifies the Index so that the Index does not, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent, fairly represent the level of the Index had those changes or modifications not been made, then, from and after that time, the Calculation Agent will, at the close of business in New York, New York, on the date that the Closing Level of the Index is to be calculated, make any adjustments as, in the good faith judgment of the Calculation Agent, may be necessary in order to arrive at a value of an equity index comparable to the Index as if those changes or modifications had not been made, and calculate the level of the Index with reference to such equity index, as so adjusted. Accordingly, if the method of calculating the Index is modified so that the level of the Index is a fraction or a multiple of what it would have been if it had not been modified, then the Calculation Agent will adjust the Index in order to arrive at a level of the Index as if it had not been modified.
Market Disruption Events
A "" means, with respect to the Index, any of the following events as determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion:
Market Disruption Event
 
 
 
 
 
For purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred:
 
 
 
 
Calculation Agent
The Calculation Agent will determine the Redemption Amount and the Ending Level. In addition, the Calculation Agent will (i) determine if adjustments are required to the Closing Level of the Index under the circumstances described in this Security, (ii) if publication of the Index is discontinued, select a Successor Equity Index or, if no Successor Equity Index is available, determine the Closing Level of the Index under the circumstances described in this Security, and (iii) determine whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred.
The Company covenants that, so long as this Security is Outstanding, there shall at all times be a Calculation Agent (which shall be a broker-dealer, bank or other financial institution) with respect to this Security.
All determinations made by the Calculation Agent with respect to this Security will be at the sole discretion of the Calculation Agent and, in the absence of manifest error, will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the Holder of this Security. All percentages and other amounts resulting from any calculation with respect to this Security will be rounded at the Calculation Agent's discretion.
Tax Considerations
The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a beneficial ownership interest in this Security each Holder of this Security will be deemed to have agreed (in the absence of a statutory, regulatory, administrative or judicial ruling to the contrary), for United States federal income tax purposes to characterize and treat this Security as a pre-paid derivative contract in respect of the Index.
Redemption and Repayment
This Security is not subject to redemption at the option of the Company or repayment at the option of the Holder hereof prior to September 9, 2013. This Security is not entitled to any sinking fund.
Acceleration
If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to this Security shall occur and be continuing, the Redemption Amount (calculated as set forth in the next sentence) of this Security may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The amount payable to the Holder hereof upon any acceleration permitted under the Indenture will be equal to the Redemption Amount hereof calculated as provided herein as though the date of acceleration was the Calculation Day; provided, however, if such date is not a Trading Day or if a Market Disruption Event has occurred or is continuing on that day, the Calculation Day will be postponed as provided herein.
 
 
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature or its duly authorized agent under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

Market Disruption Event
 
 
 
 
 
For purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred:
 
 
Anti-dilution Adjustments Relating to the Fund; Alternate Calculation
Anti-dilution Adjustments
The Calculation Agent, in its sole discretion, may adjust the Adjustment Factor as a result of certain events related to the Fund or any Successor Fund, as applicable, which occur during the term of this Security. Such events include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
If a stock split or reverse stock split has occurred, then once such split has become effective, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the number of securities which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of the Fund before the effective date of such stock split or reverse stock split would have owned or been entitled to receive immediately following the applicable effective date.
 
If a (i) stock dividend (i.e., issuance of additional shares (or other applicable security) by the Fund) that is given ratably to all holders of record of shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund or (ii) distribution of shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund has occurred, then once the dividend has become effective and the shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund are trading ex-dividend, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted on the ex-dividend date to equal the prior Adjustment Factor plus the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the number of shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of the Fund before the date the dividend became effective and the shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund traded ex-dividend would have owned or been entitled to receive immediately following that date; provided, however, that no adjustment will be made for a distribution for which the number of securities of the Fund paid or distributed is based on a fixed cash equivalent value, unless such distribution is an Extraordinary Dividend as defined and discussed below.
 
If an Extraordinary Dividend (as defined below) has occurred, then on the ex-dividend date, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and a fraction, the numerator of which is the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of the Fund on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date, and the denominator of which is the amount by
 
which the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of the Fund on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date exceeds the Extraordinary Dividend Amount (as defined below).
For purposes of determining whether an Extraordinary Dividend has occurred:
 
 
 
 
To the extent an Extraordinary Dividend is not paid in cash, the value of the non-cash component will be determined by the Calculation Agent. A distribution on the securities of the Fund described below under the sections entitled "Other Distributions" and "Reorganization Events" below that also constitute an Extraordinary Dividend will only cause an adjustment pursuant to those sections.
 
If the Fund declares or makes a distribution to all holders of the shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund of any class of its capital stock, evidences of its indebtedness or other non-cash assets, including, but not limited to, transferable rights and warrants, then, in each of these cases, the Adjustment Factor will equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and a fraction, the numerator of which will be the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of the Fund, and the denominator of which will be the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of the Fund, less the fair market value, as determined by the Calculation
 
Agent, as of the time the adjustment is effected of the portion of the capital shares, assets, evidences of indebtedness, rights or warrants so distributed or issued applicable to one share (or other applicable security) of the Fund.
 
If the Fund, or any Successor Fund, is subject to a merger, combination, consolidation or statutory exchange of securities with another exchange traded fund, and the Fund is not the surviving entity, then, on or after the date of such event, the Calculation Agent shall, in its sole discretion, make an adjustment to the Adjustment Factor or the method of determining the Redemption Amount or any other terms of this Security as the Calculation Agent determines appropriate to account for the economic effect on this Security of such event (including adjustments to account for changes in volatility, expected dividends, stock loan rate or liquidity relevant to this Security), and determine the effective date of that adjustment. If the Calculation Agent determines that no adjustment that it could make will produce a commercially reasonable result, then the Calculation Agent may deem such event a Liquidation Event (as defined below).
Liquidation Events
If the Fund is de-listed, liquidated or otherwise terminated (a ""), and a successor or substitute exchange traded fund exists that the Calculation Agent determines, in its sole discretion, to be comparable to the Fund, then, upon the Calculation Agent's notification of that determination to the Trustee and the Company, any subsequent Fund Closing Price for the Fund will be determined by reference to the Fund Closing Price of such successor or substitute exchange traded fund (such exchange traded fund being referred to herein as a "").
Liquidation Event
Successor Fund
Upon any selection by the Calculation Agent of a Successor Fund, the Company will cause notice to be given to Holder of this Security.
If the Fund undergoes a Liquidation Event prior to, and such Liquidation Event is continuing on, the date that the Fund Closing Price of the Fund is to be determined and the Calculation Agent determines that no Successor Fund is available at such time, then the Calculation Agent will, in its discretion, calculate the Fund Closing Price for the Fund on such date by a computation methodology that the Calculation Agent determines will as closely as reasonably possible replicate the Fund.
If a Successor Fund is selected or the Calculation Agent calculates the Fund Closing Price as a substitute for the Fund, such Successor Fund or Fund Closing Price will be used as a substitute for the Fund for all purposes, including for purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event exists.
If at any time the method of calculating the Fund or a Successor Fund, or the MSCI Emerging Markets Index (the index underlying the Fund), is changed in a material respect, or if
 
the Fund or a Successor Fund is in any other way modified so that the Fund does not, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent, fairly represent the price of the securities of the Fund or such Successor Fund had such changes or modifications not been made, then the Calculation Agent will, at the close of business in New York City on the date that the Fund Closing Price is to be determined, make such calculations and adjustments as, in the good faith judgment of the Calculation Agent, may be necessary in order to arrive at a Closing Price of an exchange traded fund comparable to the Fund or such Successor Fund, as the case may be, as if such changes or modifications had not been made, and calculate the Fund Closing Price and the Redemption Amount with reference to such adjusted Closing Price of the Fund or such Successor Fund, as applicable.
Calculation Agent
The Calculation Agent will determine the Redemption Amount and the Ending Price. In addition, the Calculation Agent will (i) determine if adjustments are required to the Fund Closing Price and/or the Adjustment Factor under the circumstances described in this Security, (ii) if the Fund undergoes a Liquidation Event, select a Successor Fund or, if no Successor Fund is available, determine the Fund Closing Price of the Fund, and (iii) determine whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred.
The Company covenants that, so long as this Security is Outstanding, there shall at all times be a Calculation Agent (which shall be a broker-dealer, bank or other financial institution) with respect to this Security.
All determinations made by the Calculation Agent with respect to this Security will be at the sole discretion of the Calculation Agent and, in the absence of manifest error, will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the Holder of this Security. All percentages and other amounts resulting from any calculation with respect to this Security will be rounded at the Calculation Agent's discretion.
Tax Considerations
The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a beneficial ownership interest in this Security each Holder of this Security will be deemed to have agreed (in the absence of a statutory, regulatory, administrative or judicial ruling to the contrary), for United States federal income tax purposes to characterize and treat this Security as a pre-paid derivative contract in respect of the Fund.
Redemption and Repayment
This Security is not subject to redemption at the option of the Company or repayment at the option of the Holder hereof prior to September 8, 2014. This Security is not entitled to any sinking fund.
Acceleration
If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to this Security shall occur and be continuing, the Redemption Amount (calculated as set forth in the next sentence) of this
 
Security may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The amount payable to the Holder hereof upon any acceleration permitted under the Indenture will be equal to the Redemption Amount hereof calculated as provided herein as though the date of acceleration was the Calculation Day; provided, however, if such date is not a Trading Day or if a Market Disruption Event has occurred or is continuing on that day, the Calculation Day will be postponed as provided herein.
 
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature or its duly authorized agent under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.

For purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred:
 
 
Anti-dilution Adjustments Relating to the Fund; Alternate Calculation
Anti-dilution Adjustments
The Calculation Agent, in its sole discretion, may adjust the Adjustment Factor as a result of certain events related to the Fund or any Successor Fund, as applicable, which occur during the term of this Security. Such events include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
If a stock split or reverse stock split has occurred, then once such split has become effective, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the number of securities which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of the Fund before the effective date of such stock split or reverse stock split would have owned or been entitled to receive immediately following the applicable effective date.
 
If a (i) stock dividend (i.e., issuance of additional shares (or other applicable security) by the Fund) that is given ratably to all holders of record of shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund or (ii) distribution of shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund has occurred, then once the dividend has become effective and the shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund are trading ex-dividend, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted on the ex-dividend date to equal the prior Adjustment Factor plus the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the number of shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of the Fund before the date the dividend became effective and the shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund traded ex-dividend would have owned or been entitled to receive immediately following that date; provided, however, that no adjustment will be made for a distribution for which the number of securities of the Fund paid or distributed is based on a fixed cash equivalent value, unless such distribution is an Extraordinary Dividend as defined and discussed below.
 
If an Extraordinary Dividend (as defined below) has occurred, then on the ex-dividend date, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and a fraction, the numerator of which is the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of the Fund on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date, and the denominator of which is the amount by
 
which the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of the Fund on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date exceeds the Extraordinary Dividend Amount (as defined below).
For purposes of determining whether an Extraordinary Dividend has occurred:
 
 
 
 
To the extent an Extraordinary Dividend is not paid in cash, the value of the non-cash component will be determined by the Calculation Agent. A distribution on the securities of the Fund described below under the sections entitled "Other Distributions" and "Reorganization Events" below that also constitute an Extraordinary Dividend will only cause an adjustment pursuant to those sections.
 
If the Fund declares or makes a distribution to all holders of the shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund of any class of its capital stock, evidences of its indebtedness or other non-cash assets, including, but not limited to, transferable rights and warrants, then, in each of these cases, the Adjustment Factor will equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and a fraction, the numerator of which will be the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of the Fund, and the denominator of which will be the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of the Fund, less the fair market value, as determined by the Calculation
 
Agent, as of the time the adjustment is effected of the portion of the capital shares, assets, evidences of indebtedness, rights or warrants so distributed or issued applicable to one share (or other applicable security) of the Fund.
 
If the Fund, or any Successor Fund, is subject to a merger, combination, consolidation or statutory exchange of securities with another exchange traded fund, and the Fund is not the surviving entity, then, on or after the date of such event, the Calculation Agent shall, in its sole discretion, make an adjustment to the Adjustment Factor or the method of determining the Redemption Amount or any other terms of this Security as the Calculation Agent determines appropriate to account for the economic effect on this Security of such event (including adjustments to account for changes in volatility, expected dividends, stock loan rate or liquidity relevant to this Security), and determine the effective date of that adjustment. If the Calculation Agent determines that no adjustment that it could make will produce a commercially reasonable result, then the Calculation Agent may deem such event a Liquidation Event (as defined below).
Liquidation Events
If the Fund is de-listed, liquidated or otherwise terminated (a ""), and a successor or substitute exchange traded fund exists that the Calculation Agent determines, in its sole discretion, to be comparable to the Fund, then, upon the Calculation Agent's notification of that determination to the Trustee and the Company, any subsequent Fund Closing Price for the Fund will be determined by reference to the Fund Closing Price of such successor or substitute exchange traded fund (such exchange traded fund being referred to herein as a "").
Liquidation Event
Successor Fund
Upon any selection by the Calculation Agent of a Successor Fund, the Company will cause notice to be given to Holder of this Security.
If the Fund undergoes a Liquidation Event prior to, and such Liquidation Event is continuing on, the date that the Fund Closing Price of the Fund is to be determined and the Calculation Agent determines that no Successor Fund is available at such time, then the Calculation Agent will, in its discretion, calculate the Fund Closing Price for the Fund on such date by a computation methodology that the Calculation Agent determines will as closely as reasonably possible replicate the Fund.
If a Successor Fund is selected or the Calculation Agent calculates the Fund Closing Price as a substitute for the Fund, such Successor Fund or Fund Closing Price will be used as a substitute for the Fund for all purposes, including for purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event exists.
If at any time the method of calculating the Fund or a Successor Fund, or the Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index (the index underlying the Fund), is changed in a material respect, or if the
 
Fund or a Successor Fund is in any other way modified so that the Fund does not, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent, fairly represent the price of the securities of the Fund or such Successor Fund had such changes or modifications not been made, then the Calculation Agent will, at the close of business in New York City on the date that the Fund Closing Price is to be determined, make such calculations and adjustments as, in the good faith judgment of the Calculation Agent, may be necessary in order to arrive at a Closing Price of an exchange traded fund comparable to the Fund or such Successor Fund, as the case may be, as if such changes or modifications had not been made, and calculate the Fund Closing Price and the Redemption Amount with reference to such adjusted Closing Price of the Fund or such Successor Fund, as applicable.
Calculation Agent
The Calculation Agent will determine the Redemption Amount and the Ending Price. In addition, the Calculation Agent will (i) determine if adjustments are required to the Fund Closing Price and/or the Adjustment Factor under the circumstances described in this Security, (ii) if the Fund undergoes a Liquidation Event, select a Successor Fund or, if no Successor Fund is available, determine the Fund Closing Price of the Fund, and (iii) determine whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred.
The Company covenants that, so long as this Security is Outstanding, there shall at all times be a Calculation Agent (which shall be a broker-dealer, bank or other financial institution) with respect to this Security.
All determinations made by the Calculation Agent with respect to this Security will be at the sole discretion of the Calculation Agent and, in the absence of manifest error, will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the Holder of this Security. All percentages and other amounts resulting from any calculation with respect to this Security will be rounded at the Calculation Agent's discretion.
Tax Considerations
The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a beneficial ownership interest in this Security each Holder of this Security will be deemed to have agreed (in the absence of a statutory, regulatory, administrative or judicial ruling to the contrary), for United States federal income tax purposes to characterize and treat this Security as a pre-paid derivative contract in respect of the Fund.
Redemption and Repayment
This Security is not subject to redemption at the option of the Company or repayment at the option of the Holder hereof prior to March 7, 2014. This Security is not entitled to any sinking fund.
Acceleration
If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to this Security shall occur and be continuing, the Redemption Amount (calculated as set forth in the next sentence) of this
 
Security may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The amount payable to the Holder hereof upon any acceleration permitted under the Indenture will be equal to the Redemption Amount hereof calculated as provided herein as though the date of acceleration was the Calculation Day; provided, however, if such date is not a Trading Day or if a Market Disruption Event has occurred or is continuing on that day, the Calculation Day will be postponed as provided herein.
 
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature or its duly authorized agent under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

Market Disruption Event
 
 
 
 
 
 
For purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred:
 
 
 
Anti-dilution Adjustments Relating To A Basket Component; Alternate Calculation
Anti-dilution Adjustments
The Calculation Agent, in its sole discretion, may adjust the Adjustment Factor as a result of certain events related to a Basket Component or any Successor Fund, as applicable, which occur during the term of this Security. Such events include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
If a stock split or reverse stock split has occurred, then once such split has become effective, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the number of securities which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component before the effective date of such stock split or reverse stock split would have owned or been entitled to receive immediately following the applicable effective date.
 
If a (i) stock dividend (i.e., issuance of additional shares (or other applicable security) by a Basket Component) that is given ratably to all holders of record of shares (or other applicable security) of a Basket Component or (ii) distribution of shares (or other applicable security) of a Basket Component has occurred, then once the dividend has become effective and the shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component are trading ex-dividend, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted on the ex-dividend date to equal the prior Adjustment Factor plus the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the number of shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component before the date the dividend became effective and the shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component traded ex-dividend would have owned or been entitled to receive immediately following that date; provided, however, that no adjustment will be made for a distribution for which the number of securities of such Basket Component paid or distributed is based on a fixed cash equivalent value, unless such distribution is an Extraordinary Dividend as defined and discussed below.
 
If an Extraordinary Dividend (as defined below) has occurred, then on the ex-dividend date, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and a fraction, the numerator of which is the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date, and the denominator of which is the amount by which the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date exceeds the Extraordinary Dividend Amount (as defined below).
 
For purposes of determining whether an Extraordinary Dividend has occurred:
 
 
 
 
To the extent an Extraordinary Dividend is not paid in cash, the value of the non-cash component will be determined by the Calculation Agent. A distribution on the securities of such Basket Component described below under the sections entitled "Other Distributions" and "Reorganization Events" below that also constitute an Extraordinary Dividend will only cause an adjustment pursuant to those sections.
 
If a Basket Component declares or makes a distribution to all holders of the shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component of any class of its capital stock, evidences of its indebtedness or other non-cash assets, including, but not limited to, transferable rights and warrants, then, in each of these cases, the Adjustment Factor will equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and a fraction, the numerator of which will be the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component, and the denominator of which will be the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket
 
Component, less the fair market value, as determined by the Calculation Agent, as of the time the adjustment is effected of the portion of the capital shares, assets, evidences of indebtedness, rights or warrants so distributed or issued applicable to one share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component.
 
If a Basket Component, or any Successor Fund, is subject to a merger, combination, consolidation or statutory exchange of securities with another exchange traded fund, and such Basket Component is not the surviving entity, then, on or after the date of such event, the Calculation Agent shall, in its sole discretion, make an adjustment to the Adjustment Factor or the method of determining the Redemption Amount or any other terms of this Security as the Calculation Agent determines appropriate to account for the economic effect on this Security of such event (including adjustments to account for changes in volatility, expected dividends, stock loan rate or liquidity relevant to this Security), and determine the effective date of that adjustment. If the Calculation Agent determines that no adjustment that it could make will produce a commercially reasonable result, then the Calculation Agent may deem such event a Liquidation Event (as defined below).
Liquidation Events
If a Basket Component is de-listed, liquidated or otherwise terminated (a ""), and a successor or substitute exchange traded fund exists that the Calculation Agent determines, in its sole discretion, to be comparable to such Basket Component, then, upon the Calculation Agent's notification of that determination to the Trustee and the Company, any subsequent Fund Closing Price for such Basket Component will be determined by reference to the Fund Closing Price of such successor or substitute exchange traded fund (such exchange traded fund being referred to herein as a "").
Liquidation Event
Successor Fund
Upon any selection by the Calculation Agent of a Successor Fund, the Company will cause notice to be given to Holder of this Security.
If a Basket Component undergoes a Liquidation Event prior to, and such Liquidation Event is continuing on, the date that the Fund Closing Price of such Basket Component is to be determined and the Calculation Agent determines that no Successor Fund is available at such time, then the Calculation Agent will, in its discretion, calculate the Fund Closing Price for such Basket Component on such date by a computation methodology that the Calculation Agent determines will as closely as reasonably possible replicate such Basket Component.
If a Successor Fund is selected or the Calculation Agent calculates the Fund Closing Price as a substitute for a Basket Component, such Successor Fund or Fund Closing Price will be used as a substitute for such Basket Component for all purposes, including for purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event exists.
 
If at any time the method of calculating a Basket Component or a Successor Fund, or the related Underlying Index, is changed in a material respect, or if a Basket Component or a Successor Fund is in any other way modified so that such Basket Component does not, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent, fairly represent the price of the securities of such Basket Component or such Successor Fund had such changes or modifications not been made, then the Calculation Agent will, at the close of business in New York City on the date that the Fund Closing Price is to be determined, make such calculations and adjustments as, in the good faith judgment of the Calculation Agent, may be necessary in order to arrive at a Closing Price of an exchange traded fund comparable to such Basket Component or Successor Fund, as the case may be, as if such changes or modifications had not been made, and calculate the Fund Closing Price and the Redemption Amount with reference to such adjusted Closing Price of such Basket Component or such Successor Fund, as applicable.
Calculation Agent
The Calculation Agent will determine the Redemption Amount and the Ending Price. In addition, the Calculation Agent will (i) determine if adjustments are required to the Fund Closing Price and/or the Adjustment Factor of a Basket Component under the circumstances described in this Security, (ii) if a Basket Component undergoes a Liquidation Event, select a Successor Fund or, if no Successor Fund is available, determine the Fund Closing Price of such Basket Component, and (iii) determine whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred.
The Company covenants that, so long as this Security is Outstanding, there shall at all times be a Calculation Agent (which shall be a broker-dealer, bank or other financial institution) with respect to this Security.
All determinations made by the Calculation Agent with respect to this Security will be at the sole discretion of the Calculation Agent and, in the absence of manifest error, will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the Holder of this Security. All percentages and other amounts resulting from any calculation with respect to this Security will be rounded at the Calculation Agent's discretion.
Tax Considerations
The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a beneficial ownership interest in this Security each Holder of this Security will be deemed to have agreed (in the absence of a statutory, regulatory, administrative or judicial ruling to the contrary), for United States federal income tax purposes to characterize and treat this Security as a pre-paid derivative contract in respect of the Basket.
Redemption and Repayment
This Security is not subject to redemption at the option of the Company or repayment at the option of the Holder hereof prior to March 6, 2015. This Security is not entitled to any sinking fund.
 
Acceleration
If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to this Security shall occur and be continuing, the Redemption Amount (calculated as set forth in the next sentence) of this Security may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The amount payable to the Holder hereof upon any acceleration permitted under the Indenture will be equal to the Redemption Amount hereof calculated as provided herein as though the date of acceleration was the Calculation Day; provided, however, if such date is not a Trading Day or if a Market Disruption Event has occurred or is continuing on that day, the Calculation Day will be postponed as provided herein.
 
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature or its duly authorized agent under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.

Market Disruption Event
 
 
 
 
 
 
For purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred:
 
 
 
Anti-dilution Adjustments Relating To A Basket Component; Alternate Calculation
Anti-dilution Adjustments
The Calculation Agent, in its sole discretion, may adjust the Adjustment Factor as a result of certain events related to a Basket Component or any Successor Fund, as applicable, which occur during the term of this Security. Such events include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
If a stock split or reverse stock split has occurred, then once such split has become effective, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the number of securities which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component before the effective date of such stock split or reverse stock split would have owned or been entitled to receive immediately following the applicable effective date.
 
If a (i) stock dividend (i.e., issuance of additional shares (or other applicable security) by a Basket Component) that is given ratably to all holders of record of shares (or other applicable security) of a Basket Component or (ii) distribution of shares (or other applicable security) of a Basket Component has occurred, then once the dividend has become effective and the shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component are trading ex-dividend, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted on the ex-dividend date to equal the prior Adjustment Factor plus the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the number of shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component before the date the dividend became effective and the shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component traded ex-dividend would have owned or been entitled to receive immediately following that date; provided, however, that no adjustment will be made for a distribution for which the number of securities of such Basket Component paid or distributed is based on a fixed cash equivalent value, unless such distribution is an Extraordinary Dividend as defined and discussed below.
 
If an Extraordinary Dividend (as defined below) has occurred, then on the ex-dividend date, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and a fraction, the numerator of which is the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date, and the denominator of which is the amount by which the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date exceeds the Extraordinary Dividend Amount (as defined below).
 
For purposes of determining whether an Extraordinary Dividend has occurred:
 
 
 
 
To the extent an Extraordinary Dividend is not paid in cash, the value of the non-cash component will be determined by the Calculation Agent. A distribution on the securities of such Basket Component described below under the sections entitled "Other Distributions" and "Reorganization Events" below that also constitute an Extraordinary Dividend will only cause an adjustment pursuant to those sections.
 
If a Basket Component declares or makes a distribution to all holders of the shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component of any class of its capital stock, evidences of its indebtedness or other non-cash assets, including, but not limited to, transferable rights and warrants, then, in each of these cases, the Adjustment Factor will equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and a fraction, the numerator of which will be the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component, and the denominator of which will be the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket
 
Component, less the fair market value, as determined by the Calculation Agent, as of the time the adjustment is effected of the portion of the capital shares, assets, evidences of indebtedness, rights or warrants so distributed or issued applicable to one share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component.
 
If a Basket Component, or any Successor Fund, is subject to a merger, combination, consolidation or statutory exchange of securities with another exchange traded fund, and such Basket Component is not the surviving entity, then, on or after the date of such event, the Calculation Agent shall, in its sole discretion, make an adjustment to the Adjustment Factor or the method of determining the Redemption Amount or any other terms of this Security as the Calculation Agent determines appropriate to account for the economic effect on this Security of such event (including adjustments to account for changes in volatility, expected dividends, stock loan rate or liquidity relevant to this Security), and determine the effective date of that adjustment. If the Calculation Agent determines that no adjustment that it could make will produce a commercially reasonable result, then the Calculation Agent may deem such event a Liquidation Event (as defined below).
Liquidation Events
If a Basket Component is de-listed, liquidated or otherwise terminated (a ""), and a successor or substitute exchange traded fund exists that the Calculation Agent determines, in its sole discretion, to be comparable to such Basket Component, then, upon the Calculation Agent's notification of that determination to the Trustee and the Company, any subsequent Fund Closing Price for such Basket Component will be determined by reference to the Fund Closing Price of such successor or substitute exchange traded fund (such exchange traded fund being referred to herein as a "").
Liquidation Event
Successor Fund
Upon any selection by the Calculation Agent of a Successor Fund, the Company will cause notice to be given to Holder of this Security.
If a Basket Component undergoes a Liquidation Event prior to, and such Liquidation Event is continuing on, the date that the Fund Closing Price of such Basket Component is to be determined and the Calculation Agent determines that no Successor Fund is available at such time, then the Calculation Agent will, in its discretion, calculate the Fund Closing Price for such Basket Component on such date by a computation methodology that the Calculation Agent determines will as closely as reasonably possible replicate such Basket Component.
If a Successor Fund is selected or the Calculation Agent calculates the Fund Closing Price as a substitute for a Basket Component, such Successor Fund or Fund Closing Price will be used as a substitute for such Basket Component for all purposes, including for purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event exists.
 
If at any time the method of calculating a Basket Component or a Successor Fund, or the related Underlying Index, is changed in a material respect, or if a Basket Component or a Successor Fund is in any other way modified so that such Basket Component does not, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent, fairly represent the price of the securities of such Basket Component or such Successor Fund had such changes or modifications not been made, then the Calculation Agent will, at the close of business in New York City on the date that the Fund Closing Price is to be determined, make such calculations and adjustments as, in the good faith judgment of the Calculation Agent, may be necessary in order to arrive at a Closing Price of an exchange traded fund comparable to such Basket Component or Successor Fund, as the case may be, as if such changes or modifications had not been made, and calculate the Fund Closing Price and the Redemption Amount with reference to such adjusted Closing Price of such Basket Component or such Successor Fund, as applicable.
Calculation Agent
The Calculation Agent will determine the Redemption Amount and the Ending Price. In addition, the Calculation Agent will (i) determine if adjustments are required to the Fund Closing Price and/or the Adjustment Factor of a Basket Component under the circumstances described in this Security, (ii) if a Basket Component undergoes a Liquidation Event, select a Successor Fund or, if no Successor Fund is available, determine the Fund Closing Price of such Basket Component, and (iii) determine whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred.
The Company covenants that, so long as this Security is Outstanding, there shall at all times be a Calculation Agent (which shall be a broker-dealer, bank or other financial institution) with respect to this Security.
All determinations made by the Calculation Agent with respect to this Security will be at the sole discretion of the Calculation Agent and, in the absence of manifest error, will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the Holder of this Security. All percentages and other amounts resulting from any calculation with respect to this Security will be rounded at the Calculation Agent's discretion.
Tax Considerations
The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a beneficial ownership interest in this Security each Holder of this Security will be deemed to have agreed (in the absence of a statutory, regulatory, administrative or judicial ruling to the contrary), for United States federal income tax purposes to characterize and treat this Security as a pre-paid derivative contract in respect of the Basket.
Redemption and Repayment
This Security is not subject to redemption at the option of the Company or repayment at the option of the Holder hereof prior to December 8, 2014. This Security is not entitled to any sinking fund.
 
Acceleration
If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to this Security shall occur and be continuing, the Redemption Amount (calculated as set forth in the next sentence) of this Security may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The amount payable to the Holder hereof upon any acceleration permitted under the Indenture will be equal to the Redemption Amount hereof calculated as provided herein as though the date of acceleration was the Calculation Day; provided, however, if such date is not a Trading Day or if a Market Disruption Event has occurred or is continuing on that day, the Calculation Day will be postponed as provided herein.
 
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature or its duly authorized agent under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.

Exhibit 5.4
Wells Fargo & Company
420 Montgomery Street
San Francisco, California 94163
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel for Wells Fargo & Company (the "Company") in connection with (i) the preparation of a Registration Statement on Form S-3, File No. 333-159736 (the "First Registration Statement"), of the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to the proposed offer and sale from time to time of the securities referred to therein, (ii) the preparation of a Registration Statement on Form S-3, File No. 333-159738 (the "Second Registration Statement") of the Company filed with the Commission under the Securities Act, relating to the proposed offer and sale from time to time of the securities referred to therein, (iii) the issuance of the debt securities identified on Annex A hereto under the First Registration Statement, and (iv) the issuance of the debt securities identified in Annex B hereto under the Second Registration Statement. The debt securities identified on Annexes A and B hereto are referred to collectively as the "Securities." The Securities were issued under the Indenture dated as of July 21, 1999 (the "Indenture") entered into by the Company and Citibank, N.A., as trustee.
We have examined such documents, records, and instruments as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Securities have been duly authorized and, assuming due execution by the Company and authentication in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and assuming that the consideration specified for such Securities in the corporate proceedings of the Company relating to the issuance of such Securities was received by the Company, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance, receivership or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and subject to general equity principles including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith, fair dealing and the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and except further as enforcement thereof may be limited by any governmental authority that limits, delays or prohibits the making of payments outside of the United States. As contemplated by the foregoing qualifications, in rendering the foregoing opinion, we are

expressing no opinion as to Federal or state laws relating to fraudulent transfers. Without limiting any other qualifications set forth herein, the opinions expressed herein are subject to the effect of generally applicable laws that limit the waiver of rights under usury laws.
We have relied as to certain relevant facts upon certificates of, and/or information provided by, officers and employees of the Company as to the accuracy of such factual matters without independent verification thereof or other investigation. We have also relied, without investigation, upon the following assumptions: (i) natural persons acting on behalf of the Company have sufficient legal capacity to enter into and perform, on behalf of the Company, the transactions in question; (ii) each party to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreements or instruments enforceable against it; (iii) each party to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company has complied with all legal requirements pertaining to its status as such status relates to its rights to enforce such agreements or instruments against the Company; and (iv) each document submitted to us for review is accurate and complete, each such document that is an original is authentic, each such document that is a copy conforms to an authentic original, and all signatures on each such document are genuine.
The opinions expressed herein are limited to the specific issues addressed herein. Furthermore, the opinions expressed herein with respect to an issuance of Securities under the First Registration Statement or the Second Registration Statement are given as of the issue date of such Securities as specified in Annex A or Annex B hereto, as applicable, and are limited to the facts and laws existing on such issue date. By rendering our opinion, we do not undertake to advise you with respect to any other matter or, with respect to an issuance of Securities, of any change in such laws or in the interpretation thereof, or of any changes in such facts, which may have occurred after the issue date of such Securities.
Our opinions set forth herein are limited to the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (which is comprised of the Delaware general corporation statute codified in Chapter 1 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code, all relevant provisions of the Delaware constitution and all reported case law interpreting or applying that statute or those provisions) and the federal laws of the United States of America, and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of any other laws.
