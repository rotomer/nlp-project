Calculation Agent
Discontinuance Of The Index; Alteration Of Method Of Calculation
If the Index Sponsor discontinues publication of the Index, and the Index Sponsor or another entity publishes a successor or substitute commodity index that the Calculation Agent determines, in its sole discretion, to be comparable to the Index (a ""), then, upon the Calculation Agent's notification of that determination to the Trustee and the Company, the Calculation Agent will substitute the Successor Commodity Index as calculated by the relevant index sponsor or any other entity and calculate the Ending Level as described above. Upon any selection by the Calculation Agent of a Successor Commodity Index, the Company will cause notice to be given to the Holder of this Security.
Successor Commodity Index
In the event that the Index Sponsor discontinues publication of the Index and the Calculation Agent does not select a Successor Commodity Index, the Calculation Agent will compute a substitute level for the Index in accordance with the procedures last used to calculate the Index before any discontinuance. If a Successor Commodity Index is selected or the Calculation Agent calculates a level as a substitute for the Index, the Successor Commodity Index or level will be used as a substitute for the Index for all purposes, including the purpose of determining whether a Market Disruption Event exists.
 
If at any time the Index Sponsor makes a material change in the formula for or the method of calculating the Index, or in any other way materially modifies the Index so that the Index does not, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent, fairly represent the level of the Index had those changes or modifications not been made, then, from and after that time, the Calculation Agent will, at the close of business in New York, New York, on the date that the Closing Level of the Index is to be calculated, make any adjustments as, in the good faith judgment of the Calculation Agent, may be necessary in order to arrive at a value of an commodity index comparable to the Index as if those changes or modifications had not been made, and calculate the level of the Index with reference to such commodity index, as so adjusted. Accordingly, if the method of calculating the Index is modified so that the level of the Index is a fraction or a multiple of what it would have been if it had not been modified, then the Calculation Agent will adjust the Index in order to arrive at a level of the Index as if it had not been modified.
Market Disruption Events

Market Disruption Event

Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

For purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred:
 
 
 
Anti-dilution Adjustments Relating To A Basket Component; Alternate Calculation
Anti-dilution Adjustments
The Calculation Agent, in its sole discretion, may adjust the Adjustment Factor as a result of certain events related to a Basket Component or any Successor Fund, as applicable, which occur during the term of this Security. Such events include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
If a stock split or reverse stock split has occurred, then once such split has become effective, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the number of securities which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component before the effective date of such stock split or reverse stock split would have owned or been entitled to receive immediately following the applicable effective date.
 
If a (i) stock dividend (i.e., issuance of additional shares (or other applicable security) by a Basket Component) that is given ratably to all holders of record of shares (or other applicable security) of a Basket Component or (ii) distribution of shares (or other applicable security) of a Basket Component has occurred, then once the dividend has become effective and the shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component are trading ex-dividend, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted on the ex-dividend date to equal the prior Adjustment Factor plus the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the number of shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component before the date the dividend became effective and the shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component traded ex-dividend would have owned or been entitled to receive immediately following that date; provided, however, that no adjustment will be made for a distribution for which the number of securities of such Basket Component paid or distributed is based on a fixed cash equivalent value, unless such distribution is an Extraordinary Dividend as defined and discussed below.
 
If an Extraordinary Dividend (as defined below) has occurred, then on the ex-dividend date, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and a fraction, the numerator of which is the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date, and the denominator of which is the amount by which the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date exceeds the Extraordinary Dividend Amount (as defined below).
 
For purposes of determining whether an Extraordinary Dividend has occurred:
 
 
 
 
To the extent an Extraordinary Dividend is not paid in cash, the value of the non-cash component will be determined by the Calculation Agent. A distribution on the securities of such Basket Component described below under the sections entitled "Other Distributions" and "Reorganization Events" below that also constitute an Extraordinary Dividend will only cause an adjustment pursuant to those sections.
 
If a Basket Component declares or makes a distribution to all holders of the shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component of any class of its capital stock, evidences of its indebtedness or other non-cash assets, including, but not limited to, transferable rights and warrants, then, in each of these cases, the Adjustment Factor will equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and a fraction, the numerator of which will be the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component, and the denominator of which will be the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket
 
Component, less the fair market value, as determined by the Calculation Agent, as of the time the adjustment is effected of the portion of the capital shares, assets, evidences of indebtedness, rights or warrants so distributed or issued applicable to one share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component.
 
If a Basket Component, or any Successor Fund, is subject to a merger, combination, consolidation or statutory exchange of securities with another exchange traded fund, and such Basket Component is not the surviving entity, then, on or after the date of such event, the Calculation Agent shall, in its sole discretion, make an adjustment to the Adjustment Factor or the method of determining the Redemption Amount or any other terms of this Security as the Calculation Agent determines appropriate to account for the economic effect on this Security of such event (including adjustments to account for changes in volatility, expected dividends, stock loan rate or liquidity relevant to this Security), and determine the effective date of that adjustment. If the Calculation Agent determines that no adjustment that it could make will produce a commercially reasonable result, then the Calculation Agent may deem such event a Liquidation Event (as defined below).
Liquidation Events
If a Basket Component is de-listed, liquidated or otherwise terminated (a ""), and a successor or substitute exchange traded fund exists that the Calculation Agent determines, in its sole discretion, to be comparable to such Basket Component, then, upon the Calculation Agent's notification of that determination to the Trustee and the Company, any subsequent Fund Closing Price for such Basket Component will be determined by reference to the Fund Closing Price of such successor or substitute exchange traded fund (such exchange traded fund being referred to herein as a "").
Liquidation Event
Successor Fund
Upon any selection by the Calculation Agent of a Successor Fund, the Company will cause notice to be given to Holder of this Security.
If a Basket Component undergoes a Liquidation Event prior to, and such Liquidation Event is continuing on, the date that the Fund Closing Price of such Basket Component is to be determined and the Calculation Agent determines that no Successor Fund is available at such time, then the Calculation Agent will, in its discretion, calculate the Fund Closing Price for such Basket Component on such date by a computation methodology that the Calculation Agent determines will as closely as reasonably possible replicate such Basket Component.
If a Successor Fund is selected or the Calculation Agent calculates the Fund Closing Price as a substitute for a Basket Component, such Successor Fund or Fund Closing Price will be used as a substitute for such Basket Component for all purposes, including for purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event exists.
 
If at any time the method of calculating a Basket Component or a Successor Fund, or the related Underlying Index, is changed in a material respect, or if a Basket Component or a Successor Fund is in any other way modified so that such Basket Component does not, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent, fairly represent the price of the securities of such Basket Component or such Successor Fund had such changes or modifications not been made, then the Calculation Agent will, at the close of business in New York City on the date that the Fund Closing Price is to be determined, make such calculations and adjustments as, in the good faith judgment of the Calculation Agent, may be necessary in order to arrive at a Closing Price of an exchange traded fund comparable to such Basket Component or Successor Fund, as the case may be, as if such changes or modifications had not been made, and calculate the Fund Closing Price and the Redemption Amount with reference to such adjusted Closing Price of such Basket Component or such Successor Fund, as applicable.
Calculation Agent
The Calculation Agent will determine the Redemption Amount and the Ending Price. In addition, the Calculation Agent will (i) determine if adjustments are required to the Fund Closing Price and/or the Adjustment Factor of a Basket Component under the circumstances described in this Security, (ii) if a Basket Component undergoes a Liquidation Event, select a Successor Fund or, if no Successor Fund is available, determine the Fund Closing Price of such Basket Component, and (iii) determine whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred.
The Company covenants that, so long as this Security is Outstanding, there shall at all times be a Calculation Agent (which shall be a broker-dealer, bank or other financial institution) with respect to this Security.
All determinations made by the Calculation Agent with respect to this Security will be at the sole discretion of the Calculation Agent and, in the absence of manifest error, will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the Holder of this Security. All percentages and other amounts resulting from any calculation with respect to this Security will be rounded at the Calculation Agent's discretion.
Tax Considerations
The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a beneficial ownership interest in this Security each Holder of this Security will be deemed to have agreed (in the absence of a statutory, regulatory, administrative or judicial ruling to the contrary), for United States federal income tax purposes to characterize and treat this Security as a pre-paid derivative contract in respect of the Basket.
Redemption and Repayment
This Security is not subject to redemption at the option of the Company or repayment at the option of the Holder hereof prior to January 7, 2016. This Security is not entitled to any sinking fund.
 
Acceleration
If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to this Security shall occur and be continuing, the Redemption Amount (calculated as set forth in the next sentence) of this Security may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The amount payable to the Holder hereof upon any acceleration permitted under the Indenture will be equal to the Redemption Amount hereof calculated as provided herein as though the date of acceleration was the Calculation Day; provided, however, if such date is not a Trading Day or if a Market Disruption Event has occurred or is continuing on that day, the Calculation Day will be postponed as provided herein.
 
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature or its duly authorized agent under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

Market Disruption Event
 
 
 
 
 
 
For purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred:
 
 
 
Anti-dilution Adjustments Relating To A Basket Component; Alternate Calculation
Anti-dilution Adjustments
The Calculation Agent, in its sole discretion, may adjust the Adjustment Factor as a result of certain events related to a Basket Component or any Successor Fund, as applicable, which occur during the term of this Security. Such events include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
If a stock split or reverse stock split has occurred, then once such split has become effective, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the number of securities which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component before the effective date of such stock split or reverse stock split would have owned or been entitled to receive immediately following the applicable effective date.
 
If a (i) stock dividend (i.e., issuance of additional shares (or other applicable security) by a Basket Component) that is given ratably to all holders of record of shares (or other applicable security) of a Basket Component or (ii) distribution of shares (or other applicable security) of a Basket Component has occurred, then once the dividend has become effective and the shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component are trading ex-dividend, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted on the ex-dividend date to equal the prior Adjustment Factor plus the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the number of shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component before the date the dividend became effective and the shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component traded ex-dividend would have owned or been entitled to receive immediately following that date; provided, however, that no adjustment will be made for a distribution for which the number of securities of such Basket Component paid or distributed is based on a fixed cash equivalent value, unless such distribution is an Extraordinary Dividend as defined and discussed below.
 
If an Extraordinary Dividend (as defined below) has occurred, then on the ex-dividend date, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and a fraction, the numerator of which is the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date, and the denominator of which is the amount by which the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date exceeds the Extraordinary Dividend Amount (as defined below).
 
For purposes of determining whether an Extraordinary Dividend has occurred:
 
 
 
 
To the extent an Extraordinary Dividend is not paid in cash, the value of the non-cash component will be determined by the Calculation Agent. A distribution on the securities of such Basket Component described below under the sections entitled "Other Distributions" and "Reorganization Events" below that also constitute an Extraordinary Dividend will only cause an adjustment pursuant to those sections.
 
If a Basket Component declares or makes a distribution to all holders of the shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component of any class of its capital stock, evidences of its indebtedness or other non-cash assets, including, but not limited to, transferable rights and warrants, then, in each of these cases, the Adjustment Factor will equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and a fraction, the numerator of which will be the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component, and the denominator of which will be the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket
 
Component, less the fair market value, as determined by the Calculation Agent, as of the time the adjustment is effected of the portion of the capital shares, assets, evidences of indebtedness, rights or warrants so distributed or issued applicable to one share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component.
 
If a Basket Component, or any Successor Fund, is subject to a merger, combination, consolidation or statutory exchange of securities with another exchange traded fund, and such Basket Component is not the surviving entity, then, on or after the date of such event, the Calculation Agent shall, in its sole discretion, make an adjustment to the Adjustment Factor or the method of determining the Redemption Amount or any other terms of this Security as the Calculation Agent determines appropriate to account for the economic effect on this Security of such event (including adjustments to account for changes in volatility, expected dividends, stock loan rate or liquidity relevant to this Security), and determine the effective date of that adjustment. If the Calculation Agent determines that no adjustment that it could make will produce a commercially reasonable result, then the Calculation Agent may deem such event a Liquidation Event (as defined below).
Liquidation Events
If a Basket Component is de-listed, liquidated or otherwise terminated (a ""), and a successor or substitute exchange traded fund exists that the Calculation Agent determines, in its sole discretion, to be comparable to such Basket Component, then, upon the Calculation Agent's notification of that determination to the Trustee and the Company, any subsequent Fund Closing Price for such Basket Component will be determined by reference to the Fund Closing Price of such successor or substitute exchange traded fund (such exchange traded fund being referred to herein as a "").
Liquidation Event
Successor Fund
Upon any selection by the Calculation Agent of a Successor Fund, the Company will cause notice to be given to Holder of this Security.
If a Basket Component undergoes a Liquidation Event prior to, and such Liquidation Event is continuing on, the date that the Fund Closing Price of such Basket Component is to be determined and the Calculation Agent determines that no Successor Fund is available at such time, then the Calculation Agent will, in its discretion, calculate the Fund Closing Price for such Basket Component on such date by a computation methodology that the Calculation Agent determines will as closely as reasonably possible replicate such Basket Component.
If a Successor Fund is selected or the Calculation Agent calculates the Fund Closing Price as a substitute for a Basket Component, such Successor Fund or Fund Closing Price will be used as a substitute for such Basket Component for all purposes, including for purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event exists.
 
If at any time the method of calculating a Basket Component or a Successor Fund, or the related Underlying Index, is changed in a material respect, or if a Basket Component or a Successor Fund is in any other way modified so that such Basket Component does not, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent, fairly represent the price of the securities of such Basket Component or such Successor Fund had such changes or modifications not been made, then the Calculation Agent will, at the close of business in New York City on the date that the Fund Closing Price is to be determined, make such calculations and adjustments as, in the good faith judgment of the Calculation Agent, may be necessary in order to arrive at a Closing Price of an exchange traded fund comparable to such Basket Component or Successor Fund, as the case may be, as if such changes or modifications had not been made, and calculate the Fund Closing Price and the Redemption Amount with reference to such adjusted Closing Price of such Basket Component or such Successor Fund, as applicable.
Calculation Agent
The Calculation Agent will determine the Redemption Amount and the Ending Price. In addition, the Calculation Agent will (i) determine if adjustments are required to the Fund Closing Price and/or the Adjustment Factor of a Basket Component under the circumstances described in this Security, (ii) if a Basket Component undergoes a Liquidation Event, select a Successor Fund or, if no Successor Fund is available, determine the Fund Closing Price of such Basket Component, and (iii) determine whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred.
The Company covenants that, so long as this Security is Outstanding, there shall at all times be a Calculation Agent (which shall be a broker-dealer, bank or other financial institution) with respect to this Security.
All determinations made by the Calculation Agent with respect to this Security will be at the sole discretion of the Calculation Agent and, in the absence of manifest error, will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the Holder of this Security. All percentages and other amounts resulting from any calculation with respect to this Security will be rounded at the Calculation Agent's discretion.
Tax Considerations
The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a beneficial ownership interest in this Security each Holder of this Security will be deemed to have agreed (in the absence of a statutory, regulatory, administrative or judicial ruling to the contrary), for United States federal income tax purposes to characterize and treat this Security as a pre-paid derivative contract in respect of the Basket.
Redemption and Repayment
This Security is not subject to redemption at the option of the Company or repayment at the option of the Holder hereof prior to January 7, 2016. This Security is not entitled to any sinking fund.
 
Acceleration
If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to this Security shall occur and be continuing, the Redemption Amount (calculated as set forth in the next sentence) of this Security may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The amount payable to the Holder hereof upon any acceleration permitted under the Indenture will be equal to the Redemption Amount hereof calculated as provided herein as though the date of acceleration was the Calculation Day; provided, however, if such date is not a Trading Day or if a Market Disruption Event has occurred or is continuing on that day, the Calculation Day will be postponed as provided herein.
 
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature or its duly authorized agent under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

A "" means, with respect to the Fund, any of the following events as determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion:
Market Disruption Event
 
 
 
 
 
For purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred:
 
 
Anti-dilution Adjustments Relating to the Fund; Alternate Calculation
Anti-dilution Adjustments
The Calculation Agent, in its sole discretion, may adjust the Adjustment Factor as a result of certain events related to the Fund or any Successor Fund, as applicable, which occur during the term of this Security. Such events include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
If a stock split or reverse stock split has occurred, then once such split has become effective, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the number of securities which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of the Fund before the effective date of such stock split or reverse stock split would have owned or been entitled to receive immediately following the applicable effective date.
 
If a (i) stock dividend (i.e., issuance of additional shares (or other applicable security) by the Fund) that is given ratably to all holders of record of shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund or (ii) distribution of shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund has occurred, then once the dividend has become effective and the shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund are trading ex-dividend, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted on the ex-dividend date to equal the prior Adjustment Factor plus the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the number of shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of the Fund before the date the dividend became effective and the shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund traded ex-dividend would have owned or been entitled to receive immediately following that date; provided, however, that no adjustment will be made for a distribution for which the number of securities of the Fund paid or distributed is based on a fixed cash equivalent value, unless such distribution is an Extraordinary Dividend as defined and discussed below.
 
If an Extraordinary Dividend (as defined below) has occurred, then on the ex-dividend date, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and a fraction, the numerator of which is the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of the Fund on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date, and the denominator of which is the amount by
 
which the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of the Fund on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date exceeds the Extraordinary Dividend Amount (as defined below).
For purposes of determining whether an Extraordinary Dividend has occurred:
 
 
 
 
To the extent an Extraordinary Dividend is not paid in cash, the value of the non-cash component will be determined by the Calculation Agent. A distribution on the securities of the Fund described below under the sections entitled "Other Distributions" and "Reorganization Events" below that also constitute an Extraordinary Dividend will only cause an adjustment pursuant to those sections.
 
If the Fund declares or makes a distribution to all holders of the shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund of any class of its capital stock, evidences of its indebtedness or other non-cash assets, including, but not limited to, transferable rights and warrants, then, in each of these cases, the Adjustment Factor will equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and a fraction, the numerator of which will be the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of the Fund, and the denominator of which will be the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of the Fund, less the fair market value, as determined by the Calculation
 
Agent, as of the time the adjustment is effected of the portion of the capital shares, assets, evidences of indebtedness, rights or warrants so distributed or issued applicable to one share (or other applicable security) of the Fund.
 
If the Fund, or any Successor Fund, is subject to a merger, combination, consolidation or statutory exchange of securities with another exchange traded fund, and the Fund is not the surviving entity, then, on or after the date of such event, the Calculation Agent shall, in its sole discretion, make an adjustment to the Adjustment Factor or the method of determining the Redemption Amount or any other terms of this Security as the Calculation Agent determines appropriate to account for the economic effect on this Security of such event (including adjustments to account for changes in volatility, expected dividends, stock loan rate or liquidity relevant to this Security), and determine the effective date of that adjustment. If the Calculation Agent determines that no adjustment that it could make will produce a commercially reasonable result, then the Calculation Agent may deem such event a Liquidation Event (as defined below).
Liquidation Events
If the Fund is de-listed, liquidated or otherwise terminated (a ""), and a successor or substitute exchange traded fund exists that the Calculation Agent determines, in its sole discretion, to be comparable to the Fund, then, upon the Calculation Agent's notification of that determination to the Trustee and the Company, any subsequent Fund Closing Price for the Fund will be determined by reference to the Fund Closing Price of such successor or substitute exchange traded fund (such exchange traded fund being referred to herein as a "").
Liquidation Event
Successor Fund
Upon any selection by the Calculation Agent of a Successor Fund, the Company will cause notice to be given to Holder of this Security.
If the Fund undergoes a Liquidation Event prior to, and such Liquidation Event is continuing on, the date that the Fund Closing Price of the Fund is to be determined and the Calculation Agent determines that no Successor Fund is available at such time, then the Calculation Agent will, in its discretion, calculate the Fund Closing Price for the Fund on such date by a computation methodology that the Calculation Agent determines will as closely as reasonably possible replicate the Fund.
If a Successor Fund is selected or the Calculation Agent calculates the Fund Closing Price as a substitute for the Fund, such Successor Fund or Fund Closing Price will be used as a substitute for the Fund for all purposes, including for purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event exists.
If at any time the method of calculating the Fund or a Successor Fund, or the MSCI Emerging Markets Index (the index underlying the Fund), is changed in a material respect, or if
 
the Fund or a Successor Fund is in any other way modified so that the Fund does not, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent, fairly represent the price of the securities of the Fund or such Successor Fund had such changes or modifications not been made, then the Calculation Agent will, at the close of business in New York City on the date that the Fund Closing Price is to be determined, make such calculations and adjustments as, in the good faith judgment of the Calculation Agent, may be necessary in order to arrive at a Closing Price of an exchange traded fund comparable to the Fund or such Successor Fund, as the case may be, as if such changes or modifications had not been made, and calculate the Fund Closing Price and the Redemption Amount with reference to such adjusted Closing Price of the Fund or such Successor Fund, as applicable.
Calculation Agent
The Calculation Agent will determine the Redemption Amount and the Ending Price. In addition, the Calculation Agent will (i) determine if adjustments are required to the Fund Closing Price and/or the Adjustment Factor under the circumstances described in this Security, (ii) if the Fund undergoes a Liquidation Event, select a Successor Fund or, if no Successor Fund is available, determine the Fund Closing Price of the Fund, and (iii) determine whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred.
The Company covenants that, so long as this Security is Outstanding, there shall at all times be a Calculation Agent (which shall be a broker-dealer, bank or other financial institution) with respect to this Security.
All determinations made by the Calculation Agent with respect to this Security will be at the sole discretion of the Calculation Agent and, in the absence of manifest error, will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the Holder of this Security. All percentages and other amounts resulting from any calculation with respect to this Security will be rounded at the Calculation Agent's discretion.
Tax Considerations
The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a beneficial ownership interest in this Security each Holder of this Security will be deemed to have agreed (in the absence of a statutory, regulatory, administrative or judicial ruling to the contrary), for United States federal income tax purposes to characterize and treat this Security as a pre-paid derivative contract in respect of the Fund.
Redemption and Repayment
This Security is not subject to redemption at the option of the Company or repayment at the option of the Holder hereof prior to January 7, 2015. This Security is not entitled to any sinking fund.
Acceleration
If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to this Security shall occur and be continuing, the Redemption Amount (calculated as set forth in the next sentence) of this
 
Security may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The amount payable to the Holder hereof upon any acceleration permitted under the Indenture will be equal to the Redemption Amount hereof calculated as provided herein as though the date of acceleration was the Calculation Day; provided, however, if such date is not a Trading Day or if a Market Disruption Event has occurred or is continuing on that day, the Calculation Day will be postponed as provided herein.
 
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature or its duly authorized agent under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

Certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences may be waived under the Indenture by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series. Solely for the purpose of determining whether any consent, waiver, notice or other action or Act to be taken or given by the Holders of Securities pursuant to the Indenture has been given or taken by the Holders of Outstanding Securities in the requisite aggregate principal amount, the principal amount of this Security will be deemed to be equal to the amount set forth on the face hereof as the "Face Amount" hereof. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

Calculation Agent
 
Market Disruption Events
A "" means, with respect to the Fund, any of the following events as determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion:
Market Disruption Event
 
 
 
 
 
For purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred:
 
 
Anti-dilution Adjustments Relating to the Fund; Alternate Calculation
Anti-dilution Adjustments
The Calculation Agent, in its sole discretion, may adjust the Adjustment Factor as a result of certain events related to the Fund or any Successor Fund, as applicable, which occur during the term of this Security. Such events include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
If a stock split or reverse stock split has occurred, then once such split has become effective, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the number of securities which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of the Fund before the effective date of such stock split or reverse stock split would have owned or been entitled to receive immediately following the applicable effective date.
 
If a (i) stock dividend (i.e., issuance of additional shares (or other applicable security) by the Fund) that is given ratably to all holders of record of shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund or (ii) distribution of shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund has occurred, then once the dividend has become effective and the shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund are trading ex-dividend, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted on the ex-dividend date to equal the prior Adjustment Factor plus the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the number of shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of the Fund before the date the dividend became effective and the shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund traded ex-dividend would have owned or been entitled to receive immediately following that date; provided, however, that no adjustment will be made for a distribution for which the number of securities of the Fund paid or distributed is based on a fixed cash equivalent value, unless such distribution is an Extraordinary Dividend as defined and discussed below.
 
If an Extraordinary Dividend (as defined below) has occurred, then on the ex-dividend date, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and a fraction, the numerator of which is the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of the Fund on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date, and the denominator of which is the amount by
 
which the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of the Fund on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date exceeds the Extraordinary Dividend Amount (as defined below).
For purposes of determining whether an Extraordinary Dividend has occurred:
 
 
 
 
To the extent an Extraordinary Dividend is not paid in cash, the value of the non-cash component will be determined by the Calculation Agent. A distribution on the securities of the Fund described below under the sections entitled "Other Distributions" and "Reorganization Events" below that also constitute an Extraordinary Dividend will only cause an adjustment pursuant to those sections.
 
If the Fund declares or makes a distribution to all holders of the shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund of any class of its capital stock, evidences of its indebtedness or other non-cash assets, including, but not limited to, transferable rights and warrants, then, in each of these cases, the Adjustment Factor will equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and a fraction, the numerator of which will be the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of the Fund, and the denominator of which will be the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of the Fund, less the fair market value, as determined by the Calculation
 
Agent, as of the time the adjustment is effected of the portion of the capital shares, assets, evidences of indebtedness, rights or warrants so distributed or issued applicable to one share (or other applicable security) of the Fund.
 
If the Fund, or any Successor Fund, is subject to a merger, combination, consolidation or statutory exchange of securities with another exchange traded fund, and the Fund is not the surviving entity, then, on or after the date of such event, the Calculation Agent shall, in its sole discretion, make an adjustment to the Adjustment Factor or the method of determining the Redemption Amount or any other terms of this Security as the Calculation Agent determines appropriate to account for the economic effect on this Security of such event (including adjustments to account for changes in volatility, expected dividends, stock loan rate or liquidity relevant to this Security), and determine the effective date of that adjustment. If the Calculation Agent determines that no adjustment that it could make will produce a commercially reasonable result, then the Calculation Agent may deem such event a Liquidation Event (as defined below).
Liquidation Events
If the Fund is de-listed, liquidated or otherwise terminated (a ""), and a successor or substitute exchange traded fund exists that the Calculation Agent determines, in its sole discretion, to be comparable to the Fund, then, upon the Calculation Agent's notification of that determination to the Trustee and the Company, any subsequent Fund Closing Price for the Fund will be determined by reference to the Fund Closing Price of such successor or substitute exchange traded fund (such exchange traded fund being referred to herein as a "").
Liquidation Event
Successor Fund
Upon any selection by the Calculation Agent of a Successor Fund, the Company will cause notice to be given to Holder of this Security.
If the Fund undergoes a Liquidation Event prior to, and such Liquidation Event is continuing on, the date that the Fund Closing Price of the Fund is to be determined and the Calculation Agent determines that no Successor Fund is available at such time, then the Calculation Agent will, in its discretion, calculate the Fund Closing Price for the Fund on such date by a computation methodology that the Calculation Agent determines will as closely as reasonably possible replicate the Fund.
If a Successor Fund is selected or the Calculation Agent calculates the Fund Closing Price as a substitute for the Fund, such Successor Fund or Fund Closing Price will be used as a substitute for the Fund for all purposes, including for purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event exists.
If at any time the method of calculating the Fund or a Successor Fund, or the Russell 2000 Index (the index underlying the Fund), is changed in a material respect, or if the Fund or a
 
Successor Fund is in any other way modified so that the Fund does not, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent, fairly represent the price of the securities of the Fund or such Successor Fund had such changes or modifications not been made, then the Calculation Agent will, at the close of business in New York City on the date that the Fund Closing Price is to be determined, make such calculations and adjustments as, in the good faith judgment of the Calculation Agent, may be necessary in order to arrive at a Closing Price of an exchange traded fund comparable to the Fund or such Successor Fund, as the case may be, as if such changes or modifications had not been made, and calculate the Fund Closing Price and the Redemption Amount with reference to such adjusted Closing Price of the Fund or such Successor Fund, as applicable.
Calculation Agent
The Calculation Agent will determine the Redemption Amount and the Ending Price. In addition, the Calculation Agent will (i) determine if adjustments are required to the Fund Closing Price and/or the Adjustment Factor under the circumstances described in this Security, (ii) if the Fund undergoes a Liquidation Event, select a Successor Fund or, if no Successor Fund is available, determine the Fund Closing Price of the Fund, and (iii) determine whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred.
The Company covenants that, so long as this Security is Outstanding, there shall at all times be a Calculation Agent (which shall be a broker-dealer, bank or other financial institution) with respect to this Security.
All determinations made by the Calculation Agent with respect to this Security will be at the sole discretion of the Calculation Agent and, in the absence of manifest error, will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the Holder of this Security. All percentages and other amounts resulting from any calculation with respect to this Security will be rounded at the Calculation Agent's discretion.
Tax Considerations
The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a beneficial ownership interest in this Security each Holder of this Security will be deemed to have agreed (in the absence of a statutory, regulatory, administrative or judicial ruling to the contrary), for United States federal income tax purposes to characterize and treat this Security as a pre-paid derivative contract in respect of the Fund.
Redemption and Repayment
This Security is not subject to redemption at the option of the Company or repayment at the option of the Holder hereof prior to January 7, 2014. This Security is not entitled to any sinking fund.
Acceleration

Indenture. The amount payable to the Holder hereof upon any acceleration permitted under the Indenture will be equal to the Redemption Amount hereof calculated as provided herein as though the date of acceleration was the Calculation Day; provided, however, if such date is not a Trading Day or if a Market Disruption Event has occurred or is continuing on that day, the Calculation Day will be postponed as provided herein.
 
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature or its duly authorized agent under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

As contemplated by the foregoing qualifications, in rendering the foregoing opinion, we are expressing no opinion as to Federal or state laws relating to fraudulent transfers. Without limiting any other qualifications set forth herein, the opinions expressed herein are subject to the effect of generally applicable laws that limit the waiver of rights under usury laws.

We have also relied, without investigation, upon the following assumptions: (i) natural persons acting on behalf of the Company have sufficient legal capacity to enter into and perform, on behalf of the Company, the transaction in question; (ii) each party to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreements or instruments enforceable against it; (iii) each party to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company has complied with all legal requirements pertaining to its status as such status relates to its rights to enforce such agreements or instruments against the Company; and (iv) each document submitted to us for review is accurate and complete, each such document that is an original is authentic, each such document that is a copy conforms to an authentic original, and all signatures on each such document are genuine.
The opinions expressed herein are limited to the specific issues addressed and to documents and laws existing on the date hereof. By rendering our opinion, we do not undertake to advise you with respect to any other matter or of any change in such documents and laws or in the interpretation thereof which may occur after the date hereof.
