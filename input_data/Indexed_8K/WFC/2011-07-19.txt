Selected Financial Information
 
SAN FRANCISCO  Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC) reported record net income of $3.9 billion, or $0.70 per diluted common share, for second quarter 2011, up from $3.1 billion, or $0.55 per share, for second quarter 2010 and up from $3.8 billion, or $0.67 per share, for first quarter 2011.
"Our business fundamentals were strong with increased revenues, loans and deposits, lower operating costs, improved credit quality and higher capital levels," said Chairman and CEO John Stumpf. "While the economic recovery continues to be slower than expected, there are signs that businesses are investing for growth, and we're here to help them. We're enjoying strong loyalty and market share growth as we continue to focus on helping our customers emerge from the economic downturn. We're right on track with our integration, having converted 2,215 Wachovia stores to date, including most recently one of our largest East Coast states, Florida. We continue to be focused on building and managing our diversified company for the long-term benefit of our team members, customers, shareholders and communities and feel we are very well positioned to capture future growth opportunities."
Revenue was $20.4 billion, compared with $20.3 billion in first quarter 2011. Businesses generating double-digit linked-quarter annualized revenue growth included corporate banking, commercial real estate, debit card, insurance, international, merchant services, retirement services and SBA lending. "We are pleased with

the increased revenue in the quarter, reflecting the stability in loan balances and overall strength of our diversified sources of fee income," said Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan.
Net interest income was $10.7 billion, up $27 million from first quarter 2011. Average earning assets increased $10 billion from first quarter 2011, driven by growth in short-term investments and high-quality shorter-duration available for sale securities. Excluding the planned runoff of non-strategic/liquidating portfolios, average loan balances increased from the prior quarter. Continued success in generating low-cost deposits enabled the Company to grow assets while reducing long-term debt, including the redemption of higher-yielding trust preferred securities. Lower cost funding was the primary driver of the increase in net interest income on a linked-quarter basis. Higher short-term investment balances contributed to the slight margin decline from 4.05 percent in first quarter 2011 to 4.01 percent in second quarter.
Net Interest Income
1
Noninterest income was $9.7 billion, up $30 million from first quarter 2011. On a linked-quarter basis, deposit service charges increased 6 percent due to seasonal increases in customer spending and customer account growth. Card fees were up 5 percent from first quarter 2011 on higher debit and credit card spending volumes and new customer account growth. Insurance fees increased 13 percent linked quarter primarily due to seasonally higher crop insurance sales. Gains on trading assets were down due to softer equity and fixed income market conditions but were more than offset by higher gains from equity investments. "Second quarter performance was notable for the diversity of sources of growth and the resilience of non-mortgage banking fee income, up $427 million from first quarter to our highest level since the merger with Wachovia," said Sloan.
Noninterest Income
Mortgage banking noninterest income was $1.6 billion, down $397 million from first quarter 2011 on $64 billion of originations compared with $84 billion of originations in first quarter. Mortgage banking noninterest income in second quarter included a $242 million provision for mortgage loan repurchase losses compared with $249 million in first quarter (included in net gains from mortgage loan origination/sales activities). Net mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) results were a $374 million gain compared with a $379 million gain in first quarter 2011. The ratio of MSRs to related loans serviced for others was 87 basis points and the average note rate on the servicing portfolio was 5.26 percent, compared with an average 4.51 percent published rate in the Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey at quarter end. The unclosed pipeline at June 30, 2011, was $51 billion compared with $45 billion at March 31, 2011.
The Company had net unrealized securities gains of $9.3 billion at June 30, 2011, up $397 million from first quarter 2011. Period-end securities available for sale balances were up $18.4 billion, reflecting increased investment activity in second quarter.
Non-strategic/liquidating portfolios include Pick-a-Pay, liquidating home equity, legacy Wells Fargo Financial indirect auto and debt consolidation, education finance government loans and other PCI loans.

Noninterest expense was $12.5 billion, down $258 million from first quarter 2011. Second quarter expenses included $484 million of merger integration costs (up from $440 million in first quarter 2011 on increased integration activity in second quarter), and $428 million of operating losses (down from $472 million in first quarter 2011), substantially all for litigation accruals for mortgage foreclosure-related matters. "Merger costs remained within expectations and we are beginning to see positive results from our expense management initiatives," said Sloan. "While we are still in the early stages of this effort, we expect meaningful cost savings over time, and are targeting $11 billion of noninterest expense for fourth quarter 2012."
Noninterest Expense

Total loans were $751.9 billion at June 30, 2011, up $766 million from $751.2 billion at March 31, 2011. Increased balances in many commercial loan portfolios more than offset the continued planned reduction in the non-strategic/liquidating portfolios, which declined $5.1 billion in the quarter compared with a $6.5 billion decline in first quarter 2011. Many portfolios had double-digit linked quarter annualized growth in average loan balances, including asset-backed finance, capital finance, commercial banking, commercial real estate, government banking, insurance, international, and real estate capital markets.
Loans
Average core deposits were $807.5 billion, up 6 percent from a year ago and up 5 percent (annualized) from first quarter 2011. Consumer checking accounts grew a net 7.0 percent from June 30, 2010. Average core checking and savings deposits were $735.4 billion, up 9 percent from a year ago and up 7 percent (annualized) from first quarter 2011. Average mortgage escrow deposits were $23.9 billion compared with $25.7 billion a year ago and $27.9 billion in first quarter 2011. Average checking and savings deposits were 91 percent of average core deposits, up from 88 percent a year ago. The average deposit cost for second quarter 2011 was 28 basis points compared with 30 basis points in first quarter 2011. Average core deposits were 107 percent of average loans.
Deposits

Capital increased in the second quarter, with Tier 1 common equity reaching 9.2 percent. Under current Basel III proposals, the Tier 1 common equity ratio was an estimated 7.4 percent. The Company redeemed $3.4 billion of trust preferred securities, repurchased 35 million shares of its common stock and paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.12 per share.
Capital
"Credit quality continued to improve in the second quarter, our sixth consecutive quarter of declining loan losses and the third consecutive quarter of lower nonperforming assets," said Mike Loughlin, Chief Risk Officer. Second quarter net charge-offs were $2.8 billion, or 1.52 percent (annualized) of average loans, down $372 million from first quarter net charge-offs of $3.2 billion (1.73 percent). The decline in net charge-offs was driven by lower losses in virtually every loan category and delinquency trends continued to show improvement. Reflecting the improved overall portfolio performance, the provision for credit losses was $1.0 billion less than net charge-offs. "Absent significant deterioration in the economy, we expect future reserve releases," said Loughlin.

Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets ended the quarter at $27.9 billion, down 8 percent from $30.5 billion in the first quarter. Nonaccrual loans declined to $23.0 billion from $25.0 billion in the first quarter, with reductions across all major loan portfolios. Foreclosed assets decreased 12 percent to $4.9 billion, the third consecutive quarterly decline despite extended foreclosure timelines in many states. A significant portion of the reduction in commercial nonperforming loans resulted from loans that returned to performing status, loan payoffs and loan sales, reflecting an improved credit landscape and market liquidity. Similarly, the reduction in consumer nonperforming loans was driven in part by an asset sale, increased success in home modifications and increased short sale activity.
Nonperforming Assets (Nonaccrual Loans and Foreclosed Assets)
 
Loans 90 Days or More Past Due and Still Accruing
Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing also improved in the quarter, totaling $17.3 billion at June 30, 2011, compared with $17.9 billion at March 31, 2011. Loans whose repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration or predominantly guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs for mortgages and the U.S. Department of Education for student loans under the Federal Family Education Loan Program were $15.5 billion at June 30, 2011, flat from first quarter. All other loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing balances declined 25 percent from the prior quarter.
 
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for unfunded commitments, totaled $21.3 billion at June 30, 2011, down from $22.4 billion at March 31, 2011. The allowance coverage to total loans was 2.83 percent compared with 2.98 percent in the prior quarter. The allowance covered 1.87 times annualized second quarter net charge-offs compared with 1.72 times in the prior quarter. The allowance coverage to nonaccrual loans was 92 percent at June 30, 2011, compared with 90 percent at March 31, 2011. "We believe the allowance was adequate for losses inherent in the loan portfolio at June 30, 2011," said Loughlin.

offers a complete line of diversified financial products and services for consumers and small businesses including investment, insurance and trust services in 39 states and D.C., and mortgage and home equity loans in all 50 states and D.C. through its Regional Banking and Wells Fargo Home Mortgage business units.
Selected Financial Information
 
Community Banking reported net income of $2.1 billion, down $88 million, or 4 percent, from prior quarter and up $371 million, or 22 percent, from second quarter 2010. Revenue decreased $70 million from first quarter 2011 driven primarily by a decline in mortgage banking income from lower originations and continued expected reductions in the home equity loan portfolio, offset by gains on equity investments and lower deposit costs. Revenue decreased $1.0 billion, or 8 percent, from second quarter 2010 largely due to
 
lower mortgage banking income, lower deposit service charges as a result of Regulation E and the expected reduction in the liquidating loan portfolios, partially offset by the impact of a robust used car market on the indirect auto portfolio, strong debit card growth and equity gains. Noninterest expense decreased $187 million, or 2 percent, from first quarter 2011, reflecting improved credit costs, as well as lower software license and other equipment expense. Noninterest expense decreased $260 million, or 3 percent, from second quarter 2010 due to reduced personnel costs, a decrease in software license expense and lower operating losses. The provision for credit losses decreased $138 million from first quarter 2011 and $1.4 billion from second quarter 2010. The decline was due to a $288 million decrease in net loan charge-offs from first quarter 2011, a $1.1 billion decrease from second quarter 2010, as well as a $700 million reserve release in second quarter 2011, compared with a release of $850 million and $389 million in first quarter 2011 and second quarter 2010, respectively.

Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Information
In accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we caution you that this news release contains forward-looking statements about our future financial performance and business. We make forward-looking statements when we use words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "target," "should," "may," "can," "will," "outlook," "project," "appears" or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements in this news release include, among others, statements about: (i) future credit quality and expected or estimated future loan losses in our loan portfolios, and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, including our current expectation of future reductions in the allowance for loan losses; (ii) our targeted noninterest expense for fourth quarter 2012 as part of our expense management initiatives; (iii) our estimates regarding our Tier 1 common equity ratio under proposed Basel III capital regulations; and (iv) the timing of expected integration activities related to the Wachovia merger.
Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements as actual results could differ materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and we do not undertake to update them to reflect changes or events that occur after that date. Several factors could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations including: current and future economic and market conditions, including the effects of further declines in housing prices and high unemployment rates; our capital requirements (including under regulatory capital standards as determined and interpreted by applicable regulatory authorities such as the proposed Basel III capital regulations) and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms; financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses (including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act); the extent of success in our loan modification efforts, including the effects of regulatory requirements, or changes in regulatory requirements, relating to loan modifications; the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands that we receive and our ability to satisfy any such demands without having to repurchase loans related thereto or otherwise indemnify or reimburse third parties; negative effects relating to mortgage foreclosures, including changes in our procedures or practices and/or industry standards or practices, regulatory or judicial requirements, penalties or fines, increased servicing and other costs or obligations, including loan modification requirements, or delays or moratoriums on foreclosures; our ability to realize our noninterest expense target as part of our expense management initiatives when and in the amount targeted, including as a result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, changes in our business composition and operating environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, litigation and regulatory matters; our ability to successfully and timely integrate the Wachovia merger and realize the expected cost savings and other benefits, including delays or disruptions in system conversions and higher severance costs; recognition of other-than-temporary impairment on securities held in our available-for-sale portfolio; the effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale; hedging gains or losses; disruptions in the capital markets and reduced investor demand for mortgage loans; our ability to sell more products to our customers; the effect of the economic recession on the demand for our products and services; the effect of fluctuations in stock market prices on fee income from our brokerage, asset and wealth management businesses; our election to provide support to our mutual funds for structured credit products they may hold; changes in the value of our venture capital investments; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards or in how accounting standards are to be applied; changes in our credit ratings and changes in the credit ratings of our customers or counterparties; mergers and acquisitions; federal and state regulations; reputational damage from negative publicity, fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations; the loss of checking and saving account deposits to other investments such as the stock market; and fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board. There is no assurance that our allowance for credit losses will be adequate to cover future credit losses, especially if credit markets, housing prices, and unemployment do not improve. Increases in loan charge-offs or in the allowance for credit losses and related provision expense could materially adversely affect our financial results and condition. For more information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011, including the discussion under "Risk Factors" in each of these reports, as filed with the SEC and available on the SEC's website at . Any factor described above or in our SEC reports could, by itself or together with one or more other factors, adversely affect our financial results and condition.

Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries
PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (PCI) LOANS
Loans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected are considered to be credit impaired. PCI loans represent loans acquired from Wachovia that were deemed to be credit impaired. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include statistics such as past due and nonaccrual status, recent borrower credit scores and recent LTV percentages. PCI loans are initially measured at fair value, which includes estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan. Accordingly, the associated allowance for credit losses related to these loans is not carried over at the acquisition date.
Under the accounting guidance for PCI loans, the excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans, in situations where there is a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected. Accordingly, such loans are not classified as nonaccrual and they are considered to be accruing because their interest income relates to the accretable yield recognized under accounting for PCI loans and not to contractual interest payments. The difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference.
Subsequent to acquisition, we regularly evaluate our estimates of cash flows expected to be collected. These evaluations, performed quarterly, require the continued usage of key assumptions and estimates, similar to the initial estimate of fair value. If we have probable decreases in the expected cash flows (other than due to a decrease in rate indices), we charge the provision for credit losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. If we have probable and significant increases in the expected cash flows subsequent to establishing an additional allowance, we first reverse any previously established allowance and then increase interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans.
As a result of PCI loan accounting, certain credit-related ratios cannot be used to compare a portfolio that includes PCI loans against one that does not, or to compare ratios across quarters or years. The ratios particularly affected include the allowance for loan losses and allowance for credit losses as percentages of loans, of nonaccrual loans and of nonperforming assets; nonaccrual loans and nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans; and net charge-offs as a percentage of loans.
 
 
Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries
CHANGES IN NONACCRETABLE DIFFERENCE FOR PCI LOANS
The difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. A nonaccretable difference was established in purchase accounting for PCI loans to absorb losses expected at that time on those loans. Amounts absorbed by the nonaccretable difference do not affect the income statement or the allowance for credit losses. Substantially all our commercial and industrial, CRE and foreign PCI loans are accounted for as individual loans. Conversely, Pick-a-Pay and other consumer PCI loans have been aggregated into several pools based on common risk characteristics. Each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. Resolutions of loans may include sales to third parties, receipt of payments in settlement with the borrower, or foreclosure of the collateral. Our policy is to remove an individual loan from a pool based on comparing the amount received from its resolution with its contractual amount. Any difference between these amounts is absorbed by the nonaccretable difference. This removal method assumes that the amount received from resolution approximates pool performance expectations. The accretable yield percentage is unaffected by the resolution and any changes in the effective yield for the remaining loans in the pool are addressed by our quarterly cash flow evaluation process for each pool. For loans that are resolved by payment in full, there is no release of the nonaccretable difference for the pool because there is no difference between the amount received at resolution and the contractual amount of the loan. Modified PCI loans are not removed from a pool even if those loans would otherwise be deemed troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). Modified PCI loans that are accounted for individually are considered TDRs, and removed from PCI accounting, if there has been a concession granted in excess of the original nonaccretable difference. The following table provides an analysis of changes in the nonaccretable difference.

CHANGES IN ACCRETABLE YIELD RELATED TO PCI LOANS
The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying value of PCI loans is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income using an effective yield method over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans. The accretable yield is affected by:
The change in the accretable yield related to PCI loans is presented in the following table.
 
CHANGES IN ALLOWANCE FOR PCI LOAN LOSSES
When it is estimated that the cash flows expected to be collected have decreased subsequent to acquisition for a PCI loan or pool of loans, an allowance is established and a provision for additional loss is recorded as a charge to income. The following table summarizes the changes in allowance for PCI loan losses.
