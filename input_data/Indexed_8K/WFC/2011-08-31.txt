Authorized Denominations

Repayment upon Exercise of Survivor's Option
The Company has agreed to repay beneficial ownership interests in this Security, if requested by the authorized representative of the beneficial owner of such beneficial ownership interest following the death of the beneficial owner, so long as the beneficial ownership interest in this Security was acquired by the beneficial owner at least six months prior to the request (the "").
Survivor's Option
Upon the valid exercise of the Survivor's Option and the proper tender of a beneficial ownership interest in this Security for repayment, the Company will repay such beneficial ownership interest in this Security, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the deceased beneficial owner's beneficial interest in this Security, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repayment.
To be valid, the Survivor's Option must be exercised by or on behalf of the Person who has authority to act on behalf of a deceased beneficial owner of this Security under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction (including, without limitation, the personal representative of or the executor of the estate of the deceased beneficial owner or the surviving joint owner with the deceased beneficial owner).
A beneficial owner of this Security is a Person who has the right, immediately prior to such Person's death, to receive the proceeds from the disposition of such beneficial owner's interest in this Security, as well as the right to receive the principal amount of the deceased beneficial owner's interest in this Security plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon.
 
The death of a Person holding a beneficial ownership interest in this Security as a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety with another Person, or as a tenant in common with the deceased holder's spouse, will be deemed the death of a beneficial owner of that beneficial ownership interest in this Security, and the entire principal amount of the deceased beneficial owner's interest in this Security held in this manner will be subject to repayment by the Company upon exercise of the Survivor's Option. However, the death of a Person holding a beneficial ownership interest in this Security as tenant in common with a Person other than such deceased holder's spouse will be deemed the death of a beneficial owner only with respect to such deceased Person's interest in this Security, and only the deceased beneficial owner's percentage interest in that beneficial ownership interest in the principal amount of this Security will be subject to repayment.
The death of a Person who, during his or her lifetime, was entitled to substantially all of the beneficial ownership interests in this Security will be deemed the death of the beneficial owner of this Security for purposes of the Survivor's Option, regardless of whether that beneficial owner was the registered holder of this Security, if the beneficial ownership interest can be established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent. A beneficial ownership interest will be deemed to exist in typical cases of nominee ownership, ownership under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act or Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, community property, or other joint ownership arrangements between a husband and wife. In addition, the beneficial ownership interest in this Security will be deemed to exist in custodial and trust arrangements where one Person has all of the beneficial ownership interest in this Security during his or her lifetime. In the case of a joint trust, the joint tenant rules above will apply to the respective beneficial ownership interests.
The Company has the discretionary right to limit the aggregate principal amount of this Security as to which exercises of the Survivor's Option will be accepted by the Company from the authorized representative for any individual deceased beneficial owner of this Security in any calendar year to $500,000. In addition, the Company will not permit the exercise of the Survivor's Option for any portion of this Security with a principal amount of less than $1,000, and the Company will not permit the exercise of the Survivor's Option if such exercise will result in this Security having a principal amount that is not an integral multiple of $1,000.
An otherwise valid election to exercise the Survivor's Option may not be withdrawn. An election to exercise the Survivor's Option will be accepted in the order that it was received by the Paying Agent, except for any beneficial ownership interest in this Security the acceptance of which would contravene the limitation described above. Beneficial ownership interests in this Security accepted for repayment through the exercise of the Survivor's Option normally will be repaid on the first Interest Payment Date that occurs 20 or more calendar days after the date of the acceptance. Each tendered beneficial ownership interest in this Security that is not accepted in a calendar year due to the application of the limitation described in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to be tendered in the following calendar year in the order in which all such beneficial interests were originally tendered. If a beneficial ownership interest in this Security tendered through a valid exercise of the Survivor's Option is not accepted, the Paying Agent will deliver a notice by first-class mail to the registered holder, at that registered holder's last known address as indicated in the Security Register, that states the reason that the beneficial ownership interest in this Security has not been accepted for repayment.
 
Since this Security is a Global Security, DTC, as depository, or its nominee will be treated as the holder of this Security and will be the only entity that can exercise the Survivor's Option. To obtain repayment of this Security pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option, the deceased beneficial owner's authorized representative must provide the following items to the broker or other entity through which the beneficial interest in this Security is held by the deceased beneficial owner:
 
(a) the deceased was a beneficial owner of this Security at the time of death and his or her interest in this Security was acquired by the deceased beneficial owner at least six months prior to the request for repayment,
(b) the death of the beneficial owner has occurred and the date of death, and
(c) the representative has authority to act on behalf of the deceased beneficial owner;
 
 
 
 
 
In turn, the broker or other entity will deliver each of these items to the Paying Agent and will certify to the Paying Agent that the broker or other entity represents the deceased beneficial owner.
The Company retains the right to limit the aggregate principal amount of this Security as to which exercises of the Survivor's Option will be accepted by the Company from the authorized representative for any individual deceased beneficial owner in this Security in any calendar year as described above. All other questions regarding the eligibility or validity of any exercise of the Survivor's Option will be determined by the Paying Agent, in its sole discretion, which determination will be final and binding on all parties.
 
The broker or other entity will be responsible for disbursing payments received from the Paying Agent to the authorized representative. Forms for the exercise of the Survivor's Option may be obtained from the Paying Agent.
Registration of Transfer
Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Security at the office or agency of the Company in the City of Minneapolis, Minnesota, a new Security or Securities of this series, with the same terms as this Security, in authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange herefor, as provided in the Indenture and subject to the limitations provided therein and to the limitations described below, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
This Security is exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form only if (x) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Security or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and a successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, (y) the Company in its sole discretion determines that this Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form and notifies the Trustee thereof or (z) an Event of Default with respect to the Securities represented hereby has occurred and is continuing. If this Security is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form, bearing interest at the same rate, having the same date of issuance, Stated Maturity Date and other terms and of authorized denominations aggregating a like amount.
This Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor of the Depositary or a nominee of such successor. Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this Global Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form and will not be considered the Holders hereof for any purpose under the Indenture.
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Obligation of the Company Absolute
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed, except as otherwise provided in this Security.
 
No Personal Recourse
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.
