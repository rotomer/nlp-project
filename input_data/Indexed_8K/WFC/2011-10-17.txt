Selected Financial Information
 
SAN FRANCISCO  Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC) reported record net income of $4.1 billion, or $0.72 per diluted common share, for third quarter 2011, up from $3.3 billion, or $0.60 per share, for third quarter 2010, and up from $3.9 billion, or $0.70 per share, for second quarter 2011.
"The economic recovery has been more sluggish and uneven than anyone anticipated," said Chairman and CEO John Stumpf. "We can't change the economic environment, yet we have worked hard to control the

variables we can  making our products and services more relevant to individuals and businesses, focusing on the customer, making as many loans as possible and growing new relationships  as well as fostering longtime ones. We see the results of this focus in growing cross-sell, deposits, and loans. Customers need a trusted financial partner, especially in challenging economic times. Wells Fargo has proven to be that partner over and over again.
"We are nearing the completion of our three-year Wachovia integration process. To date, Regional Banking has now completed its store conversions and our retail stores are Wells Fargo coast-to-coast on a single platform. Thank you to every single team member who has been involved in this remarkable effort."
"This was a strong quarter for Wells Fargo, with solid growth in loans, deposits, investment securities and capital, along with improved credit quality and lower expenses," said Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan. "While our industry continued to face challenges due to economic conditions during this quarter, Wells Fargo's diversified model was again able to produce solid results for our shareholders."
Revenue
Revenue was $19.6 billion, compared with $20.4 billion in second quarter 2011. "While certain market-sensitive revenues were down from the second quarter, many of our businesses grew revenue," said Sloan. Businesses generating linked-quarter revenue growth included asset management, asset-backed finance, auto dealer services, capital finance, commercial banking, commercial mortgage servicing, commercial real estate, corporate trust, credit card, equipment finance, equity funds group, global remittance, government and institutional banking, international, mortgage, personal credit management, real estate capital markets, retail sales finance, and student lending.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income was $10.5 billion, down from $10.7 billion in second quarter 2011. The continued negative impact of higher-yielding loan and security runoff was partially offset by growth in commercial loans, investment portfolio purchases, lower deposit and debt costs, and the benefit of one additional business day in the quarter. Net interest income was also lower due to items that vary from quarter to quarter such as loan prepayments and resolutions. Approximately 12 basis points of the 17 basis point decline in the net interest margin  slightly over 70 percent  from 4.01 percent in second quarter to 3.84 percent in third quarter was due to the exceptional deposit growth of $42 billion from June 30, 2011. These deposits were invested in short-term assets which had the effect of diluting the net interest margin.
 
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income was $9.1 billion, compared with $9.7 billion in second quarter 2011. The $622 million decline was driven by an $808 million decline in trading, debt and equity gains primarily related to reduced equity gains compared with the prior quarter's elevated levels, losses on deferred compensation plan investments and market volatility. Commissions and all other fees declined 8 percent linked quarter due to lower bond and equity originations, lower commissions, and lower asset-based fees associated with the 14 percent decline in the S&P 500 Index in the quarter. Insurance fees were down 26 percent linked quarter almost entirely due to seasonality in crop insurance. Deposit service charges increased 3 percent linked quarter primarily due to account and volume growth. Operating lease income was up on early termination gains.
Mortgage banking noninterest income was $1.8 billion, up $214 million from second quarter 2011, on $89 billion of originations compared with $64 billion of originations in second quarter. Mortgage banking noninterest income in third quarter included a $390 million provision for mortgage loan repurchase losses compared with $242 million in second quarter (included in net gains from mortgage loan origination/sales activities). Net mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) results were a $607 million gain compared with a $374 million gain in second quarter 2011. The ratio of MSRs to related loans serviced for others was 74 basis points and the average note rate on the servicing portfolio was 5.21 percent. The unclosed pipeline at September 30, 2011, was $84 billion compared with $51 billion at June 30, 2011.
The Company had net unrealized securities gains of $6.8 billion at September 30, 2011, down $2.4 billion from second quarter 2011, primarily due to widening credit spreads. Period-end securities available for sale balances were up $20.9 billion, reflecting increased investment activity.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense was $11.7 billion, down $798 million from second quarter 2011 and down $576 million from a year ago. The linked-quarter decline in noninterest expense was driven by lower total personnel expense ($6.6 billion, down from $6.9 billion in second quarter 2011), lower merger costs ($376 million, down from $484 million prior quarter) and lower operating losses ($198 million, down from $428 million prior quarter). Included in personnel expense was a $384 million linked-quarter decline in employee benefits due primarily to lower deferred compensation expense which was offset entirely in trading gains and losses. "We are pleased with our positive operating leverage and the progress we've made on our Compass expense management initiative. Future quarterly expenses are expected to fluctuate as our Compass initiative proceeds toward our stated target of $11 billion of noninterest expense for fourth quarter 2012," said Sloan. The Company's efficiency ratio improved to 59.5 percent from 61.2 percent in second quarter.
 
 
Loans
Total loans were $760.1 billion at September 30, 2011, up $8.2 billion from $751.9 billion at June 30, 2011. Increased balances in many loan portfolios more than offset the continued planned reduction in the non-strategic/liquidating portfolios, which declined $5.2 billion in the quarter. Many portfolios had linked-quarter growth in average loan balances, including asset-backed finance, auto (excluding liquidating), capital finance, commercial banking, commercial real estate, corporate banking, credit card, government and institutional banking, international, mortgage, private student lending and retail sales finance.
 
 
Deposits
Average core deposits were $836.8 billion, up 8 percent from a year ago and up 14 percent (annualized) from second quarter 2011. Consumer checking accounts grew a net 5.6 percent from September 30, 2010. Average core checking and savings deposits were $769.2 billion, up 12 percent from a year ago and up 18 percent (annualized) from second quarter 2011. Average mortgage escrow deposits were $28.3 billion compared with $30.2 billion a year ago and $23.9 billion in second quarter 2011. Average core checking and savings deposits were 92 percent of average core deposits, up from 89 percent a year ago. The average deposit cost for third quarter 2011 was 25 basis points compared with 28 basis points in second quarter 2011. Average core deposits were 111 percent of average loans, up from 107 percent in second quarter 2011.
Capital
Capital increased with Tier 1 common equity reaching $91.9 billion under Basel I, or 9.35 percent of risk-weighted assets. Under current Basel III proposals, the Tier 1 common equity ratio was an estimated 7.41 percent. The Company called for redemption $5.8 billion of trust preferred securities in the quarter, repurchased 22 million shares of its common stock and an additional estimated 6 million shares through a forward repurchase transaction that will settle in fourth quarter 2011, and paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.12 per share.
 
 
 
Credit Quality
"Credit quality continued to improve in the third quarter, our seventh consecutive quarter of declining loan losses and the fourth consecutive quarter of lower nonperforming assets," said Chief Risk Officer Mike Loughlin. Third quarter net charge-offs were $2.6 billion, or 1.37 percent (annualized) of average loans, down $227 million from second quarter net charge-offs of $2.8 billion (1.52 percent). The decline in net charge-offs was driven by lower losses in nearly all loan categories and delinquency trends were stable. Reflecting the improved overall portfolio performance, the provision for credit losses was $800 million less than net charge-offs, compared with $1.0 billion in prior quarter. "While we continued to see positive trends in credit performance, the rate of improvement moderated in some portfolios in the quarter, as one would expect at this point in the credit cycle," said Loughlin. "Absent significant deterioration in the economy, we continue to expect future reserve releases."

Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets ended the quarter at $26.8 billion, down 4 percent from $27.9 billion in the second quarter. Nonaccrual loans declined to $21.9 billion from $23.0 billion in the second quarter, with reductions across all major loan portfolios, resulting from reduced inflow of new nonaccrual loans and stable outflows to foreclosed assets. Foreclosed assets increased slightly to $4.9 billion.
Nonperforming Assets (Nonaccrual Loans and Foreclosed Assets)
 
Loans 90 Days or More Past Due and Still Accruing
Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing (excluding government insured/ guaranteed) totaled $1.9 billion at September 30, 2011, compared with $1.8 billion at June 30, 2011. Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing whose repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration or predominantly guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs for mortgages and the U.S. Department of Education for student loans under the Federal Family Education Loan Program were $17.7 billion at September 30, 2011, compared with $15.5 billion at June 30, 2011.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for unfunded commitments, totaled $20.4 billion at September 30, 2011, down from $21.3 billion at June 30, 2011. The allowance coverage to total loans was 2.68 percent compared with 2.83 percent in the prior quarter. The allowance covered 1.97 times annualized third quarter net charge-offs compared with 1.87 times in the prior quarter. The allowance coverage to nonaccrual loans was 93 percent at September 30, 2011, compared with 92 percent at June 30, 2011. "We
 
 
believe the allowance was adequate for losses inherent in the loan portfolio at September 30, 2011," said Loughlin.

Community Banking
offers a complete line of diversified financial products and services for consumers and small businesses including investment, insurance and trust services in 39 states and D.C., and mortgage and home equity loans in all 50 states and D.C. through its Regional Banking and Wells Fargo Home Mortgage business units.
Selected Financial Information
 
Community Banking reported net income of $2.3 billion, up $228 million, or 11 percent, from prior quarter and up $380 million, or 20 percent, from third quarter 2010. Revenue decreased $71 million from second quarter 2011 driven primarily by a decline in equity gains primarily related to market conditions in the quarter, losses on deferred compensation plan investments (offset in employee benefits expense and therefore neutral to the income statement), continued expected reductions in the home equity and Pick-A-Pay loan portfolios, and lower yielding investment security purchases, partially offset by an increase in mortgage banking income and lower deposit costs. Revenue decreased $951 million, or 7 percent, from third quarter 2010 largely due to lower mortgage banking income, as well as expected reductions in the liquidating loan portfolios and lower yielding investment security purchases, partially offset by long-term debt runoff, lower deposit costs, equity gains and debit card customer growth. Noninterest expense decreased
 
 
$517 million, or 7 percent, from second quarter 2011, reflecting lower personnel costs (including active, full-time equivalent reductions and lower deferred compensation benefits expense), litigation accruals, and credit related costs. Noninterest expense decreased $432 million, or 6 percent, from third quarter 2010 due to reduced expenses across most categories, led by personnel costs. The provision for credit losses increased $51 million from second quarter 2011 and decreased $1.2 billion from third quarter 2010. Charge-offs decreased $199 million from second quarter 2011 and $1.1 billion from third quarter 2010. The reserve release was $450 million in third quarter 2011, compared with releases of $700 million and $400 million in second quarter 2011 and third quarter 2010, respectively.

Selected Financial Information
 
Wholesale Banking reported net income of $1.8 billion, up $301 million, or 20 percent, from third quarter 2010 and decreased $118 million, or 6 percent, from the prior quarter. Revenue decreased $238 million, or 4 percent, from prior year as broad-based growth among many businesses, including strong loan and deposit growth, was offset by lower PCI resolutions and weakness in fixed income sales and trading and investment banking. Many businesses had revenue growth from the prior quarter, including asset-backed finance, capital finance, commercial banking, government banking, and international. However, overall revenue decreased $481 million, or 9 percent, from the prior quarter due to lower PCI resolutions, weakness in fixed income sales and trading and investment banking and seasonally lower insurance fees. Noninterest expense decreased $30 million, or 1 percent, from prior year related to lower personnel expenses and decreased $77 million, or 3 percent, from prior quarter related to seasonally lower insurance expense and lower
 
operating losses. The provision for credit losses was a net recovery of $178 million and declined $458 million from third quarter 2010. The decrease included a $350 million reserve release in the current quarter versus a $250 million reserve release a year ago along with a $358 million improvement in credit losses.

Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Information
In accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we caution you that this news release contains forward-looking statements about our future financial performance and business. We make forward-looking statements when we use words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "target," "should," "may," "can," "will," "outlook," "project," "appears" or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements in this news release include, among others, statements about: (i) future credit quality and expected or estimated future loan losses in our loan portfolios, and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, including our current expectation of future reductions in the allowance for loan losses; (ii) our targeted noninterest expense for fourth quarter 2012 as part of our expense management initiatives; (iii) our estimates regarding our Tier 1 common equity ratio under proposed Basel III capital regulations; and (iv) the timing of expected integration activities related to the Wachovia merger.
Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements as actual results could differ materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and we do not undertake to update them to reflect changes or events that occur after that date. Several factors could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations including: current and future economic and market conditions, including the effects of further declines in housing prices, high unemployment rates, U.S. fiscal debt and budget matters and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe; our capital requirements (including under regulatory capital standards as determined and interpreted by applicable regulatory authorities such as the proposed Basel III capital regulations) and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms; financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses (including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act); the extent of success in our loan modification efforts, including the effects of regulatory requirements, or changes in regulatory requirements, relating to loan modifications; the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands that we receive and our ability to satisfy any such demands without having to repurchase loans related thereto or otherwise indemnify or reimburse third parties; negative effects relating to mortgage foreclosures, including changes in our procedures or practices and/or industry standards or practices, regulatory or judicial requirements, penalties or fines, increased servicing and other costs or obligations, including loan modification requirements, or delays or moratoriums on foreclosures; our ability to realize our noninterest expense target as part of our expense management initiatives when and in the amount targeted, including as a result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, changes in our business composition and operating environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, litigation and regulatory matters; our ability to successfully and timely integrate the Wachovia merger and realize the expected cost savings and other benefits, including delays or disruptions in system conversions; recognition of other-than-temporary impairment on securities held in our available-for-sale portfolio; the effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale; hedging gains or losses; disruptions in the capital markets and reduced investor demand for mortgage loans; our ability to sell more products to our customers; the effect of the economic recession on the demand for our products and services; the effect of fluctuations in stock market prices on fee income from our brokerage, asset and wealth management businesses; our election to provide support to our mutual funds for structured credit products they may hold; changes in the value of our venture capital investments; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards or in how accounting standards are to be applied; changes in our credit ratings and changes in the credit ratings of our customers or counterparties; mergers and acquisitions; federal and state regulations; reputational damage from negative publicity, fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations; the loss of checking and saving account deposits to other investments such as the stock market; and fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board. There is no assurance that our allowance for credit losses will be adequate to cover future credit losses, especially if housing prices and unemployment do not improve. Increases in loan charge-offs or in the allowance for credit losses and related provision expense could materially adversely affect our financial results and condition. For more information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the discussion under "Risk Factors" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30,2011, as filed with the SEC and available on the SEC's website at . Any factor described above or in our SEC reports could, by itself or together with one or more other factors, adversely affect our financial results and condition.

Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries
PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (PCI) LOANS
Loans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected are considered to be credit impaired. PCI loans represent loans acquired from Wachovia that were deemed to be credit impaired. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include statistics such as past due and nonaccrual status, recent borrower credit scores and recent LTV percentages. PCI loans are initially measured at fair value, which includes estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan. Accordingly, the associated allowance for credit losses related to these loans is not carried over at the acquisition date.
Under the accounting guidance for PCI loans, the excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans, in situations where there is a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected. Accordingly, such loans are not classified as nonaccrual and they are considered to be accruing because their interest income relates to the accretable yield recognized under accounting for PCI loans and not to contractual interest payments. The difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference.
Subsequent to acquisition, we regularly evaluate our estimates of cash flows expected to be collected. These evaluations, performed quarterly, require the continued usage of key assumptions and estimates, similar to the initial estimate of fair value. If we have probable decreases in the expected cash flows (other than due to a decrease in rate indices), we charge the provision for credit losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. If we have probable and significant increases in the expected cash flows subsequent to establishing an additional allowance, we first reverse any previously established allowance and then increase interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans.
As a result of PCI loan accounting, certain credit-related ratios cannot be used to compare a portfolio that includes PCI loans against one that does not, or to compare ratios across quarters or years. The ratios particularly affected include the allowance for loan losses and allowance for credit losses as percentages of loans, of nonaccrual loans and of nonperforming assets; nonaccrual loans and nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans; and net charge-offs as a percentage of loans.

CHANGES IN NONACCRETABLE DIFFERENCE FOR PCI LOANS
The difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. A nonaccretable difference was established in purchase accounting for PCI loans to absorb losses expected at that time on those loans. Amounts absorbed by the nonaccretable difference do not affect the income statement or the allowance for credit losses. Substantially all our commercial and industrial, CRE and foreign PCI loans are accounted for as individual loans. Conversely, Pick-a-Pay and other consumer PCI loans have been aggregated into several pools based on common risk characteristics. Each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. Resolutions of loans may include sales to third parties, receipt of payments in settlement with the borrower, or foreclosure of the collateral. Our policy is to remove an individual loan from a pool based on comparing the amount received from its resolution with its contractual amount. Any difference between these amounts is absorbed by the nonaccretable difference. This removal method assumes that the amount received from resolution approximates pool performance expectations. The accretable yield percentage is unaffected by the resolution and any changes in the effective yield for the remaining loans in the pool are addressed by our quarterly cash flow evaluation process for each pool. For loans that are resolved by payment in full, there is no release of the nonaccretable difference for the pool because there is no difference between the amount received at resolution and the contractual amount of the loan. Modified PCI loans are not removed from a pool even if those loans would otherwise be deemed troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). Modified PCI loans that are accounted for individually are considered TDRs, and removed from PCI accounting, if there has been a concession granted in excess of the original nonaccretable difference. The following table provides an analysis of changes in the nonaccretable difference.

CHANGES IN ACCRETABLE YIELD RELATED TO PCI LOANS
The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying value of PCI loans is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income using an effective yield method over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans. The accretable yield is affected by:
 
 
 
The change in the accretable yield related to PCI loans is presented in the following table.
 
 
CHANGES IN ALLOWANCE FOR PCI LOAN LOSSES
When it is estimated that the cash flows expected to be collected have decreased subsequent to acquisition for a PCI loan or pool of loans, an allowance is established and a provision for additional loss is recorded as a charge to income. The following table summarizes the changes in allowance for PCI loan losses.
