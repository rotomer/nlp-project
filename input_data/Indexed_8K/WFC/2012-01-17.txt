SAN FRANCISCO  Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC) reported record net income of $4.1 billion, or $0.73 per diluted common share, for fourth quarter 2011, compared with $3.4 billion, or $0.61 per share, for fourth quarter 2010, and $4.1 billion, or $0.72 per share, for third quarter 2011. Full year 2011 Wells Fargo net income was $15.9 billion, or $2.82 per share, up 28 percent from 2010.
"I'm extremely pleased with Wells Fargo's performance in 2011  including strong deposit and loan growth, record cross-sell and record earnings," said Chairman and CEO John Stumpf. "We achieved these results while completing the conversion of Wachovia's retail banking stores  the largest such conversion in banking history  and now all of our 6,239 retail banking stores are on a single platform serving customers coast to coast. At the time of the merger, we said the integration of Wachovia would take three years and we are right on track. I couldn't be prouder of how our two companies have come together as one, thanks to the important and tireless work of our more than 260,000 team members.
"In 2012, we are focused on Wells Fargo's many opportunities, including continuing to provide our customers with award winning service, welcoming new customers as we grow market share throughout our many businesses and geographies, achieving efficiency improvements across the company and returning even more capital to our shareholders."
"The fourth quarter of 2011 was a very strong quarter for Wells Fargo, with record earnings, solid linked quarter growth in loans, deposits and capital, and continued strong credit quality," said Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan. "Revenue was up 5 percent from the third quarter despite a full quarter's impact of the new debit interchange rules. As expected, expenses were higher in the quarter and we are maintaining our target of $11 billion in noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2012."
Revenue
Revenue was $20.6 billion, up from $19.6 billion in third quarter 2011. "We are pleased with revenue performance in the quarter. Both net interest income, which benefited from the growth in earning assets and an increase in the net interest margin, and noninterest income, which was bolstered by strong mortgage banking and capital markets results, were up this quarter," said Sloan. Businesses generating linked-quarter revenue growth included asset-backed finance, capital markets, commercial banking, commercial real estate, corporate banking, corporate trust, credit card, equipment finance, government and institutional banking, insurance, international, merchant services, mortgage, real estate capital markets and retail sales finance.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income was $10.9 billion, up from $10.5 billion in third quarter 2011. Average earning assets increased $24.3 billion from third quarter 2011, driven by growth in loans, securities and mortgages held for sale. Continued success in generating low-cost deposits enabled the Company to fund the asset growth while at the same time reducing long-term debt, including the redemption of $5.8 billion of higher-cost trust preferred securities. The net interest margin increased to 3.89 percent from 3.84 percent in third quarter
 
2011. Lower deposit costs, less long-term debt, and the redeployment of short-term investments into higher-yielding assets such as securities and loans contributed to the increase in the margin.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income was $9.7 billion, compared with $9.1 billion in third quarter 2011. The $627 million increase was driven by increases of $531 million in mortgage banking and $337 million in trading, debt and equity gains. Card fees declined $333 million from third quarter due to a $365 million decline in debit interchange fees partially offset by improved credit card fee revenue. Other income included a $153 million gain on sale from H.D. Vest.
Mortgage banking noninterest income was $2.4 billion, up $531 million from third quarter 2011, on $120 billion of originations compared with $89 billion of originations in third quarter. Mortgage banking noninterest income in fourth quarter included a $404 million provision for mortgage loan repurchase losses compared with $390 million in third quarter (included in net gains from mortgage loan origination/sales activities). Net mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) results were a $201 million gain compared with a $607 million gain in third quarter 2011. The ratio of MSRs to related loans serviced for others was 76 basis points and the average note rate on the servicing portfolio was 5.14 percent. The unclosed pipeline at December 31, 2011, was $72 billion compared with $84 billion at September 30, 2011.
The Company had net unrealized securities gains of $7.0 billion at December 31, 2011, compared with a net unrealized gain of $6.8 billion at September 30, 2010. Period-end securities available for sale balances were up $15.4 billion, reflecting continued investment activity.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense increased in the quarter, to $12.5 billion, compared with $11.7 billion in third quarter. Third quarter expense included a $210 million benefit due to lower deferred compensation expenses associated with an offsetting trading loss. In addition to this factor, the increase in fourth quarter expenses was primarily driven by the following:
 
 
 
The Company expects first quarter 2012 noninterest expense to remain elevated due to seasonally high personnel expenses offset by lower integration expenses and continued gains from efficiency and cost save initiatives. Starting in second quarter 2012, total expenses are expected to decline over the remainder of the
 
year, driven by the benefit from ongoing efficiency initiatives and the conclusion of integration activities. The Company continues to target fourth quarter 2012 noninterest expense of $11 billion.
Loans
Total loans were $769.6 billion at December 31, 2011, up $9.5 billion from $760.1 billion at September 30, 2011. Increased balances in many loan portfolios more than offset the continued planned reduction in the non-strategic/liquidating portfolios, which declined $4.2 billion in the quarter. Period-end core loans grew $13.7 billion and included $2.1 billion of U.S.-based commercial real estate (CRE) loans purchased in the quarter, as well as an additional $5.6 billion of consumer real estate 1-4 family loans related to the consolidation of previously sold reverse mortgage loans. Organic loan growth of $6.0 billion linked quarter was driven by commercial and industrial growth from expanding relationships with existing customers and new customer loans. Additional growth came from a 4 percent increase in foreign loans and a 5 percent increase in credit card balances, reflecting higher purchase dollar volumes and transactions, as well as new account growth.
Many loan portfolios had linked-quarter growth in average balances, including asset-backed finance, capital finance, commercial banking, commercial real estate, corporate banking, credit card, government and institutional banking, international, mortgage, real estate capital markets, and retail sales finance.
 
 
Deposits
Average core deposits were $864.9 billion, up 9 percent from a year ago and up 13 percent (annualized) from third quarter 2011. Consumer checking accounts grew a net 3.2 percent from December 31, 2010. Average core checking and savings deposits were $800 billion, up 12 percent from a year ago and up 16 percent (annualized) from third quarter 2011. Average mortgage escrow deposits were $34.9 billion compared with $36.0 billion a year ago and $28.3 billion in third quarter 2011. Average core checking and savings deposits were 93 percent of average core deposits, up from 90 percent a year ago. Deposit costs for fourth quarter 2011 were 22 basis points compared with 25 basis points in third quarter 2011. Average core deposits were 113 percent of average loans, up from 111 percent in third quarter 2011.
 
Capital
Capital increased in the fourth quarter, with Tier 1 common equity reaching $95.1 billion under Basel I, or 9.46 percent of risk-weighted assets. Under current Basel III proposals, the Tier 1 common equity ratio was an estimated 7.49 percent. The Company redeemed $5.8 billion of trust preferred securities in the quarter, repurchased 27 million shares of its common stock, plus an additional estimated 6 million shares through a forward repurchase transaction that will settle in first quarter 2012, and paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.12 per share.
 
 
Credit Quality
"Credit remained strong and within expectations in the fourth quarter. Consumer losses were essentially flat from third quarter while commercial losses increased slightly as we experienced normal period-to-period fluctuation. Based on our current forecasts, we expect continued improvement in credit in 2012," said Chief Risk Officer Mike Loughlin.
Fourth quarter net charge-offs were $2.6 billion, or 1.36 percent (annualized) of average loans, essentially flat from third quarter net charge-offs of $2.6 billion (1.37 percent). The provision for credit losses was $600 million less than net charge-offs, compared with $800 million less than net charge-offs in the prior quarter, reflecting our expected continued improvement. "We have seen significant improvement in credit performance over the past eight quarters, and expect continued but slower improvement in 2012 as portfolio quality approaches a stable, more normal level," said Loughlin. "Absent significant deterioration in the economy, we continue to expect future reserve releases in 2012."
 
Net Loan Charge-Offs
 
 
Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets ended the quarter at $26.0 billion, down 3 percent from $26.8 billion in the third quarter. Nonaccrual loans declined to $21.3 billion from $21.9 billion in the third quarter, with reductions across the majority of our larger loan portfolios, resulting from stable inflows. Foreclosed assets decreased to $4.7 billion from $4.9 billion in third quarter.
Nonperforming Assets (Nonaccrual Loans and Foreclosed Assets)
 
 
Loans 90 Days or More Past Due and Still Accruing
Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing (excluding government insured/guaranteed) totaled $2.0 billion at December 31, 2011, compared with $1.9 billion at September 30, 2011. Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing whose repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or predominantly guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for mortgages and the U.S. Department of Education for student loans under the Federal Family Education Loan Program were $20.5 billion at December 31, 2011, up from $17.7 billion at September 30, 2011, due primarily to growth in the FHA/VA portfolio over the past two years and the subsequent seasoning of those loans.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for unfunded commitments, totaled $19.7 billion at December 31, 2011, down from $20.4 billion at September 30, 2011. The allowance coverage to total loans was 2.56 percent compared with 2.68 percent in the prior quarter. The allowance covered 1.88 times annualized fourth quarter net charge-offs compared with 1.97 times in the prior quarter. The allowance coverage to nonaccrual loans was 92 percent at December 31, 2011, compared with 93 percent at September 30, 2011. "We believe the allowance was appropriate for losses inherent in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2011," said Loughlin.

Selected Financial Information
 
Community Banking reported net income of $2.5 billion, up $188 million, or 8 percent, from third quarter 2011 and up $579 million, or 30 percent, from fourth quarter 2010. Revenue increased $508 million, or 4 percent, from third quarter 2011 driven by higher volume-related mortgage banking income, noninterest bearing deposit growth and gains on deferred compensation plan investments (offset in employee benefits expense and therefore neutral to the income statement), mitigated by the impact of lower debit card revenues and smaller bond and equity sale gains. Noninterest expense increased $409 million, or 6 percent, from third quarter 2011, reflecting higher personnel costs (revenue-related incentive compensation in Home Mortgage and increased deferred compensation benefits expense), seasonal increase in foreclosed assets expense, an increase in Home Mortgage related to the mortgage servicing regulatory consent orders, and seasonally higher equipment purchases. Noninterest expense decreased $545 million, or 7 percent, from fourth quarter 2010, as last year's fourth quarter included a two-year charitable donation commitment of $400 million. Contributing to lower expenses this year were reduced foreclosed asset expense and efficiency and cost save initiatives. The provision for credit losses increased $53 million from third quarter 2011 and decreased $754 million from fourth quarter 2010. Charge-offs increased $41 million from third quarter 2011 and decreased $966 million from fourth quarter 2010. The reserve release was $438 million in fourth quarter 2011, compared with releases of $450 million and $650 million in third quarter 2011 and fourth quarter 2010, respectively.

Selected Financial Information
Wholesale Banking reported net income of $1.6 billion, down $172 million or 9 percent from the third quarter and $49 million or 3 percent from fourth quarter 2010. Revenue increased $275 million or 5 percent from the third quarter primarily due to strong loan and deposit growth across most businesses, including commercial banking, commercial real estate, corporate banking, government banking and international. Revenue also benefited from capital markets and investment banking results which rebounded from prior quarter depressed levels. Revenue decreased $415 million, or 7 percent from fourth quarter 2010 as broad based growth among many businesses, including strong loan and deposit growth, was offset by lower PCI resolutions and other gains. Noninterest expense increased $250 million, or 9 percent, from the third quarter due to higher variable compensation related to higher revenue and increased operating losses and foreclosed asset expenses. Expenses decreased $53 million, or 2 percent, from fourth quarter 2010 related to lower operating losses. The provision for credit losses was $32 million and increased $210 million from the third quarter primarily due to lower reserve release. Provision declined $163 million from fourth quarter 2010. The decrease included a $150 million reserve release in fourth quarter 2011 compared with a $200 million reserve release in the fourth quarter a year ago along with a $213 million improvement in net charge-offs.

Selected Financial Information
 
Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement reported net income of $325 million, up $34 million from third quarter 2011 and up $128 million from fourth quarter 2010. Revenue was $3.1 billion, up 6 percent from third quarter 2011 driven by $59 million in gains on deferred compensation plan investments (offset in expense compared with $128 million in losses in third quarter 2011) and a $153 million gain on the sale of the H.D. Vest business. Excluding deferred compensation and H.D. Vest gains, revenue was down 5 percent due to lower asset-based fees, reduced brokerage transaction revenue and lower securities gains in the brokerage business. Total provision for credit losses decreased $28 million for the quarter, including a reserve release of $12 million in fourth quarter 2011. Noninterest expense increased 6 percent from third quarter 2011 primarily due to higher deferred compensation expense, $52 million in fourth quarter 2011 compared to a $125 million benefit in third quarter 2011. Excluding the $177 million increase in deferred compensation expense, noninterest expense decreased 1 percent primarily due to reduced broker commissions on lower production levels. Revenue was up 1 percent from fourth quarter 2010; excluding the impact of the H.D. Vest gain, revenue was down 4 percent due to lower brokerage transaction revenue. Total provision for credit losses decreased $93 million from fourth quarter 2010. Noninterest expense was down 3 percent from fourth quarter 2010 driven by a decline in personnel costs largely due to decreased broker commissions, driven by lower production levels, and decreased non-personnel costs. Average core deposits increased $3.2 billion from third quarter 2011 and $15.1 billion from fourth quarter 2010.

Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Information
In accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we caution you that this news release contains forward-looking statements about our future financial performance and business. We make forward-looking statements when we use words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "target," "should," "may," "can," "will," "outlook," "project," "appears" or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements in this news release include, among others, statements about: (i) future credit quality and performance, and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, including our current expectation of future reductions in the allowance for loan losses; (ii) our expectations regarding elevated first quarter 2012 noninterest expense and declines in noninterest expense beginning in second quarter 2012, as well as our targeted noninterest expense for fourth quarter 2012 as part of our expense management initiatives; (iii) our estimates regarding our Tier 1 common equity ratio under proposed Basel III capital regulations and our expectations regarding returning more capital to our shareholders; and (iv) the timing of remaining integration activities related to the Wachovia merger.
Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements as actual results could differ materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and we do not undertake to update them to reflect changes or events that occur after that date. Several factors could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations including: current and future economic and market conditions, including the effects of further declines in housing prices, high unemployment rates, U.S. fiscal debt and budget matters and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe; our capital requirements (including under regulatory capital standards as determined and interpreted by applicable regulatory authorities such as the proposed Basel III capital regulations) and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms; financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses (including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act); the extent of success in our loan modification efforts, including the effects of regulatory requirements, or changes in regulatory requirements, relating to loan modifications; the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands that we receive and our ability to satisfy any such demands without having to repurchase loans related thereto or otherwise indemnify or reimburse third parties; negative effects relating to mortgage foreclosures, including changes in our procedures or practices and/or industry standards or practices, regulatory or judicial requirements, penalties or fines, increased servicing and other costs or obligations, including loan modification requirements, or delays or moratoriums on foreclosures; our ability to realize our noninterest expense target as part of our expense management initiatives when and in the amount targeted, including as a result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, changes in our business composition and operating environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, litigation and regulatory matters; our ability to successfully complete the remaining Wachovia integration activities, as well as realize the expected benefits of the Wachovia merger; a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers; recognition of other-than-temporary impairment on securities held in our available-for-sale portfolio; the effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale; hedging gains or losses; disruptions in the capital markets and reduced investor demand for mortgage loans; our ability to sell more products to our customers; the effect of the economic recession on the demand for our products and services; the effect of fluctuations in stock market prices on fee income from our brokerage, asset and wealth management businesses; our election to provide support to our mutual funds for structured credit products they may hold; changes in the value of our venture capital investments; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards or in how accounting standards are to be applied; changes in our credit ratings and changes in the credit ratings of our customers or counterparties; mergers and acquisitions; federal and state regulations; reputational damage from negative publicity, fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations; the loss of checking and saving account deposits to other investments such as the stock market; and fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board. There is no assurance that our allowance for credit losses will be adequate to cover future credit losses, especially if housing prices and unemployment do not improve. Increases in loan charge-offs or in the allowance for credit losses and related provision expense could materially adversely affect our financial results and condition. For more information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the discussion under "Risk Factors" in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2011, and September 30, 2011, as filed with the SEC and available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Any factor described above or in our SEC reports could, by itself or together with one or more other factors, adversely affect our financial results and condition.

Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries
PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (PCI) LOANS
Loans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected are considered to be credit impaired. PCI loans predominately represent loans acquired from Wachovia that were deemed to be credit impaired. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include statistics such as past due and nonaccrual status, recent borrower credit scores and recent LTV percentages. PCI loans are initially measured at fair value, which includes estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan. Accordingly, the associated allowance for credit losses related to these loans is not carried over at the acquisition date.
Under the accounting guidance for PCI loans, the excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans, in situations where there is a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected. Accordingly, such loans are not classified as nonaccrual and they are considered to be accruing because their interest income relates to the accretable yield recognized under accounting for PCI loans and not to contractual interest payments. The difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference.
Subsequent to acquisition, we regularly evaluate our estimates of cash flows expected to be collected. These evaluations, performed quarterly, require the continued usage of key assumptions and estimates, similar to the initial estimate of fair value. If we have probable decreases in the expected cash flows (other than due to a decrease in rate indices), we charge the provision for credit losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. If we have probable and significant increases in the expected cash flows subsequent to establishing an additional allowance, we first reverse any previously established allowance and then increase interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans.
As a result of PCI loan accounting, certain credit-related ratios cannot be used to compare a portfolio that includes PCI loans against one that does not, or to compare ratios across quarters or years. The ratios particularly affected include the allowance for loan losses and allowance for credit losses as percentages of loans, of nonaccrual loans and of nonperforming assets; nonaccrual loans and nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans; and net charge-offs as a percentage of loans.
 
 
Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries
CHANGES IN NONACCRETABLE DIFFERENCE FOR PCI LOANS
The difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. A nonaccretable difference is established in purchase accounting for PCI loans to absorb losses expected at that time on those loans. Amounts absorbed by the nonaccretable difference do not affect the income statement or the allowance for credit losses. Substantially all our commercial and industrial, CRE and foreign PCI loans are accounted for as individual loans. Conversely, Pick-a-Pay and other consumer PCI loans have been aggregated into several pools based on common risk characteristics. Each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. Resolutions of loans may include sales to third parties, receipt of payments in settlement with the borrower, or foreclosure of the collateral. Our policy is to remove an individual loan from a pool based on comparing the amount received from its resolution with its contractual amount. Any difference between these amounts is absorbed by the nonaccretable difference. This removal method assumes that the amount received from resolution approximates pool performance expectations. The accretable yield percentage is unaffected by the resolution and any changes in the effective yield for the remaining loans in the pool are addressed by our quarterly cash flow evaluation process for each pool. For loans that are resolved by payment in full, there is no release of the nonaccretable difference for the pool because there is no difference between the amount received at resolution and the contractual amount of the loan. Modified PCI loans are not removed from a pool even if those loans would otherwise be deemed troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). Modified PCI loans that are accounted for individually are considered TDRs, and removed from PCI accounting, if there has been a concession granted in excess of the original nonaccretable difference. The following table provides an analysis of changes in the nonaccretable difference.
