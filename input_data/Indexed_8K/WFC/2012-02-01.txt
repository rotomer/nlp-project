Calculation Agent
Discontinuance Of The Index; Alteration Of Method Of Calculation
If the Index Sponsor discontinues publication of the Index, and the Index Sponsor or another entity publishes a successor or substitute equity index that the Calculation Agent determines, in its sole discretion, to be comparable to the Index (a ""), then, upon the Calculation Agent's notification of that determination to the Trustee and the Company, the Calculation Agent will substitute the Successor Equity Index as calculated by the relevant Index Sponsor or any other entity and calculate the Ending Level as described above. Upon any selection by the Calculation Agent of a Successor Equity Index, the Company will cause notice to be given to the Holder of this Security.
Successor Equity Index
In the event that the Index Sponsor discontinues publication of the Index and the Calculation Agent does not select a Successor Equity Index, the Calculation Agent will compute a substitute level for the Index in accordance with the procedures last used to calculate the Index before any discontinuance. If a Successor Equity Index is selected or the Calculation Agent calculates a level as a substitute for the Index, the Successor Equity Index or level will be used as a substitute for the Index for all purposes, including the purpose of determining whether a Market Disruption Event exists.
 
If at any time the Index Sponsor makes a material change in the formula for or the method of calculating the Index, or in any other way materially modifies the Index so that the Index does not, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent, fairly represent the level of the Index had those changes or modifications not been made, then, from and after that time, the Calculation Agent will, at the close of business in New York, New York, on the date that the Closing Level of the Index is to be calculated, make any adjustments as, in the good faith judgment of the Calculation Agent, may be necessary in order to arrive at a value of an equity index comparable to the Index as if those changes or modifications had not been made, and calculate the level of the Index with reference to such equity index, as so adjusted. Accordingly, if the method of calculating the Index is modified so that the level of the Index is a fraction or a multiple of what it would have been if it had not been modified, then the Calculation Agent will adjust the Index in order to arrive at a level of the Index as if it had not been modified.
Market Disruption Events
A "" means, with respect to the Index, any of the following events as determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion:
Market Disruption Event
 
 
 
 
 
For purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred:
 
 
 
Calculation Agent
The Calculation Agent will determine the Redemption Amount and the Ending Level. In addition, the Calculation Agent will (i) determine if adjustments are required to the Closing Level of the Index under the circumstances described in this Security, (ii) if publication of the Index is discontinued, select a Successor Equity Index or, if no Successor Equity Index is available, determine the Closing Level of the Index under the circumstances described in this Security, and (iii) determine whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred.
The Company covenants that, so long as this Security is Outstanding, there shall at all times be a Calculation Agent (which shall be a broker-dealer, bank or other financial institution) with respect to this Security.
 
All determinations made by the Calculation Agent with respect to this Security will be at the sole discretion of the Calculation Agent and, in the absence of manifest error, will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the Holder of this Security. All percentages and other amounts resulting from any calculation with respect to this Security will be rounded at the Calculation Agent's discretion.
Tax Considerations
The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a beneficial ownership interest in this Security each Holder of this Security will be deemed to have agreed (in the absence of a statutory, regulatory, administrative or judicial ruling to the contrary), for United States federal income tax purposes to characterize and treat this Security as a pre-paid derivative contract in respect of the Index.
Redemption and Repayment
This Security is not subject to redemption at the option of the Company or repayment at the option of the Holder hereof prior to March 4, 2013. This Security is not entitled to any sinking fund.
Acceleration
If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to this Security shall occur and be continuing, the Redemption Amount (calculated as set forth in the next sentence) of this Security may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The amount payable to the Holder hereof upon any acceleration permitted under the Indenture will be equal to the Redemption Amount hereof calculated as provided herein as though the date of acceleration was the Calculation Day; provided, however, if such date is not a Trading Day or if a Market Disruption Event has occurred or is continuing on that day, the Calculation Day will be postponed as provided herein.
 
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature or its duly authorized agent under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.
