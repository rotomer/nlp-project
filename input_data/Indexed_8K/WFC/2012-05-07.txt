Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation ("DTC"), to the Issuer or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.
This Security is not a deposit or other obligation of a depository institution and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Deposit Insurance Fund or any other governmental agency.
 
WELLS FARGO & COMPANY, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (hereinafter called the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum                     DOLLARS ($                    ) on the Stated Maturity Date shown above (except to the extent redeemed or repaid
prior to such date) and to pay interest, if any, on the principal amount hereof from the Original Issue Date or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for on each Interest Payment Date set forth above, commencing on the Initial Interest Payment Date shown above, and at Maturity at the Interest Rate shown above (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months) until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Interest payable upon Maturity will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. The Regular Record Date for an Interest Payment Date shall be the fifteenth calendar day, whether or not a Business Day, prior to such Interest Payment Date.
If an Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, interest on this Security shall be payable on the next day that is a Business Day, with the same force and effect as if made on such Interest Payment Date, and without any interest or other payment with respect to the delay. If the date of Maturity would fall on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal and any premium and interest shall be made on the next Business Day, with the same force and effect as if made on the due date, and no additional interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such date of Maturity. For purposes of this Security, "Business Day" means a day other than a Saturday or Sunday, (i) that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law or regulation to close (a) in New York, New York or Minneapolis, Minnesota, (b) if this Security is denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, euro or Australian dollars, in the principal financial center of the country of the Specified Currency or (c) if this Security is denominated in Australian dollars, in Sydney, Australia and (ii) if this Security is denominated in euro, that is also a TARGET Settlement Day. For purposes of this Security, "TARGET Settlement Day" means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer System is open.
If this Security has been issued upon transfer of, in exchange for, or in replacement of, a Predecessor Security, interest on this Security shall accrue from the last Interest Payment Date to which interest was paid on such Predecessor Security or, if no interest was paid on such Predecessor Security, from the Original Issue Date specified above. The first payment of interest on a Security originally issued and dated between a Regular Record Date specified above and an Interest Payment Date will be due and payable on the Interest Payment Date following the next succeeding Regular Record Date to the registered owner on such next succeeding Regular Record Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Addendum is attached hereto or "Other/Additional Terms" apply to this Security as specified above, this Security shall be subject to the terms set forth in such Addendum or such "Other/Additional Terms."
The principal (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security is payable by the Company in the Specified Currency specified above.
 
Any interest not punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.
Payment of interest on this Security, other than payments of interest at Maturity, will be paid by check mailed to the Person entitled thereto at such Person's last address as it appears in the Security Register or by wire transfer to such account as may have been designated by such Person. Payment of principal of and interest on this Security at Maturity will be made against presentation of this Security at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the City of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for so long as this Security is a Global Security registered in the name of the Depositary, payments of principal and interest on this Security will be made to the Depositary by wire transfer of immediately available funds.
The Company will pay any administrative costs imposed by banks on payors in making payments on this Security in immediately available funds and the Holder of this Security will pay any administrative costs imposed by banks on payees in connection with such payments. Any tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed upon payments on this Security will be borne by the Holder of this Security.
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature or its duly authorized agent under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION
This is one of the Securities of the
series designated therein referred to
in the within-mentioned Indenture.
CITIBANK, N.A.,
        as Trustee
 
 
 
General
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture dated as of July 21, 1999, as amended or supplemented from time to time (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Citibank, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series of the Securities designated as Medium-Term Notes, Series I, of the Company, which series is limited to an aggregate principal amount of $25,000,000,000 or the equivalent thereof in one or more foreign or composite currencies minus the aggregate principal amount of the Company's Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series J which may be issued from time to time. The Securities of this series may mature at different times, bear interest, if any, at different rates, be redeemable at different times or not at all, be repayable at the option of the Holder at different times or not at all, be issued at an original issue discount and be denominated in different currencies.
The Securities are issuable only in registered form without coupons and will be either (a) book-entry securities represented by one or more Global Securities recorded in the book-entry system maintained by the Depositary or (b) certificated securities issued to and registered in the names of the beneficial owners or their nominees.
Events of Default
If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
Modification and Waivers
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the
 
time Outstanding of all series to be affected, acting together as a class. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding affected by certain provisions of the Indenture, acting together as a class, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with those provisions of the Indenture. Certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences may be waived under the Indenture by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (a) the entire indebtedness on this Security and (b) certain restrictive covenants and certain Events of Default, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Security.
Redemption
If so provided on the face hereof, the Company may at its option redeem this Security in whole or in part in increments of $1,000 (provided that any remaining principal amount of this Security shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination hereof) on or after the date or dates designated as the Redemption Date(s) on the face hereof at 100% of the unpaid principal amount hereof or the portion thereof redeemed, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date or, if a Redemption Price other than 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed is specified on the face hereof, the Redemption Price specified in the Addendum attached hereto. The Company may exercise such option by mailing a notice of such redemption to each Holder of the Securities of this series to be redeemed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the applicable Redemption Date. In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, the Company shall issue a new Security or Securities for the unredeemed portion hereof in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. If less than all of the Securities of this series with like tenor and terms are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and may provide for the selection for redemption of a portion of the principal amount of the Securities of this series held by a Holder equal to an authorized denomination. If this Security is a Global Security and if less than all of the Securities of this series are to be redeemed, the redemption shall be made in accordance with the Depositary's customary procedures. Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the applicable Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on this Security or portion hereof called for redemption.
 
Sinking Fund
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, this Security will not be entitled to any sinking fund.
Repayment
If so provided on the face hereof, this Security will be repayable prior to the Stated Maturity Date at the option of the Holder, in whole or in part and in increments of $1,000 (provided that any remaining principal amount of this Security surrendered for partial repayment shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination hereof), on or after the date designated as an Optional Repayment Date on the face hereof at 100% of the principal amount to be repaid, plus accrued interest, if any, to the Repayment Date or, if a Repayment Price other than 100% of the principal amount to be repaid is specified on the face hereof, at the Repayment Price specified in the Addendum attached hereto. In order for this Security to be repaid, the Paying Agent must receive at least 30 days but not more than 45 days prior to the Optional Repayment Date this Security with the form entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" on the reverse of this Security duly completed, or a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or a letter from a member of a national securities exchange, or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States setting forth: (a) the name of the Holder of this Security; (b) the principal amount of this Security; (c) the principal amount of this Security to be repaid; (d) the certificate number or a description of the tenor and terms of this Security; (e) a statement that the option to elect repayment is being exercised; and (f) a guarantee that this Security, together with the duly completed form entitled "Option to Elect Repayment," will be received by the Paying Agent not later than the fifth Business Day after the date of the telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter. However, the telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter will only be effective if this Security and form duly completed are received by the Paying Agent by the fifth Business Day after the date of that telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter.
Any repayment option exercised by the Holder of this Security shall be irrevocable. The repayment option may be exercised for less than the entire principal amount of this Security, but in that event the principal amount of this Security remaining outstanding after repayment must be equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof. Upon any partial repayment, this Security shall be cancelled and a new Security or Securities for the remaining principal amount hereof shall be issued in the name of the Holder of this Security. Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Repayment Price, on and after the applicable Repayment Date interest will cease to accrue on this Security or portion hereof requested to be repaid.
Authorized Denominations
Unless otherwise provided on the face hereof, this Security is issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
 
Registration of Transfer
Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Security at the office or agency of the Company in the City of Minneapolis, Minnesota, a new Security or Securities of this series in authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange herefor, as provided in the Indenture and subject to the limitations provided therein and to the limitations described below, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
If this Security is a Global Security (as specified above), this Security is exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form only if (x) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Security or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and a qualified successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, (y) the Company in its sole discretion determines that this Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form or elects to terminate the book-entry system through the Depositary and notifies the Trustee thereof or (z) an Event of Default with respect to the Securities represented hereby has occurred and is continuing. If this Security is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form, bearing interest at the same rate, having the same date of issuance, redemption provisions, Stated Maturity Date and other terms and of authorized denominations aggregating a like amount.
If this Security is a Global Security (as specified above), this Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor of the Depositary or a nominee of such successor. Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this Global Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form and will not be considered the Holders hereof for any purpose under the Indenture.
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.

Wells Fargo & Company
420 Montgomery Street
San Francisco, California 94163
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel for Wells Fargo & Company (the "Company") in connection with the preparation of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement") of the Company and Wells Fargo Capital XVI, Wells Fargo Capital XVII, Wells Fargo Capital XVIII, Wells Fargo Capital XIX and Wells Fargo Capital XX filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to the proposed offer and sale from time to time of the securities referred to therein, a Pricing Supplement dated April 30, 2012 (the "Pricing Supplement") to the Prospectus Supplement dated August 14, 2009 to the Prospectus dated June 4, 2009 (together, the "Prospectus") relating to the offer and sale by the Company under the Registration Statement of $1,500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Medium-Term Notes, Series I Fixed Rate Notes (the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued under the Indenture dated as of July 21, 1999 (the "Indenture") entered into by the Company and Citibank, N.A., as trustee, and sold pursuant to the Terms Agreement dated April 30, 2012 between the Company and the Agents named therein (the "Terms Agreement").
We have examined such documents, records, and instruments as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Notes have been duly authorized and, when duly executed by the Company, authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, and delivered to and paid for by the Agents pursuant to the Terms Agreement, the Notes will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance, receivership or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and subject to general equity principles including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith, fair dealing and the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and except further as enforcement thereof may be limited by any governmental authority that limits, delays or prohibits the making of payments outside of the United States. As contemplated by the foregoing qualifications, in rendering the foregoing opinion, we are expressing no opinion as to Federal or state laws relating to fraudulent transfers. Without limiting any other qualifications set forth herein, the opinions expressed herein are subject to the effect of generally applicable laws that limit the waiver of rights under usury laws.
