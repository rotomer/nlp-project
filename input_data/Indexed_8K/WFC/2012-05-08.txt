Anti-dilution Adjustments Relating To A Basket Component; Alternate Calculation
    Anti-dilution Adjustments
The Calculation Agent, in its sole discretion, may adjust the Adjustment Factor as a result of certain events related to a Basket Component or any Successor Fund, as applicable, which occur during the term of this Security. Such events include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
If a stock split or reverse stock split has occurred, then once such split has become effective, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the number of securities which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component before the effective date of such stock split or reverse stock split would have owned or been entitled to receive immediately following the applicable effective date.
 
If a (i) stock dividend (i.e., issuance of additional shares (or other applicable security) by a Basket Component) that is given ratably to all holders of record of shares (or other applicable security) of a Basket Component or (ii) distribution of shares (or other applicable security) of a Basket Component has occurred, then once the dividend has become effective and the shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component are trading ex-dividend, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted on the ex-dividend date to equal the prior Adjustment Factor plus the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the number of shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component before the date the dividend became effective and the shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component traded ex-dividend would have owned or been entitled to receive immediately following that date; provided, however, that no adjustment will be made for a distribution for which the number of securities of such Basket Component paid or distributed is based on a fixed cash equivalent value, unless such distribution is an Extraordinary Dividend as defined and discussed below.
 
If an Extraordinary Dividend (as defined below) has occurred, then on the ex-dividend date, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and a fraction, the numerator of which is the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date, and the denominator of which is the amount by which the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date exceeds the Extraordinary Dividend Amount (as defined below).
 
For purposes of determining whether an Extraordinary Dividend has occurred:
 
 
 
 
To the extent an Extraordinary Dividend is not paid in cash, the value of the non-cash component will be determined by the Calculation Agent. A distribution on the securities of such Basket Component described below under the sections entitled "Other Distributions" and "Reorganization Events" below that also constitute an Extraordinary Dividend will only cause an adjustment pursuant to those sections.
 
If a Basket Component declares or makes a distribution to all holders of the shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component of any class of its capital stock, evidences of its indebtedness or other non-cash assets, including, but not limited to, transferable rights and warrants, then, in each of these cases, the Adjustment Factor will equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and a fraction, the numerator of which will be the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component, and the denominator of which will be the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket
 
Component, less the fair market value, as determined by the Calculation Agent, as of the time the adjustment is effected of the portion of the capital shares, assets, evidences of indebtedness, rights or warrants so distributed or issued applicable to one share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component.
 
If a Basket Component, or any Successor Fund, is subject to a merger, combination, consolidation or statutory exchange of securities with another exchange traded fund, and such Basket Component is not the surviving entity, then, on or after the date of such event, the Calculation Agent shall, in its sole discretion, make an adjustment to the Adjustment Factor or the method of determining the Redemption Amount or any other terms of this Security as the Calculation Agent determines appropriate to account for the economic effect on this Security of such event (including adjustments to account for changes in volatility, expected dividends, stock loan rate or liquidity relevant to this Security), and determine the effective date of that adjustment. If the Calculation Agent determines that no adjustment that it could make will produce a commercially reasonable result, then the Calculation Agent may deem such event a Liquidation Event (as defined below).
    Liquidation Events
If a Basket Component is de-listed, liquidated or otherwise terminated (a ""), and a successor or substitute exchange traded fund exists that the Calculation Agent determines, in its sole discretion, to be comparable to such Basket Component, then, upon the Calculation Agent's notification of that determination to the Trustee and the Company, any subsequent Fund Closing Price for such Basket Component will be determined by reference to the Fund Closing Price of such successor or substitute exchange traded fund (such exchange traded fund being referred to herein as a "").
Liquidation Event
Successor Fund
Upon any selection by the Calculation Agent of a Successor Fund, the Company will cause notice to be given to Holder of this Security.
If a Basket Component undergoes a Liquidation Event prior to, and such Liquidation Event is continuing on, the date that the Fund Closing Price of such Basket Component is to be determined and the Calculation Agent determines that no Successor Fund is available at such time, then the Calculation Agent will, in its discretion, calculate the Fund Closing Price for such Basket Component on such date by a computation methodology that the Calculation Agent determines will as closely as reasonably possible replicate such Basket Component.
If a Successor Fund is selected or the Calculation Agent calculates the Fund Closing Price as a substitute for a Basket Component, such Successor Fund or Fund Closing Price will be used as a substitute for such Basket Component for all purposes, including for purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event exists.
 
If at any time the method of calculating a Basket Component or a Successor Fund, or the related Underlying Index, is changed in a material respect, or if a Basket Component or a Successor Fund is in any other way modified so that such Basket Component does not, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent, fairly represent the price of the securities of such Basket Component or such Successor Fund had such changes or modifications not been made, then the Calculation Agent will, at the close of business in New York City on the date that the Fund Closing Price is to be determined, make such calculations and adjustments as, in the good faith judgment of the Calculation Agent, may be necessary in order to arrive at a Closing Price of an exchange traded fund comparable to such Basket Component or Successor Fund, as the case may be, as if such changes or modifications had not been made, and calculate the Fund Closing Price and the Redemption Amount with reference to such adjusted Closing Price of such Basket Component or such Successor Fund, as applicable.
Calculation Agent
The Calculation Agent will determine the Redemption Amount and the Ending Price. In addition, the Calculation Agent will (i) determine if adjustments are required to the Fund Closing Price and/or the Adjustment Factor of a Basket Component under the circumstances described in this Security, (ii) if a Basket Component undergoes a Liquidation Event, select a Successor Fund or, if no Successor Fund is available, determine the Fund Closing Price of such Basket Component, and (iii) determine whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred.
The Company covenants that, so long as this Security is Outstanding, there shall at all times be a Calculation Agent (which shall be a broker-dealer, bank or other financial institution) with respect to this Security.
All determinations made by the Calculation Agent with respect to this Security will be at the sole discretion of the Calculation Agent and, in the absence of manifest error, will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the Holder of this Security. All percentages and other amounts resulting from any calculation with respect to this Security will be rounded at the Calculation Agent's discretion.
Tax Considerations
The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a beneficial ownership interest in this Security each Holder of this Security will be deemed to have agreed (in the absence of a statutory, regulatory, administrative or judicial ruling to the contrary), for United States federal income tax purposes to characterize and treat this Security as a pre-paid derivative contract in respect of the Basket.
Redemption and Repayment
This Security is not subject to redemption at the option of the Company or repayment at the option of the Holder hereof prior to November 6, 2015. This Security is not entitled to any sinking fund.
 
Acceleration
If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to this Security shall occur and be continuing, the Redemption Amount (calculated as set forth in the next sentence) of this Security may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The amount payable to the Holder hereof upon any acceleration permitted under the Indenture will be equal to the Redemption Amount hereof calculated as provided herein as though the date of acceleration was the Calculation Day; provided, however, if such date is not a Trading Day or if a Market Disruption Event has occurred or is continuing on that day, the Calculation Day will be postponed as provided herein.
 
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature or its duly authorized agent under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

Market Disruption Event
 
 
 
 
 
For purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred:
 
 
Anti-dilution Adjustments Relating To A Basket Component; Alternate Calculation
Anti-dilution Adjustments
The Calculation Agent, in its sole discretion, may adjust the Adjustment Factor as a result of certain events related to a Basket Component or any Successor Fund, as applicable, which occur during the term of this Security. Such events include, but are not limited to, the following:
(A)
Stock Splits and Reverse Stock Splits
If a stock split or reverse stock split has occurred, then once such split has become effective, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the number of securities which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component before the effective date of such stock split or reverse stock split would have owned or been entitled to receive immediately following the applicable effective date.
(B)
Stock Dividends
If a (i) stock dividend (i.e., issuance of additional shares (or other applicable security) by a Basket Component) that is given ratably to all holders of record of shares (or other applicable security) of a Basket Component or (ii) distribution of shares (or other applicable security) of a Basket Component has occurred, then once the dividend has become effective and the shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component are trading ex-dividend, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted on the ex-dividend date to equal the prior Adjustment Factor plus the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the number of shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component before the date the dividend became effective and the shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component traded ex-dividend would have owned or been entitled to receive immediately following that date; provided, however, that no adjustment will be made for a distribution for which the number of securities of such Basket Component paid or distributed is based on a fixed cash equivalent value, unless such distribution is an Extraordinary Dividend as defined and discussed below.
 
(C)
Extraordinary Dividends
If an Extraordinary Dividend (as defined below) has occurred, then on the ex-dividend date, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and a fraction, the numerator of which is the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date, and the denominator of which is the amount by which the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date exceeds the Extraordinary Dividend Amount (as defined below).
For purposes of determining whether an Extraordinary Dividend has occurred:
 
 
 
 
To the extent an Extraordinary Dividend is not paid in cash, the value of the non-cash component will be determined by the Calculation Agent. A distribution on the securities of such Basket Component described below under the sections entitled "Other Distributions" and "Reorganization Events" below that also constitute an Extraordinary Dividend will only cause an adjustment pursuant to those sections.
 
(D)
Other Distributions
If a Basket Component declares or makes a distribution to all holders of the shares (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component of any class of its capital stock, evidences of its indebtedness or other non-cash assets, including, but not limited to, transferable rights and warrants, then, in each of these cases, the Adjustment Factor will equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and a fraction, the numerator of which will be the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component, and the denominator of which will be the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component, less the fair market value, as determined by the Calculation Agent, as of the time the adjustment is effected of the portion of the capital shares, assets, evidences of indebtedness, rights or warrants so distributed or issued applicable to one share (or other applicable security) of such Basket Component.
(E)
Reorganization Events
If a Basket Component, or any Successor Fund, is subject to a merger, combination, consolidation or statutory exchange of securities with another exchange traded fund, and such Basket Component is not the surviving entity, then, on or after the date of such event, the Calculation Agent shall, in its sole discretion, make an adjustment to the Adjustment Factor or the method of determining the Redemption Amount or any other terms of this Security as the Calculation Agent determines appropriate to account for the economic effect on this Security of such event (including adjustments to account for changes in volatility, expected dividends, stock loan rate or liquidity relevant to this Security), and determine the effective date of that adjustment. If the Calculation Agent determines that no adjustment that it could make will produce a commercially reasonable result, then the Calculation Agent may deem such event a Liquidation Event (as defined below).
Liquidation Events
If a Basket Component is de-listed, liquidated or otherwise terminated (a ""), and a successor or substitute exchange traded fund exists that the Calculation Agent determines, in its sole discretion, to be comparable to such Basket Component, then, upon the Calculation Agent's notification of that determination to the Trustee and the Company, any subsequent Fund Closing Price for such Basket Component will be determined by reference to the Fund Closing Price of such successor or substitute exchange traded fund (such exchange traded fund being referred to herein as a "").
Liquidation Event
Successor Fund
Upon any selection by the Calculation Agent of a Successor Fund, the Company will cause notice to be given to Holder of this Security.
 
If a Basket Component undergoes a Liquidation Event prior to, and such Liquidation Event is continuing on, the date that the Fund Closing Price of such Basket Component is to be determined and the Calculation Agent determines that no Successor Fund is available at such time, then the Calculation Agent will, in its discretion, calculate the Fund Closing Price for such Basket Component on such date by a computation methodology that the Calculation Agent determines will as closely as reasonably possible replicate such Basket Component.
If a Successor Fund is selected or the Calculation Agent calculates the Fund Closing Price as a substitute for a Basket Component, such Successor Fund or Fund Closing Price will be used as a substitute for such Basket Component for all purposes, including for purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event exists.
If at any time the method of calculating a Basket Component or a Successor Fund, or the related Underlying Index, is changed in a material respect, or if a Basket Component or a Successor Fund is in any other way modified so that such Basket Component does not, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent, fairly represent the price of the securities of such Basket Component or such Successor Fund had such changes or modifications not been made, then the Calculation Agent will, at the close of business in New York City on the date that the Fund Closing Price is to be determined, make such calculations and adjustments as, in the good faith judgment of the Calculation Agent, may be necessary in order to arrive at a Closing Price of an exchange traded fund comparable to such Basket Component or Successor Fund, as the case may be, as if such changes or modifications had not been made, and calculate the Fund Closing Price and the Redemption Amount with reference to such adjusted Closing Price of such Basket Component or such Successor Fund, as applicable.
Calculation Agent
The Calculation Agent will determine the Redemption Amount and the Ending Price. In addition, the Calculation Agent will (i) determine if adjustments are required to the Fund Closing Price and/or the Adjustment Factor of a Basket Component under the circumstances described in this Security, (ii) if a Basket Component undergoes a Liquidation Event, select a Successor Fund or, if no Successor Fund is available, determine the Fund Closing Price of such Basket Component, and (iii) determine whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred.
The Company covenants that, so long as this Security is Outstanding, there shall at all times be a Calculation Agent (which shall be a broker-dealer, bank or other financial institution) with respect to this Security.
All determinations made by the Calculation Agent with respect to this Security will be at the sole discretion of the Calculation Agent and, in the absence of manifest error, will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the Holder of this Security. All percentages and other amounts resulting from any calculation with respect to this Security will be rounded at the Calculation Agent's discretion.
Tax Considerations
The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a beneficial ownership interest in this Security each Holder of this Security will be deemed to have agreed (in the absence of a statutory, regulatory, administrative or judicial ruling to the contrary), for United States federal income tax purposes to characterize and treat this Security as a pre-paid derivative contract in respect of the Basket.
 
Redemption and Repayment
This Security is not subject to redemption at the option of the Company or repayment at the option of the Holder hereof prior to November 7, 2016. This Security is not entitled to any sinking fund.
Acceleration
If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to this Security shall occur and be continuing, the Redemption Amount (calculated as set forth in the next sentence) of this Security may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The amount payable to the Holder hereof upon any acceleration permitted under the Indenture will be equal to the Redemption Amount hereof calculated as provided herein as though the date of acceleration was the Calculation Day; provided, however, if such date is not a Trading Day or if a Market Disruption Event has occurred or is continuing on that day, the Calculation Day will be postponed as provided herein.
  
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature or its duly authorized agent under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

Authorized Denominations
This Security is issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 or any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000.
Repayment upon Exercise of Survivor's Option
The Company has agreed to repay beneficial ownership interests in this Security, if requested by the authorized representative of the beneficial owner of such beneficial ownership interest following the death of the beneficial owner, so long as the beneficial ownership interest in this Security was acquired by the beneficial owner at least six months prior to the request (the "").
Survivor's Option
Upon the valid exercise of the Survivor's Option and the proper tender of a beneficial ownership interest in this Security for repayment, the Company will repay such beneficial ownership interest in this Security, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the deceased beneficial owner's beneficial interest in this Security, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repayment.
To be valid, the Survivor's Option must be exercised by or on behalf of the Person who has authority to act on behalf of a deceased beneficial owner of this Security under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction (including, without limitation, the personal representative of or the executor of the estate of the deceased beneficial owner or the surviving joint owner with the deceased beneficial owner).
A beneficial owner of this Security is a Person who has the right, immediately prior to such Person's death, to receive the proceeds from the disposition of such beneficial owner's interest in this Security, as well as the right to receive the principal amount of the deceased beneficial owner's interest in this Security plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon.
 
The death of a Person holding a beneficial ownership interest in this Security as a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety with another Person, or as a tenant in common with the deceased holder's spouse, will be deemed the death of a beneficial owner of that beneficial ownership interest in this Security, and the entire principal amount of the deceased beneficial owner's interest in this Security held in this manner will be subject to repayment by the Company upon exercise of the Survivor's Option. However, the death of a Person holding a beneficial ownership interest in this Security as tenant in common with a Person other than such deceased holder's spouse will be deemed the death of a beneficial owner only with respect to such deceased Person's interest in this Security, and only the deceased beneficial owner's percentage interest in that beneficial ownership interest in the principal amount of this Security will be subject to repayment.
The death of a Person who, during his or her lifetime, was entitled to substantially all of the beneficial ownership interests in this Security will be deemed the death of the beneficial owner of this Security for purposes of the Survivor's Option, regardless of whether that beneficial owner was the registered holder of this Security, if the beneficial ownership interest can be established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent. A beneficial ownership interest will be deemed to exist in typical cases of nominee ownership, ownership under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act or Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, community property, or other joint ownership arrangements between a husband and wife. In addition, the beneficial ownership interest in this Security will be deemed to exist in custodial and trust arrangements where one Person has all of the beneficial ownership interest in this Security during his or her lifetime. In the case of a joint trust, the joint tenant rules above will apply to the respective beneficial ownership interests.
The Company has the discretionary right to limit the aggregate principal amount of this Security as to which exercises of the Survivor's Option will be accepted by the Company from the authorized representative for any individual deceased beneficial owner of this Security in any calendar year to $500,000. In addition, the Company will not permit the exercise of the Survivor's Option for any portion of this Security with a principal amount of less than $1,000, and the Company will not permit the exercise of the Survivor's Option if such exercise will result in this Security having a principal amount that is not an integral multiple of $1,000.
An otherwise valid election to exercise the Survivor's Option may not be withdrawn. An election to exercise the Survivor's Option will be accepted in the order that it was received by the Paying Agent, except for any beneficial ownership interest in this Security the acceptance of which would contravene the limitation described above. Beneficial ownership interests in this Security accepted for repayment through the exercise of the Survivor's Option normally will be repaid on the first Interest Payment Date that occurs 20 or more calendar days after the date of the acceptance. Each tendered beneficial ownership interest in this Security that is not accepted in a calendar year due to the application of the limitation described in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to be tendered in the following calendar year in the order in which all such beneficial interests were originally tendered. If a beneficial ownership interest in this Security tendered through a valid exercise of the Survivor's Option is not accepted, the Paying Agent will deliver a notice by first-class mail to the registered holder, at that registered holder's last known address as indicated in the Security Register, that states the reason that the beneficial ownership interest in this Security has not been accepted for repayment.
 
Since this Security is a Global Security, DTC, as depository, or its nominee will be treated as the holder of this Security and will be the only entity that can exercise the Survivor's Option. To obtain repayment of this Security pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option, the deceased beneficial owner's authorized representative must provide the following items to the broker or other entity through which the beneficial interest in this Security is held by the deceased beneficial owner:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In turn, the broker or other entity will deliver each of these items to the Paying Agent and will certify to the Paying Agent that the broker or other entity represents the deceased beneficial owner.
The Company retains the right to limit the aggregate principal amount of this Security as to which exercises of the Survivor's Option will be accepted by the Company from the authorized representative for any individual deceased beneficial owner in this Security in any calendar year as described above. All other questions regarding the eligibility or validity of any exercise of the Survivor's Option will be determined by the Paying Agent, in its sole discretion, which determination will be final and binding on all parties.
 
The broker or other entity will be responsible for disbursing payments received from the Paying Agent to the authorized representative. Forms for the exercise of the Survivor's Option may be obtained from the Paying Agent.
Registration of Transfer
Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Security at the office or agency of the Company in the City of Minneapolis, Minnesota, a new Security or Securities of this series, with the same terms as this Security, in authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange herefor, as provided in the Indenture and subject to the limitations provided therein and to the limitations described below, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
This Security is exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form only if (x) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Security or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and a successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, (y) the Company in its sole discretion determines that this Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form and notifies the Trustee thereof or (z) an Event of Default with respect to the Securities represented hereby has occurred and is continuing. If this Security is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form, bearing interest at the same rate, having the same date of issuance, Stated Maturity Date and other terms and of authorized denominations aggregating a like amount.
This Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor of the Depositary or a nominee of such successor. Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this Global Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form and will not be considered the Holders hereof for any purpose under the Indenture.
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Obligation of the Company Absolute
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed, except as otherwise provided in this Security.
 
No Personal Recourse
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.
Defined Terms
All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture unless otherwise defined in this Security.
Governing Law
This Security shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.

We have examined such documents, records and instruments as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Notes have been duly authorized and, when duly executed by the Company, authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, and delivered to and paid for by the Agent pursuant to the Terms Agreement, the Notes will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance, receivership or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and subject to general equity principles including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith, fair dealing and the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and except further as enforcement thereof may be limited by any governmental authority that limits, delays or prohibits the making of payments outside of the United States. As contemplated by the foregoing qualifications, in rendering the foregoing opinion, we are expressing no opinion as to Federal or state laws relating to fraudulent transfers.
