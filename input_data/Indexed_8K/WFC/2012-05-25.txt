Exhibit 1.1
May 25, 2012
To the Agent listed in Exhibit A hereto
and each person that shall have become
an Agent as provided in Section 1(e) of this Agreement
Dear Sirs and Mesdames:
Wells Fargo & Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), confirms its agreement with each of you (individually, each an "Agent", and collectively, the "Agents") with respect to the issuance and sale by the Company of its Medium-Term Notes described herein (collectively, the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued pursuant to an indenture (the "Senior Indenture") dated as of July 21, 1999, as amended from time to time, between the Company and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the "Senior Trustee"), or an indenture (the "Subordinated Indenture" and together with the Senior Indenture, referred to herein collectively as the "Indentures") dated as of August 30, 1999, as amended from time to time, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association (as successor in interest to The First National Bank of Chicago), as trustee (the "Subordinated Trustee" and together with the Senior Trustee, referred to herein collectively as the "Trustees"). As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has authorized the issuance and sale of up to U.S. $25,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount (or its equivalent, based upon the applicable exchange rate at the time of issuance, in such foreign currencies or foreign currency units as the Company shall designate at the time of issuance) of the Notes through the Agents pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. It is understood, however, that the Company may from time to time authorize the issuance of additional Notes and that such additional Notes may be sold pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, all as though the issuance of such Notes were authorized as of the date of this Agreement.
This Agreement provides both for the sale of the Notes by the Company directly to purchasers, in which case the Agents will act as agents of the Company in soliciting Note purchases, and (as may from time to time be agreed to by the Company and any Agent) to any Agent as principal for resale to purchasers.
The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-180989), as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") for the registration of securities, including the Notes, under the Securities Act, and the offering thereof from time to time
in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the SEC under the Securities Act (the "Securities Act Regulations"). Such registration statement, including any amendments thereto, became effective upon filing. Each of the Indentures has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"). The Company proposes to file with the SEC, pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act, a supplement to a form of prospectus included in such registration statement relating to the Notes in the form heretofore delivered to you. Such registration statement, including all exhibits thereto (but excluding the Statements of Eligibility on Form T-1), as amended at the date of this Agreement, and including any prospectus supplement relating to the Notes that is filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act and deemed part of such registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act, is hereinafter called the "Registration Statement"; such prospectus in the form in which it appears in the Registration Statement is hereinafter called the "Basic Prospectus;" the Basic Prospectus, as amended or supplemented by such prospectus supplement with respect to the Notes and Pricing Supplements (as defined in Section 3(a) of this Agreement), if any, setting forth the terms of the Notes, in the form filed or, in the case of the Pricing Supplements, to be filed, with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) is hereinafter called the "Final Prospectus." Any preliminary form of the Final Prospectus which has been or will be filed pursuant to Rule 424 is hereinafter called the "Preliminary Final Prospectus." The term "Free Writing Prospectus" shall mean a free writing prospectus, as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act. The term "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus" shall mean an issuer free writing prospectus, as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act, that (i) is required to be filed with the SEC by the Company or (ii) is exempt from filing pursuant to Rule 433(d)(5)(i) because it contains a description of the Notes or the offering that does not reflect the final terms. The term "Applicable Time" in respect of a tranche of Notes shall mean the time at or prior to the confirmation of any sales of such Notes, as agreed between the Company and the Agents to whom or through whom such Notes are being sold (i) in a Terms Agreement (hereinafter defined) or (ii) pursuant to any other agreement of the Company and such Agents. The term "Disclosure Package," as it relates to any tranche of Notes, shall mean the Final Prospectus, as amended and supplemented to the Applicable Time, each Preliminary Final Prospectus, if any, each Pricing Supplement prepared pursuant to Section 4(d), if any, and any Free Writing Prospectus that the Company and an Agent shall expressly agree in writing to treat as part of such Disclosure Package, in each case relating to such tranche of Notes at the relevant Applicable Time. Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and a Disclosure Package shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents filed by the Company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and incorporated therein as of the date of this Agreement or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or the relevant Applicable Time, as the case may be. Any reference herein to the terms "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the date of this Agreement, or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be, and deemed to be incorporated therein by reference.
 
The Company agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the applicable Agents, and each Agent, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Notes that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a Free Writing Prospectus required to be filed with the SEC or retained by the Company under Rule 433 under the Securities Act. Any such Free Writing Prospectus consented to by the Agents or the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (i) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (ii) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 under the Securities Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the SEC, legending and record keeping.
SECTION 1. .
Appointment as Agents
(a) . Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and subject to the reservation by the Company of the right to (i) cause Additional Agents (as defined below) to become Agents under this Agreement or enter into similar agreements from time to time pursuant to Section 1(e) of this Agreement and (ii) sell Notes directly on its own behalf or through any of its affiliated entities and other agents, the Company hereby appoints the Agents as the agents for the purpose of soliciting purchases of the Notes from the Company by others and agrees that, except as otherwise contemplated herein, whenever the Company determines to sell Notes directly to any Agent as principal for resale to others, it will enter into a Terms Agreement relating to such sale in accordance with Section 3(b) of this Agreement. No Notes that the Company has agreed to sell pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to have been purchased and paid for or sold by the Company until such Notes shall have been delivered to the purchaser thereof against payment by such purchaser. The Company may accept offers to purchase Notes through an agent other than an Agent; , that the maximum commission received by any such agent will not exceed 8.00%.
Appointment of Agents
provided, however
(b) . Upon receipt of instructions from the Company, each of the Agents will use its reasonable efforts to solicit purchases of such principal amount of the Notes as the Company and such Agent shall agree upon from time to time during the term of this Agreement, it being understood that the Company shall not approve the solicitation of purchases of Notes in excess of the amount which shall be authorized by the Company, from time to time. The Agents will have no responsibility for maintaining records with respect to the aggregate principal amount of Notes sold. Each Agent will communicate to the Company, orally or in writing, each offer to purchase Notes, other than those offers rejected by such Agent. Each Agent shall have the right, in its discretion reasonably exercised, to reject any proposed purchase of the Notes, in whole or in part, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach by such Agent of this Agreement. The Company may accept or reject any proposed purchase of the Notes, in whole or in part.
Reasonable Efforts Solicitations; Right to Reject Offers
(c) . In soliciting purchases of Notes on behalf of the Company and in performing its other obligations hereunder (other than with respect to any purchase by an Agent as principal pursuant to a Terms Agreement), each Agent shall act solely as agent for the Company and not as principal. Each Agent shall make reasonable efforts
Solicitations as Agent; Purchases as Principal
 
to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase the Notes has been solicited by such Agent and accepted by the Company; , that such Agent shall not have any liability to the Company in the event any such purchase is not consummated for any reason. If the Company shall default on its obligation to deliver Notes to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall pay to such Agent the commission it would have received had such sale been consummated and the Company shall hold such Agent harmless against any other loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default by the Company. Each purchase of Notes solicited by an Agent as agent shall be confirmed by such Agent and the Company in writing by facsimile transmission or otherwise at or about, or prior to, the Applicable Time. The Agents shall not have any obligation to purchase Notes from the Company as principal, but any Agent may agree, from time to time, to purchase Notes as principal. Any such purchase of Notes by an Agent as principal shall be made in accordance with Section 3(b) of this Agreement.
provided, however
(d) . The Company and the Agents agree that any Notes, the placement of which any Agent arranges, shall be placed by such Agent, and any Notes purchased by such Agent shall be purchased, in reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company contained herein and on the terms and conditions and in the manner provided herein.
Reliance
(e) . The Company may from time to time appoint one or more additional financial institutions experienced in the distribution of securities similar to the Notes (each such additional institution herein referred to as an "Additional Agent") as agent(s) hereunder pursuant to an agreement between the Company and the Additional Agents (an "Agent Accession Agreement"), whereupon each such Additional Agent shall, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Agent Accession Agreement, become a party to this Agreement as an Agent, vested with all the authority, rights and powers and subject to all the duties and obligations of an Agent as if originally named as an Agent hereunder.

Solicitations as Agent
The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend solicitation of purchases of the Notes through any Agent, as agent, commencing at any time for any period of time or permanently. Upon receipt of at least one business day's prior notice from the Company, such Agent will forthwith suspend solicitation of offers to purchase Notes from the Company until such time as the Company has advised such Agent that such solicitation may be resumed. While such solicitation is suspended, the Company shall not be required to deliver any certificates, opinions or letters in accordance with Sections 7(a), (b) and (c) of this Agreement; , that if the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the applicable Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus is amended or supplemented during the period of suspension (other than by an amendment or supplement providing solely for a change in the interest rates, redemption provisions, amortization schedules or maturities offered on the Notes or for a change the Agents deem to be immaterial), no Agent shall be required to resume soliciting offers to purchase the Notes until the Company has delivered such certificates, opinions and letters as such Agent may request.

Legal Opinions
1. . The opinion of Mary E. Schaffner, Senior Company Counsel of the Company, or another of the Company's lawyers satisfactory to the Agents, to the effect that:
Opinion of Company Counsel
(i) The Company has been duly incorporated and is a validly existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
(ii) The Company has the corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Final Prospectus, and is duly registered as a financial holding company and a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended; Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ("Wells Fargo Bank") is a national banking association authorized to transact the business of banking under the National Bank Act of 1864, as amended; and WFC Holdings Corporation ("WFC Holdings," and together with Wells Fargo Bank, the "Significant Subsidiaries") is a duly organized and validly existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
(iii) Each of the Company and the Significant Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction which requires such qualification wherein it owns or leases any material properties or conducts any material business, except where the failure to so qualify would not have any material adverse effect upon the business, condition or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
(iv) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each Significant Subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and (except as provided in 12 U.S.C. 55 in the case of Wells Fargo Bank) nonassessable, and are directly or indirectly owned by the Company free and clear of any perfected security interest and, to the knowledge of such counsel, any other security interests, claims, liens or encumbrances. The Company's authorized equity capitalization is as set forth in the Final Prospectus.
(v) This Agreement has been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
 
(vi) Each of the Indentures has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming such Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Senior Trustee or the Subordinated Trustee, as applicable) constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and except further as enforcement thereof may be limited by (A) requirements that a claim with respect to any Notes denominated other than in U.S. dollars (or a foreign currency or foreign currency unit judgment in respect of such claim) be converted into United States dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on a date determined pursuant to applicable law or (B) governmental authority to limit, delay or prohibit the making of payments in foreign currency or currency units or the making of payments outside the United States.
(vii) The Notes are in due and proper form and have been duly established in conformity with Section 301 of the applicable Indenture. When the specific terms of a tranche of Notes have been fixed by an authorized officer of the Company by executing and delivering to the Senior Trustee or the Subordinated Trustee, as applicable, an authentication certificate supplemental to an officers' certificate, such Notes will be duly authorized for issuance, offer and sale pursuant to this Agreement and, when issued, authenticated and delivered pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and the applicable Indenture against payment of the consideration therefor, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equity principles (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and except further as enforcement thereof may be limited by (A) requirements that a claim with respect to any Notes denominated other than in U.S. dollars (or a foreign currency or foreign currency unit judgment in respect of such claim) be converted into United States dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on a date determined pursuant to applicable law or (B) governmental authority to limit, delay or prohibit the making of payments in foreign currency or currency units or payments outside the United States, and each holder of Notes will be entitled to the benefits of the applicable Indenture.
 
(viii) The statements in the Final Prospectus (other than statements furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of an Agent expressly for use therein) under the captions "Description of Debt Securities," "Plan of Distribution (Conflicts of Interest)," "Description of Notes" and "Supplemental Plan of Distribution (Conflicts of Interest)," insofar as they purport to summarize certain provisions of documents or laws specifically referred to therein, are accurate summaries of such provisions or laws or of the sources from which such summaries were derived (other than the foreign selling restrictions set forth under the caption "Plan of Distribution (Conflicts of Interest)," as to which no opinion need be rendered).
(ix) Each of the Indentures is qualified under the Trust Indenture Act.
(x) The Registration Statement is effective under the Securities Act and, to the knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as amended, or any notice under Rule 401(g)(2) that would prevent its use, has been issued under the Securities Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been initiated or, to the knowledge of such counsel, threatened by the SEC; and any required filing of the Final Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) will be made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act.
(xi) The Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and each amendment thereof or supplement thereto as of their respective effective or issue dates (other than financial statements and other financial and statistical information contained therein, other than statements furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of an Agent and other than the Statements of Eligibility on Form T-1 included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which no opinion need be rendered) complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Trust Indenture Act and the regulations under each of those Acts.
(xii) To such counsel's knowledge, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened which are required to be disclosed in the Final Prospectus, other than those disclosed therein.
 
(xiii) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or of the Indentures, nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Notes nor the incurrence of the obligations therein contemplated, will conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default under, any indenture or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any Significant Subsidiary is a party or bound and which constitutes a material contract and is set forth as an exhibit to the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K, or any other indenture or material agreement or instrument known to such counsel and to which the Company or any Significant Subsidiary is a party or bound, the breach of which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or violate any order or regulation known to such counsel to be applicable to the Company or any Significant Subsidiary of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body, or arbitrator having jurisdiction over the Company or any Significant Subsidiary; nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company.
(xiv) To such counsel's knowledge, there are no contracts, indentures, mortgages, loan agreements, notes, leases or other instruments or documents required to be described or referred to in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement other than those described or referred to therein or filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits thereto, and the descriptions thereof or references thereto are correct.
(xv) No consent, approval, authorization, order or decree of any court or governmental agency or body including the SEC is required for the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except such as may be required under the Blue Sky laws of any jurisdiction or regulations adopted by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA") in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Notes by the Agents.
(xvi) Each document filed pursuant to the Exchange Act and incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus complied when filed as to form in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the Exchange Act Regulations thereunder (other than financial statements and other financial and statistical information included therein, other than statements furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Agents and other than the Statements of Eligibility on Form T-1 included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which no opinion need be rendered).

(b) . On the date of this Agreement, the Agents shall have received a certificate signed by any Senior Vice President or Executive Vice President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company (provided that no person shall sign such certificate in more than one official capacity) dated as of the date of this Agreement, to the effect that
Officer's Certificates
 
(i) since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Final Prospectus, there has not been any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business, properties or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus,
(ii) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 2 of this Agreement are true and correct with the same force and effect as though expressly made at and as of the date of such certificate,

(c) . On the date of this Agreement, the Agents shall have received a letter from KPMG LLP, dated as of the date of this Agreement and containing statements and information as agreed to between the Agent and KPMG LLP.
Comfort Letter
(d) . On the date of this Agreement (and on each Settlement Date with respect to any applicable Terms Agreement), counsel to the Agents shall have been furnished with such documents and opinions as such counsel may reasonably require for the purpose of enabling such counsel to pass upon the issuance and sale of Notes as herein contemplated and related proceedings, or in order to evidence the accuracy and completeness of any of the representations and warranties, or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained; and all proceedings taken by the Company in connection with the issuance and sale of Notes as herein contemplated shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the Agents and to counsel for the Agents.
Other Documents
(e) . There shall have been no material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business, properties, results of operations or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not in the ordinary course of business, from that set forth in the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of the date of such solicitation, and in the applicable Disclosure Package or since the date of such Terms Agreement that, in the judgment of such Agent, is material and adverse and makes it, in the judgment of such Agent, impracticable to proceed with the solicitation of offers to purchase Notes or the purchase by such Agent of Notes from the Company pursuant to such Terms Agreement, as the case may be.
Material Adverse Change
 
If any condition specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled when and as required to be fulfilled, this Agreement (or, at the option of any Agent, any applicable Terms Agreement) may be terminated by any Agent insofar as this Agreement relates to such Agent by notice to the Company at any time and any such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party, except that the covenant regarding provision of an earnings statement set forth in Section 4(h) of this Agreement, the provisions concerning payment of expenses under Section 10 of this Agreement, the indemnity and contribution agreement set forth in Sections 8 and 9 of this Agreement, the provisions concerning the representations, warranties and agreements to survive delivery of Section 11 of this Agreement and the provisions set forth in Sections 14, 15 and 16 of this Agreement shall remain in effect.
SECTION 6. .
Delivery of and Payment for Notes Sold through the Agents
Delivery of Notes sold through any Agent as agent shall be made by the Company to such Agent for the account of any purchaser only against payment therefor in immediately available funds. In the event that a purchaser shall fail either to accept delivery of or to make payment for a Note on the date fixed for settlement, the presenting Agent shall promptly notify the Company and deliver the Note to the Company, and, if such Agent has theretofore paid the Company for such Note, the Company will promptly return such funds to such Agent. If such failure occurred for any reason other than default by such Agent in the performance of its obligations hereunder, the Company will reimburse such Agent on an equitable basis for its loss of the use of the funds for the period such funds were credited to the Company's account.
SECTION 7. .
Additional Covenants of the Company
The Company covenants and agrees with each Agent that:
(a) . If so requested by such Agent, each time that the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented (other than by a Pricing Supplement, and other than by an amendment or supplement which relates exclusively to an offering of securities other than the Notes) or there is filed with the SEC any document incorporated by reference into the Final Prospectus, or (if required pursuant to the terms of a Terms Agreement) the Company sells Notes to any Agent pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to such Agent forthwith a certificate dated the date of filing with the SEC of such supplement or document, the date of effectiveness of such amendment, or the date of such sale, as the case may be, in form satisfactory to such Agent to the effect that the statements contained in the certificate referred to in Section 5(b) of this Agreement which were last furnished to such Agent are true and correct at the time of such amendment, supplement, filing or sale, as the case may be, as though made at and as of such time (except that such statements shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, as amended and supplemented to such time, and the applicable Disclosure Package (if such certificate is required by a Terms Agreement)), or, in lieu of such certificate, a certificate of the same tenor as
Subsequent Delivery of Certificates
 
the certificate referred to in said Section 5(b), modified as necessary to relate to the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, as amended and supplemented to the time of delivery of such certificate, and such Disclosure Package; , that any certificate delivered pursuant to this Section 7(a) need not contain the statements set forth in clause (v) of Section 5(b).
provided, however
(b) . If so requested by such Agent, each time that the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented (other than by a Pricing Supplement or solely for the inclusion of additional financial information, and other than by an amendment or supplement which relates exclusively to an offering of securities other than the Notes) or there is filed with the SEC any document incorporated by reference into the Final Prospectus, or (if required pursuant to the terms of a Terms Agreement) the Company sells Notes to any Agent pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished forthwith to such Agent and to counsel to such Agent a written opinion of the Senior Company Counsel of the Company, or other counsel satisfactory to such Agent, dated the date of filing with the SEC of such supplement or document, the date of effectiveness of such amendment, or the date of such sale, as the case may be, in form and substance satisfactory to such Agent, of the same tenor as the opinion referred to in Section 5(a)(1) of this Agreement, but modified, as necessary, to relate to the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, as amended and supplemented to the time of delivery of such opinion, and the applicable Disclosure Package (if such opinion is required by a Terms Agreement); or, in lieu of such opinion, counsel last furnishing such opinion to such Agent shall furnish each Agent with a letter to the effect that the Agents may rely on such last opinion to the same extent as though it was dated the date of such letter authorizing reliance (except that statements in such last opinion shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, as amended and supplemented to the time of delivery of such letter authorizing reliance, and such Disclosure Package).
Subsequent Delivery of Legal Opinions
(c) . If so requested by such Agent, each time that the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented to include additional financial information, or there is filed with the SEC any document incorporated by reference into the Final Prospectus which contains additional financial information, or (if required pursuant to the terms of a Terms Agreement) the Company sells Notes to any Agent pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the Company shall cause KPMG LLP forthwith to furnish each Agent a letter, dated the date of effectiveness of such amendment, supplement or document with the SEC, or the date of such sale, as the case may be, in form satisfactory to the Agents, of the same general tenor as the letter referred to in Section 5(c) of this Agreement but modified to relate to the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus, as amended and supplemented to the date of such letter, and with such changes as may be necessary to reflect changes in the financial statements and other information derived from the accounting records of the Company; , that if the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus is amended or supplemented solely to include financial information as of and for a fiscal quarter, KPMG LLP may limit the scope of such letter to the unaudited financial statements included in such amendment or supplement.
Subsequent Delivery of Comfort Letters
provided, however
 
SECTION 8. .
Indemnification
(a) . The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Agent and each person, if any, who controls each Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arising out of or based upon the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party to the extent set forth below, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based on any such untrue statement or omission or such alleged untrue statement or omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Agents expressly for use therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
Indemnification of the Agents
provided, however,
(b) . Each Agent agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Agent, but only with reference to written information relating to such Agent furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Agent expressly for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity.
Indemnification of Company
(c) . In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing, and the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent it shall wish, jointly, with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party). Any failure to so notify shall not affect any rights that may exist other than pursuant to this Section 8. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts of interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any
General
 
indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one identified separate firm (in addition to any identified local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Agents that are indemnified parties in the case of parties to be indemnified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 8 and by the Company in the case of parties to be indemnified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 8. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its prior written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of the indemnified party.
SECTION 9. .
Contribution
(a) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 8 of this Agreement is for any reason held to be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless the indemnified parties although applicable in accordance with its terms, the indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the indemnified party, as incurred: (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and each Agent, on the other hand, from the offering of the Notes to which such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense shall relate; or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and each Agent, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and each Agent, on the other hand, in connection with such offering shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by each Agent in respect thereof. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and each Agent, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by such Agent and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. Each Agent's obligation to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 shall be several in the proportion that the principal amount of the Notes the sale of which by or through such Agent gave rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities bears to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes the sale of which by or through all Agents gave rise
 
to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, and not joint; , that no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section, each person, if any, who controls any Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Agent, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
provided, however
(b) The Company and the Agents agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to Section 9(a) of this Agreement were determined by allocation (even if the Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 9(a) of this Agreement. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 9(a) of this Agreement shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes referred to in Section 9(a) of this Agreement that were offered and sold by or through such Agent exceeds the amount of any damages that such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
pro rata

The provisions of the Distribution Agreement applicable to purchases of Notes by the Agents and the related definitions are incorporated by reference herein and shall be deemed to have the same force and effect as if set forth in full herein.
[For purposes of this Terms Agreement, the Agent(s) named herein as the Bookrunning Agent(s) shall have the sole right and authority on behalf of the other Agents named in the Schedule hereto to exercise any discretion, make any judgment or determinations of satisfaction, make any requests or make any other decision which the Agent(s) have the right to make pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, including without limitation, any decisions to terminate this Terms Agreement pursuant to Section 12 of the Distribution Agreement and any determinations as to whether the conditions set forth in Section 5 of the Distribution Agreement have been met as of the Settlement Date of the Notes.]

ANNEX A
These Administrative Procedures relate to the Notes defined in the Distribution Agreement, dated May 25, 2012 (the "Distribution Agreement"), among Wells Fargo & Company (the "Company") and the Agents named therein (together, the "Agents"), to which these Administrative Procedures are attached as Annex A. Defined terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings given such terms in the Distribution Agreement, the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented or the applicable Indenture. To the extent any procedure set forth below conflicts with the provisions of the Notes, the applicable Indenture, the Distribution Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement, the relevant provisions of the Notes, the applicable Indenture, the Distribution Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement shall control.
An Agent, in relation to a purchase of a Note by a purchaser solicited by such Agent, is referred to herein as the "Selling Agent" and, in relation to a purchase of a Note by such Agent as principal pursuant to a Terms Agreement, as the "Purchasing Agent". If agreed to by the Company and the applicable Selling Agent, such Selling Agent may utilize its best efforts on an agency basis to solicit offers to purchase the Notes.
Each Note will be issued only in fully registered form, without coupons, and will be represented by a global security (a "Global Security") delivered to the applicable Trustee, or the agent for such Trustee, as custodian for The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), and recorded in the book-entry system maintained by DTC (a "Book-Entry Security"). An owner of a Book-Entry Security will not be entitled to receive a certificate representing such a Note, except as provided in the applicable Indenture.
Book-Entry Securities which are payable in U.S. dollars will be issued in accordance with the Administrative Procedures set forth below as they may subsequently be amended as the result of changes in DTC's operating procedures. Global Securities which are payable in currencies other than in U.S. dollars will be issued in accordance with administrative procedures to be determined and agreed upon by the Company and the applicable Agents.
Certain duties of the Senior Trustee and the Subordinated Trustee hereunder may be performed by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Issuing, Paying & Authenticating Agent, and other duly appointed agents of the Senior Trustee or the Subordinated Trustee. The Calculation Agent will be Wells Fargo Bank, National Association.
In connection with the qualification of the Book-Entry Securities for eligibility in the book-entry system maintained by DTC, the Senior Trustee and the Subordinated Trustee will perform the custodial, document control and administrative functions described below, in accordance with its respective obligations as a participant in DTC, including DTC's Same-Day Funds Settlement System ("SDFS").
Issuance:
On any date of settlement (as defined under "Date of Settlement" below) for one or more Book-Entry Securities, the Company will issue a single Global Security representing the principal amount of all such Notes that have the same original issue date, stated maturity date and other terms (which Global Security shall represent no more than U.S. $500,000,000 of such principal amount if such Global Security is to be deposited with DTC or such other principal amount as may be permitted if such Global Security is to be deposited with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as agent for the applicable Trustee). Each Global Security will be dated and issued as of the date of its authentication by the applicable Trustee. Each Global Security will bear an "Interest Accrual Date," which will be (i) with respect to an original Global Security (or any portion thereof), its original issue date and (ii) with respect to any Global Security (or any portion thereof) issued subsequently upon exchange of a Global Security, or in lieu of a destroyed, lost or stolen Global Security, the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for on the predecessor Global Security (or if no such payment or provision has been made, the original issue date of the predecessor Global Security), regardless of the date of authentication of such subsequently issued Global Security.
Identification Numbers:
The Company has arranged with the CUSIP Service Bureau (the "CUSIP Service Bureau") of Standard & Poor's, a division of the McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P") for the reservation of CUSIP numbers assignable to the Global Security. The Company and DTC have obtained from the CUSIP Service Bureau a written list of such reserved CUSIP numbers. The Company will assign CUSIP numbers to Global Securities as described below under Settlement Procedure "B". DTC will notify the CUSIP Service Bureau periodically of the CUSIP numbers that the Company has assigned to Global Securities. When fewer than 100 of the reserved CUSIP numbers remain unassigned, the Company, if it deems necessary, will reserve additional CUSIP numbers for assignment to Global Securities. Upon obtaining such additional CUSIP numbers, the Company shall deliver a list of such additional CUSIP numbers to DTC.
Registration:
Unless otherwise specified by DTC, each Global Security will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC. The beneficial owner of an interest in a Global Security (or one or more indirect participants in DTC designated by such owner) will designate one or more participants in DTC (with respect to such Note, the "Participants") to act as agent or agents for such owner in connection with the book-entry system maintained by DTC, and DTC will record in book-entry form, in accordance with instructions provided by such Participants, a credit balance with respect to such beneficial owner in such Global Security in the account of such Participants. The ownership interest of such beneficial owner in such Global Security will be recorded through the records of such Participants or through the separate records of such Participants and one or more indirect participants in DTC.
 
Exchanges/Further Issues of the Same Series:
The Company may deliver to DTC, the CUSIP Issues of the Service Bureau and Interactive Data Corporation at any time a written notice of consolidation specifying (i) the CUSIP numbers of two or more Global Securities that represent Book-Entry Securities of the same series and for which interest has been paid to the same date, (ii) a date, occurring at least 30 days after such written notice is delivered and at least 30 days before the next Interest Payment Date for such Global Securities, on which such Global Securities shall be exchanged for a single replacement Global Security and (iii) a new CUSIP number to be assigned to such replacement Global Security. Upon receipt of such a notice, DTC will send to its participants (including the Company) a written reorganization notice to the effect that such exchange will occur on such date. Prior to the specified exchange date, the Company will deliver to the CUSIP Service Bureau a written notice setting forth such exchange date and the new CUSIP number and stating that, as of such exchange date, the CUSIP numbers of the Global Securities to be exchanged will no longer be valid. On the specified exchange date, the Company will exchange such Global Securities for a single Global Security bearing the new CUSIP number and the CUSIP numbers of the exchanged Global Securities will, in accordance with CUSIP Service Bureau procedures, be cancelled and not immediately reassigned. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Global Securities to be exchanged exceed US $500,000,000 (or the equivalent thereof in other currencies) in aggregate principal or face amount, as applicable, and are not held by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as agent for the applicable Trustee, or another entity as custodian of such Global Securities, one Global Security will be executed and issued to represent each US $500,000,000 (or the equivalent thereof in other currencies) of principal or face amount, as applicable, of the exchanged Global Securities and an additional Global Security will be executed and issued to represent any remaining principal or face amount of such exchanged Global Securities.
Denominations:
Book-Entry Securities will be issued in principal amounts of U.S. $1,000 or any amount in excess thereof that is an integral multiple of U.S. $1,000. Global Securities will be denominated in principal amounts not in excess of U.S. $500,000,000 if such Global Security is to be deposited with DTC or such other principal amount as may be permitted if such Global Security is to be deposited with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as agent for the applicable Trustee. If one or more Book-Entry Securities having an aggregate principal amount in excess of $500,000,000 would, but for the preceding sentence, be represented by a single Global Security and is to be deposited with the DTC, then one Global Security will be issued to represent each U.S. $500,000,000 principal amount of such Book-Entry Security or Securities and an additional Global Security will be issued to represent any remaining principal amount of such Book-Entry Security or Securities. In such a case, each of the Global Securities representing such Book-Entry Security or Securities shall be assigned the same CUSIP number.
Foreign Currency Payments:
If a series of Notes is denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, as set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Company may make payment of principal and any interest in the currency in which the Notes are denominated (the "Specified Currency"), as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, or will otherwise make such payments in U.S. dollars. DTC will elect to have all such payments of principal and interest in U.S. dollars unless notified by any of its Participants through which an interest in the Global Security is held that it
 
elects to receive such payment of principal or interest in the Specified Currency. On or prior to the third Business Day after the record date for payment of interest and twelve (12) days prior to the date for payment of principal, such Participant shall notify DTC of (i) its election to receive all or the specified portion of such payment in the Specified Currency and (ii) its instructions for wire transfer of such payment to an account in the Specified Currency.
DTC will notify the Company on or prior to the fifth Business Day after the record date for payment of interest and ten (10) days prior to the date for payment of principal of the portion of such payment to be received in the Specified Currency and the applicable wire transfer instructions, and the Company shall use such instructions to pay the Participants directly. If DTC does not so notify the Company, it is understood that only U.S. dollar payments are to be made. The Company, based on information provided by the Exchange Rate Agent, as defined in the applicable Pricing Supplement, if any, shall notify DTC on or prior to the second DTC business day prior to the payment date of the exchange rate to be used and the resulting U.S. dollar amount to be paid per US $1,000 principal amount. In the event that the Company's or such Exchange Rate Agent's quotation to convert the Specified Currency into U.S. dollars is not available, the Company shall notify DTC's Dividend Department that the entire payment is to be made in the Specified Currency. DTC then will ask its Participants for payment instructions and forward such instructions to the Company; and the Company shall use such instructions to pay the Participants directly.
The amount of any taxes required under applicable law to be withheld from any interest payment on a Global Security will be determined and withheld by the Participant, indirect participant in DTC or other person responsible for forwarding payments and materials directly to the beneficial owner of an interest in such Global Security.
Posting Rates by the Company:
The Company and the Agents will discuss, from time to time, the rates of interest per annum to be borne by, and the maturity of, Book-Entry Securities that may be sold as a result of the solicitation of offers by an Agent. The Company may establish a fixed set of interest rates and maturities for an offering period (a "Posting"). If the Company decides to change already posted rates, it will promptly advise the Agents to suspend solicitation of offers until the new posted rates have been established with the Agents.
Suspension of Solicitation:
The Company may instruct the Agents to suspend solicitation of offers to purchase Notes at any time. Upon receipt of such instructions, the Agents will forthwith suspend solicitation of offers to purchase Notes until such time as the Company has advised them that solicitation of offers to purchase may be resumed. In the event that, at the time the solicitation of offers to purchase from the Company is suspended (other than to change the interest rate or other variable terms of Notes), there shall be any offers to purchase Notes accepted by the Company that have not been settled, the Company will promptly advise the Agents whether such settlement may occur and whether copies of the Final Prospectus as theretofore amended or supplemented, or both, as in effect at the time of the suspension may be delivered in connection with the settlement of such accepted offers.
 
Acceptance of Offers by the Company:
Each Agent will promptly advise the Company by telephone or other appropriate means of all reasonable offers to purchase Book-Entry Securities, other than those rejected by such Agent. Each Agent may, in its discretion reasonably exercised, reject any offer received by it in whole or in part. Each Agent also may make offers to the Company to purchase Book-Entry Securities as a Purchasing Agent. The Company will have the sole right to accept offers to purchase Book-Entry Securities and may reject any such offer in whole or in part.
The Company will promptly notify the Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, of its acceptance or rejection of an offer to purchase Book-Entry Securities. If the Company accepts an offer to purchase Book-Entry Securities, it will confirm such acceptance in writing to the Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, and the applicable Trustee.
Communication of Sale Information to the Company by Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent and Settlement Procedures:
A. After the acceptance of an offer by the Company, the Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, will communicate promptly, but in no event later than the time set forth under "Settlement Procedure Timetable" below, the following details of the terms of such offer (the "Sale Information") to the Company by telephone (confirmed in writing) or by facsimile transmission or other acceptable written means:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
B. After receiving the Sale Information from the Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, the Company will communicate such Sale Information to the applicable
 
Trustee by facsimile transmission or other acceptable written means. The applicable Trustee or the Company, as the case may be, will assign a CUSIP number to the Global Security from a list of CUSIP numbers previously delivered to the applicable Trustee by the Company representing such Book-Entry Security and then advise the Company and the Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, of such CUSIP number as soon as practicable.
C. The applicable Trustee will enter a pending deposit message through DTC's Participant Terminal System, providing the following settlement information to DTC, and DTC shall forward such information to such Agent and Standard & Poor's Corporation:

G. The applicable Trustee will enter an SDFS deliver order through DTC's Participant Terminal System instructing DTC to (i) debit such Book-Entry Security to the applicable Trustee's participant account and credit such Book-Entry Security to such Agent's participant account at DTC, and (ii) debit such Agent's settlement account and credit the applicable Trustee's settlement account for an amount equal to the price of such Book-Entry Security less such Agent's commission. The entry of such a deliver order shall constitute a representation and warranty by the applicable Trustee to DTC that (a) the Global Security representing such Book-Entry Security has been issued and authenticated and (b) the applicable Trustee is holding such Global Security pursuant to the applicable Blanket Letter of Representations.
H. Unless the relevant Agent is the end purchaser of such security, such Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, will enter an SDFS deliver order through DTC's Participant Terminal System instructing DTC (i) to debit such Book-Entry Security to such

Preparation of Pricing Supplement by Company:
If the Company accepts an offer to purchase a Book-Entry Security, it will prepare a Pricing Supplement reflecting the terms of such Book-Entry Security and arrange to have delivered to the Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, such number of such Pricing Supplements as the Agent may reasonably request, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the Trade Date (as defined below). The Company will arrange to file a copy of the Pricing Supplement with the SEC not later than the close of business of the SEC on the second Business Day following the date on which such Pricing Supplement is first used.
In each instance that a Pricing Supplement is prepared, the relevant Agent will provide a copy of such Pricing Supplement to each investor or purchaser of the relevant Book-Entry Security or its agent. Outdated Pricing Supplements (other than those retained for files) will be destroyed.
Delivery of Confirmation and Prospectus to Purchaser by Selling Agent:
The Selling Agent will deliver to the purchaser of a Book-Entry Security a written confirmation of the sale and delivery and payment instructions. In addition, the Selling Agent
 
will deliver to such purchaser or its agent the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented (including the Pricing Supplement), in relation to such Book-Entry Security prior to, or together with, the delivery to such purchaser or its agent of the confirmation of sale.
Date of Settlement:
The receipt by the Company of immediately available funds in payment for a Book-Entry Security and the authentication and issuance of the Global Security representing such Book-Entry Security shall constitute "settlement" with respect to such Book-Entry Security. All orders of Book-Entry Securities solicited by a Selling Agent or made by a Purchasing Agent and accepted by the Company on a particular date (the "Trade Date") will be settled on a date (the "Settlement Date") which is on or before the fifth Business Day after the Trade Date pursuant to the "Settlement Procedure Timetable" set forth below, unless the Company and the purchaser agree to settlement on another day, which shall be no earlier than the next Business Day after the Trade Date.
Settlement Procedure Timetable:
For offers to purchase Book-Entry Securities solicited by a Selling Agent or made by a Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, and accepted by the Company for settlement on the first Business Day after the Trade Date, Settlement Procedures "A" through "K" set forth above shall be completed as soon as possible, but not later than the respective times (New York City time) set forth below:
 
If a sale is to be settled more than one Business Day after the Trade Date, Settlement Procedure "A" shall be completed as soon as practicable, but in no event later that 11:00 a.m. on the first Business Day after the Trade Date and Settlement Procedures "B" and "C" shall be completed as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 12:00 noon and 2:00 p.m., as the case may be, two Business Days before the Settlement Date. If the initial interest rate for a floating rate Book-Entry Security has not been determined at the time that Settlement Procedure "A" is
 
completed and the Settlement Date is at least three Business Days after the Trade Date, Settlement Procedures "B" and "C" shall be completed as soon as such rate has been determined but no later than 12:00 noon and 2:00 p.m., respectively, on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Settlement Date. Settlement Procedure "I" is subject to extension in accordance with any extension of Fedwire closing deadlines and in the other events specified in the SDFS operating procedures in effect on the Settlement Date.
If settlement of a Book-Entry Security is rescheduled or cancelled, the applicable Trustee, upon obtaining knowledge thereof, will deliver to DTC, through DTC's Participant Terminal System, a cancellation message to such effect by no later than 2:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately preceding the scheduled Settlement Date.
Failure to Settle:
If the applicable Trustee fails to enter an SDFS deliver order with respect to a Book-Entry Security pursuant to Settlement Procedure "G", the applicable Trustee may deliver to DTC, through DTC's Participant Terminal System, as soon as practicable a withdrawal message instructing DTC to debit such Book-Entry Security to the applicable Trustee's participant account, provided that the applicable Trustee's participant account contains a principal amount of the Global Security representing such Book-Entry Security that is at least equal to the principal amount to be debited. If a withdrawal message is processed with respect to all the Book-Entry Securities represented by a Global Security, the applicable Trustee will mark such Global Security "cancelled," make appropriate entries in the applicable Trustee's records and send such cancelled Global Security to the Company. The CUSIP number assigned to such Global Security shall, in accordance with the procedures of the CUSIP Service Bureau of Standard & Poor's Corporation, be cancelled and not immediately reassigned. If a withdrawal message is processed with respect to one or more, but not all, of the Book-Entry Securities represented by a Global Security, the applicable Trustee will exchange such Global Security for two Global Securities, one of which shall represent such Book-Entry Security or Securities and shall be cancelled immediately after issuance and the other of which shall represent the remaining Book-Entry Securities previously represented by the surrendered Global Security and shall bear the CUSIP number of the surrendered Global Security.
If the purchase price for any Book-Entry Security is not timely paid to the participants with respect to such Book-Entry Security by the beneficial purchaser thereof (or a person, including an indirect participant in DTC, acting on behalf of such purchaser), such participants and, in turn, the Agent for such Book-Entry Security, may enter delivery orders through DTC's Participant Terminal System debiting such Book-Entry Security to such participant's account and crediting such Book-Entry Security to such Agent's account and then debiting such Book-Entry Security to such Agent's participant account and crediting such Book-Entry Security to the applicable Trustee's participant account and shall notify the Company and the applicable Trustee thereof. Thereafter, the applicable Trustee will (i) immediately notify the Company of such order and the Company shall transfer to such Agent funds available for immediate use in an amount equal to the price of such Book-Entry Security which was credited to the account of the Company maintained at the applicable Trustee in accordance with Settlement Procedure "J", and (ii) deliver the withdrawal message and take the related actions described in the preceding paragraph. If such failure shall have occurred for any reason other than default by the applicable
 
Agent to perform its obligations hereunder or under the Distribution Agreement, the Company will reimburse such Agent on an equitable basis for the loss of its use of funds during the period when the funds were credited to the account of the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon any failure to settle with respect to a Book-Entry Security, DTC may take any actions in accordance with its SDFS operating procedures then in effect. In the event of a failure to settle with respect to one or more, but not all, of the Book-Entry Securities to have been represented by a Global Security, the applicable Trustee will provide, in accordance with Settlement Procedures "D", "E" and "G", for the authentication and issuance of a Global Security representing the other Book-Entry Securities to have been represented by such Global Security and will make appropriate entries in its records. The Company will, from time to time, furnish the applicable Trustee with a sufficient quantity of Global Securities representing the outstanding Book-Entry Securities.

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION
This is one of the Securities of the
series designated therein referred to
in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
General
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture dated as of July 21, 1999, as amended or supplemented from time to time (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Citibank, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series of the Securities designated as Medium-Term Notes, Series L, of the Company, which series is limited to an aggregate principal amount of $25,000,000,000 or the equivalent thereof in one or more foreign or composite currencies minus the aggregate principal amount of the Company's Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series M which may be issued from time to time. The Securities of this series may mature at different times, bear interest, if any, at different rates, be redeemable at different times or not at all, be repayable at the option of the Holder at different times or not at all, be issued at an original issue discount and be denominated in different currencies.
Article 16 of the Indenture shall not apply to the Securities.
The Securities are issuable only in registered form without coupons and will be book-entry securities represented by one or more global securities recorded in the book-entry system maintained by the Depositary ("Global Securities").
Events of Default
If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
Modification and Waivers
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the
 
Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected, acting together as a class. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding affected by certain provisions of the Indenture, acting together as a class, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with those provisions of the Indenture. Certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences may be waived under the Indenture by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (a) the entire indebtedness on this Security and (b) certain restrictive covenants and certain Events of Default, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Security.
Redemption
If so provided on the face hereof, the Company may at its option redeem this Security in whole or in part in increments of $1,000 or the equivalent amount in a foreign or composite currency (provided that any remaining principal amount of this Security shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination hereof) on or after the date or dates designated as the Redemption Date(s) on the face hereof at 100% of the unpaid principal amount hereof or the portion thereof redeemed, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date or, if a Redemption Price other than 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed is specified on the face hereof, the Redemption Price specified in the Addendum attached hereto. The Company may exercise such option by mailing a notice of such redemption to each Holder of the Securities of this series to be redeemed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the applicable Redemption Date. In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, the Company shall issue a new Security or Securities for the unredeemed portion hereof in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. If less than all of the Securities of this series with like tenor and terms are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and may provide for the selection for redemption of a portion of the principal amount of the Securities of this series held by a Holder equal to an authorized denomination. If this Security is a Global Security and if less than all of the Securities of this series are to be redeemed, the redemption shall be made in accordance with the Depositary's customary procedures. Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the applicable Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on this Security or portion hereof called for redemption.
 
Sinking Fund
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, this Security will not be entitled to any sinking fund.
Repayment
If so provided on the face hereof, this Security will be repayable prior to the Stated Maturity Date at the option of the Holder, in whole or in part and in increments of $1,000 or the equivalent amount in a foreign or composite currency (provided that any remaining principal amount of this Security surrendered for partial repayment shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination hereof), on or after the date designated as an Optional Repayment Date on the face hereof at 100% of the principal amount to be repaid, plus accrued interest, if any, to the Repayment Date or, if a Repayment Price other than 100% of the principal amount to be repaid is specified on the face hereof, at the Repayment Price specified in the Addendum attached hereto. In order for this Security to be repaid, the Paying Agent must receive at least 30 days but not more than 45 days prior to the Optional Repayment Date (i) this Security with the form entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" on the reverse of this Security duly completed, or (ii) a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or a letter from a member of a national securities exchange, or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States setting forth: (a) the name of the Holder of this Security; (b) the principal amount of this Security; (c) the principal amount of this Security to be repaid; (d) the certificate number or a description of the tenor and terms of this Security; (e) a statement that the option to elect repayment is being exercised; and (f) a guarantee that this Security, together with the duly completed form entitled "Option to Elect Repayment," will be received by the Paying Agent not later than the fifth Business Day after the date of the telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter. However, the telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter will only be effective if this Security and form duly completed are received by the Paying Agent by the fifth Business Day after the date of that telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter.
Any repayment option exercised by the Holder of this Security shall be irrevocable. The repayment option may be exercised for less than the entire principal amount of this Security, but in that event the principal amount of this Security remaining outstanding after repayment must be equal to $1,000 (or the equivalent amount in a foreign or composite currency) and integral multiples in excess thereof. Upon any partial repayment, this Security shall be cancelled and a new Security or Securities for the remaining principal amount hereof shall be issued in the name of the Holder of this Security. Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Repayment Price, on and after the applicable Repayment Date interest will cease to accrue on this Security or portion hereof requested to be repaid.
Authorized Denominations
Unless otherwise provided on the face hereof, this Security is issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 (or the equivalent amount in a foreign or composite currency) and integral multiples of $1,000 (or the equivalent amount in a foreign or composite currency) in excess thereof and cannot be exchanged for debt securities of the Company
 
in smaller denominations. Beneficial interests in this Security will only be held in denominations of $1,000 (or the equivalent amount in a foreign or composite currency) and integral multiples of $1,000 (or the equivalent amount in a foreign or composite currency) in excess thereof.
Registration of Transfer
Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Security at the office or agency of the Company in the City of Minneapolis, Minnesota, a new Security or Securities of this series in authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange herefor, as provided in the Indenture and subject to the limitations provided therein and to the limitations described below, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
If this Security is a Global Security (as specified above), this Security is exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form only if (x) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Security or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and a qualified successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, (y) the Company in its sole discretion determines that this Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form or elects to terminate the book-entry system through the Depositary and notifies the Trustee thereof or (z) an Event of Default with respect to the Securities represented hereby has occurred and is continuing. If this Security is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form, bearing interest at the same rate, having the same date of issuance, redemption provisions, Stated Maturity Date and other terms and of authorized denominations aggregating a like amount.
If this Security is a Global Security (as specified above), this Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor of the Depositary or a nominee of such successor. Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this Global Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form and will not be considered the Holders hereof for any purpose under the Indenture.
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Obligation of the Company Absolute

No Personal Recourse
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION
This is one of the Securities of the
series designated therein referred to
in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
OR
 
 
General
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture dated as of July 21, 1999, as amended or supplemented from time to time (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Citibank, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series of the Securities designated as Medium-Term Notes, Series L, of the Company, which series is limited to an aggregate principal amount of $25,000,000,000 or the equivalent thereof in one or more foreign or composite currencies minus the aggregate principal amount of the Company's Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series M which may be issued from time to time. The Securities of this series may mature at different times, bear interest, if any, at different rates, be redeemable at different times or not at all, be repayable at the option of the Holder at different times or not at all, be issued at an original issue discount and be denominated in different currencies.
Article 16 of the Indenture shall not apply to the Securities.
The Securities are issuable only in registered form without coupons and will be book-entry securities represented by one or more global securities recorded in the book-entry system maintained by the Depositary ("Global Securities").
Interest Rate Reset
The interest rate in effect from the Original Issue Date to the Initial Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof shall be the Initial Interest Rate specified on the face hereof. Commencing with the Initial Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof following the Original Issue Date specified on the face hereof, the interest rate on this Security will be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually as specified on the face hereof under "Interest Reset Period." Each such adjusted rate shall be applicable from and including the Interest Reset Date to which it relates to but not including the next succeeding Interest Reset Date or until Maturity, as the case may be. On each Interest Reset Date, the rate of interest on this Security shall be the rate determined with respect to the Interest Determination Date next preceding such Interest Reset Date in accordance with the provisions of the applicable heading below and adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified on the face hereof, and/or by the multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof.
 
If any Interest Reset Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the following Business Day, except that if the Base Rate specified above is LIBOR or EURIBOR and if such following Business Day is in the next calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
The amount of interest to be paid on this Security for each Interest Period will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of this Security by an accrued interest factor. The "accrued interest factor" will be computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day in the Interest Period. The "interest factor" for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to that day:
 
 
 
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, all percentages resulting from any calculation referred to herein shall be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with .000005% rounded up to .00001% and all U.S. dollar amounts used in or resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest cent, with one-half cent rounded upward. If the Japanese Yen is the Index Currency, all Japanese Yen amounts used in or resulting from these calculations will be rounded downward to the next lower Japanese Yen amount. All amounts denominated in any other currency used in or resulting from these calculations will be rounded to the nearest two decimal places in that currency, with .005 round up to .01.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate per annum hereon shall not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, specified on the face hereof. The Calculation Agent shall calculate the interest rate hereon in accordance with the foregoing on or before each Calculation Date.
The interest rate on this Security shall in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law, as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.
At the request of the Holder hereof, the Calculation Agent shall provide to the Holder hereof the interest rate hereon then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate that will become effective on the next Interest Reset Date with respect to this Security. The Calculation Agent's determination of any interest rate shall be final and binding in the absence of manifest error. The Calculation Agent shall notify the Paying Agent of each determination of the interest applicable to this Security promptly after the determination is made.

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION
This is one of the Securities of the
series designated therein referred to
in the within-mentioned Indenture.
THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON TRUST COMPANY,
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION
as Trustee
 
 
General
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture dated as of August 30, 1999, as amended or supplemented from time to time (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association (successor in interest to The First National Bank of Chicago), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series of the Securities designated as Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series M, of the Company, which series is limited to an aggregate principal amount of $25,000,000,000 or the equivalent thereof in one or more foreign or composite currencies minus the aggregate principal amount of the Company's Medium-Term Notes, Series L which may be issued from time to time. The Securities of this series may mature at different times, bear interest, if any, at different rates, be redeemable at different times or not at all, be repayable at the option of the Holder at different times or not at all, be issued at an original issue discount and be denominated in different currencies.
The Securities are issuable only in registered form without coupons and will be book-entry securities represented by one or more global securities recorded in the book-entry system maintained by the Depositary ("Global Securities").
The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture, subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on all Senior Debt of the Company, and the Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, agrees to and shall be bound by the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto.
Events of Default
If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
Modification and Waivers
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected, acting together as a class. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding affected by certain provisions of the Indenture, acting together as a class, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with those provisions of the Indenture. Certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences may be waived under the Indenture by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (a) the entire indebtedness on this Security and (b) certain restrictive covenants and certain Events of Default, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Security.
Redemption
If so provided on the face hereof, the Company may at its option redeem this Security in whole or in part in increments of $1,000 or the equivalent amount in a foreign or composite currency (provided that any remaining principal amount of this Security shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination hereof) on or after the date or dates designated as the Redemption Date(s) on the face hereof at 100% of the unpaid principal amount hereof or the portion thereof redeemed, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date or, if a Redemption Price other than 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed is specified on the face hereof, the Redemption Price specified in the Addendum attached hereto. The Company may exercise such option by mailing a notice of such redemption to each Holder of the Securities of this series to be redeemed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the applicable Redemption Date. In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, the Company shall issue a new Security or Securities for the unredeemed portion hereof in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. If less than all of the Securities of this series with like tenor and terms are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and may provide for the selection for redemption of a portion of the principal amount of the Securities of this series held by a Holder equal to an authorized denomination. If this Security is a Global Security and if less than all of the Securities of this series are to be redeemed, the redemption shall be made in accordance with the Depositary's customary procedures. Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the applicable Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on this Security or portion hereof called for redemption.
 
Sinking Fund
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, this Security will not be entitled to any sinking fund.
Repayment
If so provided on the face hereof, this Security will be repayable prior to the Stated Maturity Date at the option of the Holder, in whole or in part and in increments of $1,000 or the equivalent amount in a foreign or composite currency (provided that any remaining principal amount of this Security surrendered for partial repayment shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination hereof), on or after the date designated as an Optional Repayment Date on the face hereof at 100% of the principal amount to be repaid, plus accrued interest, if any, to the Repayment Date or, if a Repayment Price other than 100% of the principal amount to be repaid is specified on the face hereof, at the Repayment Price specified in the Addendum attached hereto. In order for this Security to be repaid, the Paying Agent must receive at least 30 days but not more than 45 days prior to the Optional Repayment Date (i) this Security with the form entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" on the reverse of this Security duly completed, or (ii) a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or a letter from a member of a national securities exchange, or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States setting forth: (a) the name of the Holder of this Security; (b) the principal amount of this Security; (c) the principal amount of this Security to be repaid; (d) the certificate number or a description of the tenor and terms of this Security; (e) a statement that the option to elect repayment is being exercised; and (f) a guarantee that this Security, together with the duly completed form entitled "Option to Elect Repayment," will be received by the Paying Agent not later than the fifth Business Day after the date of the telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter. However, the telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter will only be effective if this Security and form duly completed are received by the Paying Agent by the fifth Business Day after the date of that telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter.
Any repayment option exercised by the Holder of this Security shall be irrevocable. The repayment option may be exercised for less than the entire principal amount of this Security, but in that event the principal amount of this Security remaining outstanding after repayment must be equal to $1,000 (or the equivalent amount in a foreign or composite currency) and integral multiples in excess thereof. Upon any partial repayment, this Security shall be cancelled and a new Security or Securities for the remaining principal amount hereof shall be issued in the name of the Holder of this Security. Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Repayment Price, on and after the applicable Repayment Date interest will cease to accrue on this Security or portion hereof requested to be repaid.

Unless otherwise provided on the face hereof, this Security is issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 (or the equivalent amount in a foreign or composite currency) and integral multiples of $1,000 (or the equivalent amount in a foreign or composite currency) in excess thereof and cannot be exchanged for debt securities of the Company in smaller denominations. Beneficial interests in this Security will only be held in denominations of $1,000 (or the equivalent amount in a foreign or composite currency) and integral multiples of $1,000 (or the equivalent amount in a foreign or composite currency) in excess thereof.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON TRUST COMPANY,
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION

OR
WELLS FARGO BANK, N.A.,
as Authenticating Agent for the Trustee
 
 
General
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture dated as of August 30, 1999, as amended or supplemented from time to time (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association (successor in interest to The First National Bank of Chicago), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series of the Securities designated as Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series M, of the Company, which series is limited to an aggregate principal amount of $25,000,000,000 or the equivalent thereof in one or more foreign or composite currencies minus the aggregate principal amount of the Company's Medium-Term Notes, Series L which may be issued from time to time. The Securities of this series may mature at different times, bear interest, if any, at different rates, be redeemable at different times or not at all, be repayable at the option of the Holder at different times or not at all, be issued at an original issue discount and be denominated in different currencies.
The Securities are issuable only in registered form without coupons and will be book-entry securities represented by one or more global securities recorded in the book-entry system maintained by the Depositary ("Global Securities").
The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture, subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on all Senior Debt of the Company, and the Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, agrees to and shall be bound by the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto.
Interest Rate Reset
The interest rate in effect from the Original Issue Date to the Initial Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof shall be the Initial Interest Rate specified on the face hereof. Commencing with the Initial Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof following the Original Issue Date specified on the face hereof, the interest rate on this Security will be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually as specified on the face hereof under "Interest Reset Period." Each such adjusted rate shall be applicable from and including the Interest Reset Date to
 
which it relates to but not including the next succeeding Interest Reset Date or until Maturity, as the case may be. On each Interest Reset Date, the rate of interest on this Security shall be the rate determined with respect to the Interest Determination Date next preceding such Interest Reset Date in accordance with the provisions of the applicable heading below and adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified on the face hereof, and/or by the multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof.
If any Interest Reset Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the following Business Day, except that if the Base Rate specified above is LIBOR or EURIBOR and if such following Business Day is in the next calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
The amount of interest to be paid on this Security for each Interest Period will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of this Security by an accrued interest factor. The "accrued interest factor" will be computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day in the Interest Period. The "interest factor" for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to that day:
 
 
 
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, all percentages resulting from any calculation referred to herein shall be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with .000005% rounded up to .00001% and all U.S. dollar amounts used in or resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest cent, with one-half cent rounded upward. If the Japanese Yen is the Index Currency, all Japanese Yen amounts used in or resulting from these calculations will be rounded downward to the next lower Japanese Yen amount. All amounts denominated in any other currency used in or resulting from these calculations will be rounded to the nearest two decimal places in that currency, with .005 round up to .01.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate per annum hereon shall not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, specified on the face hereof. The Calculation Agent shall calculate the interest rate hereon in accordance with the foregoing on or before each Calculation Date.
The interest rate on this Security shall in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law, as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.
 
At the request of the Holder hereof, the Calculation Agent shall provide to the Holder hereof the interest rate hereon then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate that will become effective on the next Interest Reset Date with respect to this Security. The Calculation Agent's determination of any interest rate shall be final and binding in the absence of manifest error.
