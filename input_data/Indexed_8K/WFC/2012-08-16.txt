Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
      as Representative of the several Underwriters named in Schedule I
c/o Wells Fargo Securities, LLC

Charlotte, North Carolina 28288
Attn: Transaction Management Department
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Wells Fargo & Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell to the several underwriters named in Schedule I hereto (the "Underwriters"), for whom you are acting as representative (the "Representative"), an aggregate of 27,000,000 Depositary Shares (the "Firm Shares"), each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of the Company's Non-Cumulative Perpetual Class A Preferred Stock, Series N, no par value, with a liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per depositary share) (the "Preferred Stock") and, at the election of the Underwriters, up to an additional 3,000,000 Depositary Shares (the "Option Shares"). The Firm Shares and the Option Shares are herein collectively referred to as the "Shares." The Preferred Stock, when issued, will be deposited by the Company with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as depositary, transfer agent and registrar (the "Depositary") under a deposit agreement, to be dated August 16, 2012 (the "Deposit Agreement"), among the Company, the Depositary and the holders from time to time of the Depositary Receipts issued thereunder against delivery to, or upon the order of, the Company of depositary receipts (the "Depositary Receipts"), which will evidence the Shares. For purposes of this Agreement, "Depositary Shares" means the depositary shares, each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of the Company's Non-Cumulative Perpetual Class A Preferred Stock, Series N, no par value, with a liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per depositary share).
The Company meets the requirements for use of Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-180989) as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act for the registration of securities, including the Shares, under the Securities Act, and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the SEC under the Securities Act (the "Securities Act Regulations"). No notice of objection of the SEC to the use of such registration
statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act has been received by the Company. Such registration statement, including any amendments thereto, became effective upon filing and no order suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement has been issued by the SEC and no proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act against the Company or related to the offering has been initiated or threatened by the SEC. The Company proposes to file with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act a supplement to a form of prospectus included in such registration statement relating to the Shares in the form heretofore delivered to you. Such registration statement, including all exhibits thereto, as amended at the date of this Agreement, and including any prospectus supplement relating to the Shares that is filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act and deemed part of such registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act, is hereinafter called the "Registration Statement"; such prospectus in the form in which it appears in the Registration Statement is hereinafter called the "Basic Prospectus" and such supplemented form of prospectus, in the form in which it shall be filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) (including the Basic Prospectus as so supplemented) is hereinafter called the "Final Prospectus." Any preliminary form of the Final Prospectus which has been or will be filed pursuant to Rule 424 is hereinafter called the "Preliminary Final Prospectus." The term "Free Writing Prospectus" shall mean a free writing prospectus, as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act. The term "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus" shall mean an issuer free writing prospectus, as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act, that (i) is required to be filed with the SEC by the Company or (ii) is exempt from filing pursuant to Rule 433(d)(5)(i) because it contains a description of the Shares or the offering that does not reflect the final terms. The term "Applicable Time" shall mean the Applicable Time listed in Schedule II hereto. The term "Disclosure Package" shall mean (A) the Basic Prospectus, as amended and supplemented to the Applicable Time, (B) any Preliminary Final Prospectus, (C) the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses and any other information identified in Schedule III hereto, and (D) any other Free Writing Prospectus that the parties hereto shall hereafter expressly agree in writing to treat as part of the Disclosure Package. Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents filed by the Company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and incorporated therein as of the date of this Agreement, or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or the relevant Applicable Time, as the case may be. Any reference herein to the terms "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the date of this Agreement, or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be, and deemed to be incorporated therein by reference.

If any Option Shares are to be purchased, the number of Option Shares to be purchased by each Underwriter shall be the number of Option Shares which bears the same ratio to the aggregate number of Option Shares being purchased as the number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto (or such number increased as set forth in Section 8 hereof) bears to the aggregate number of Firm Shares being purchased from the Company by the several Underwriters, subject, however, to such adjustments to eliminate any fractional Shares as the Representative in their sole discretion shall make.

Any such notice shall be given at least five business days prior to the date and time of delivery specified therein.

Delivery of the Shares to be purchased on the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, shall be made to the Representative for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters, with any transfer taxes payable in connection with the sale of such Shares duly paid by the Company, against payment by the several Underwriters through the Representative of the purchase price thereof in the manner set forth in Schedule II hereto.

(M) The Registration Statement is effective under the Securities Act and, to the knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as amended, or any notice under Rule 401(g)(2) that would prevent its use, has been issued under the Securities Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been initiated or, to the knowledge of such counsel, threatened by the SEC; and any required filing of the Final Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act.

(R) Such counsel has no reason to believe that (i) the Registration Statement, at the time it became effective (other than the financial statements and related notes and other financial and financial reserve information and statistical and accounting data contained therein and other than statements to the Company by or on behalf of an Underwriter through the Representative, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of the date hereof and as of the date the opinion is being rendered (other than the financial statements and related notes and other financial and financial reserve information and statistical and accounting data contained therein and other than statements to the Company by or on behalf of an Underwriter through the Representative, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (iii) the Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time (other than the financial statements and related notes and other financial and financial reserve information and statistical and accounting data contained therein and other than statements to the Company by or on behalf of an Underwriter through the Representative, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Minnesota or the United States, to the extent deemed proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of counsel who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters, including special Delaware counsel to the Company with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby; and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and public officials.

Opinion of Counsel to the Underwriters
 
 
(i) since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Final Prospectus, there has not been any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business, properties or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus;

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary shall register on its books from time to time transfers of Receipts upon any surrender thereof by the holder in person or by duly authorized attorney, properly endorsed or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer. Thereupon, the Depositary shall execute a new Receipt or Receipts evidencing the same aggregate number of Depositary Shares as those evidenced by the Receipt or Receipts surrendered and deliver such new Receipt or Receipts to or upon the order of the person entitled thereto.
The Depositary shall not be required (a) to issue, transfer or exchange any Receipts for a period beginning at the opening of business fifteen days next preceding any selection of Depositary Shares and Series N Preferred Stock to be redeemed and ending at the close of business on the day of the mailing of notice of redemption, or (b) to transfer or exchange for another Receipt any Receipt called or being called for redemption in whole or in part except as provided in Section 2.8.

Upon surrender of a Receipt or Receipts at the Depositary's Office or at such other offices as it may designate for the purpose of effecting a split-up or combination of such Receipt or Receipts, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary shall execute a new Receipt or Receipts in the authorized denomination or denominations requested, evidencing the aggregate number of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipt or Receipts surrendered, and shall deliver such new Receipt or Receipts to or upon the order of the holder of the Receipt or Receipts so surrendered.
Any holder of a Receipt or Receipts may withdraw the number of whole shares of Series N Preferred Stock and all money and other property, if any, represented thereby by surrendering such Receipt or Receipts, at the Depositary's Office or at such other offices as the Depositary may designate for such withdrawals. Thereafter, without unreasonable delay, the Depositary shall deliver to such holder, or to the person or persons designated by such holder as hereinafter provided, the number of whole shares of Series N Preferred Stock and all money and other property, if any, represented by the Receipt or Receipts so surrendered for withdrawal, but holders of such whole shares of Series N Preferred Stock will not thereafter be entitled to deposit such Series N Preferred Stock hereunder or to receive a Receipt evidencing Depositary Shares therefor. If a Receipt delivered by the holder to the Depositary in connection with such withdrawal shall evidence a number of Depositary Shares in excess of the number of Depositary Shares representing the number of whole shares of Series N Preferred Stock to be so withdrawn, the Depositary shall at the same time, in addition to such number of whole shares of Series N Preferred Stock and such money and other property, if any, to be so withdrawn, deliver to such holder, or subject to Section 2.3 upon such holder's order, a new Receipt evidencing such excess number of Depositary Shares.
 
In no event will fractional shares of Series N Preferred Stock (or any cash payment in lieu thereof) be delivered by the Depositary. Delivery of the Series N Preferred Stock and money and other property, if any, being withdrawn may be made by the delivery of such certificates, documents of title and other instruments as the Depositary may deem appropriate.
If the Series N Preferred Stock and the money and other property, if any, being withdrawn are to be delivered to a person or persons other than the record holder of the Receipt or Receipts being surrendered for withdrawal of Series N Preferred Stock, such holder shall execute and deliver to the Depositary a written order so directing the Depositary and the Depositary may require that the Receipt or Receipts surrendered by such holder for withdrawal of such shares of Series N Preferred Stock be properly endorsed in blank or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer in blank.
Delivery of the Series N Preferred Stock and the money and other property, if any, represented by Receipts surrendered for withdrawal shall be made by the Depositary at the Depositary's Office, except that, at the request, risk and expense of the holder surrendering such Receipt or Receipts and for the account of the holder thereof, such delivery may be made at such other place as may be designated by such holder.
 
As a condition precedent to the execution and delivery, registration of transfer, split-up, combination, surrender or exchange of any Receipt, the Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents or the Company may require payment to it of a sum sufficient for the payment (or, in the event that the Depositary or the Company shall have made such payment, the reimbursement to it) of any charges or expenses payable by the holder of a Receipt pursuant to Section 5.7, may require the production of evidence satisfactory to it as to the identity and genuineness of any signature and may also require compliance with such regulations, if any, as the Depositary or the Company may establish consistent with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement and/or applicable law.
The deposit of Series N Preferred Stock may be refused, the delivery of Receipts against Series N Preferred Stock may be suspended, the registration of transfer of Receipts may be refused and the registration of transfer, surrender or exchange of outstanding Receipts may be suspended (i) during any period when the register of stockholders of the Company is closed or (ii) if any such action is deemed necessary or advisable by the Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents or the Company at any time or from time to time because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body or commission or under any provision of this Deposit Agreement.
 
In case any Receipt shall be mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen, the Depositary in its discretion may execute and deliver a Receipt of like form and tenor in exchange and substitution for such mutilated Receipt, or in lieu of and in substitution for such destroyed, lost or stolen Receipt, upon (i) the filing by the holder thereof with the Depositary of evidence satisfactory to the Depositary of such destruction or loss or theft of such Receipt, of the authenticity thereof and of such holder's ownership thereof and (ii) the holder thereof furnishing of the Depositary with reasonable indemnification satisfactory to the Depositary.
 
All Receipts surrendered to the Depositary or any Depositary's Agent shall be cancelled by the Depositary. Except as prohibited by applicable law or regulation, the Depositary is authorized and directed to destroy all Receipts so cancelled.
 
Whenever the Company shall be permitted and shall elect to redeem shares of Series N Preferred Stock in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation (including on account of a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, as described therein), it shall (unless otherwise agreed to in writing with the Depositary) give or cause to be given to the Depositary, not less than 40 days and not more than 70 days prior to the Redemption Date (as defined below), notice of the date of such proposed redemption of Series N Preferred Stock and of the number of such shares held by the Depositary to be so redeemed and the applicable Depositary Share Redemption Price, which notice shall be accompanied by a certificate from the Company stating that such redemption of Series N Preferred Stock is in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation. On the date of such redemption, provided that the Company shall then have paid or caused to be paid in full to the Depositary the redemption price per share of Series N Preferred Stock to be redeemed, plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption, in accordance with and as required by the provisions of the Certificate of Designation (the ""), the Depositary shall redeem the number of Depositary Shares representing such Series N Preferred Stock.

Each such notice shall be prepared by the Company and shall state: (i) the Redemption Date; (ii) the number of Depositary Shares to be redeemed and, if less than all the Depositary Shares held by any such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such Depositary Shares held by such holder to be so redeemed; (iii) the Depositary Share Redemption Price (as defined below); and (iv) the place or places where Receipts evidencing Depositary Shares are to be surrendered for payment of the Depositary Share Redemption Price (as defined below). In case less than all the outstanding Depositary Shares are to be redeemed, the Depositary Shares to be so redeemed shall be selected by the Depositary (as nearly as may be) or in any other manner determined by the Depositary in its sole discretion to be fair and equitable. In any case, the Depositary will redeem Depositary Shares only in increments of 1,000 Depositary Shares and multiples thereof.

Notice having been mailed or transmitted by the Depositary as aforesaid, from and after the Redemption Date (unless the Company shall have failed to provide the funds necessary to redeem the Series N Preferred Stock evidenced by the Depositary Shares called for redemption) (i) all shares of Series N Preferred Stock called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding and any rights with respect to such shares shall cease and terminate (except for the right to receive the Preferred Stock Redemption Price without interest), (ii) the Depositary Shares being redeemed from such proceeds shall cease to be outstanding and all rights of the holders of Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares shall, to the extent of such Depositary Shares, cease and terminate (except the right to receive the Depositary Share Redemption Price without interest), and (iii) upon surrender in accordance with such redemption notice of the Receipts evidencing any such Depositary Shares called for redemption (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Depositary or applicable law shall so require), such Depositary Shares shall be redeemed by the Depositary at a redemption price per Depositary Share (the "") equal to 1/1,000
Depositary Share Redemption Price
th
of the Preferred Stock Redemption Price per share of Series N Preferred Stock so redeemed plus all money and other property, if any, represented by such Depositary Shares.
If fewer than all of the Depositary Shares evidenced by a Receipt are called for redemption, the Depositary will deliver to the holder of such Receipt upon its surrender to the Depositary, together with the redemption payment, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares evidenced by such prior Receipt and not called for redemption.
 
If the Company shall determine in a writing delivered to the Depositary that the Receipts are to be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Registered Receipts, then the Depositary shall, in accordance with the other provisions of this Deposit Agreement, execute and deliver one or more Global Registered Receipts evidencing such Receipts, which (i) shall represent, and shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of, the Receipts to be represented by such Global Registered Receipt or Receipts, and (ii) shall be registered in the name of the Global Receipt Depository therefor or its nominee.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Deposit Agreement to the contrary, unless otherwise provided in the Global Registered Receipt, a Global Registered Receipt may only be transferred in whole and only by the applicable Global Receipt Depository for such Global Registered Receipt to a nominee of such Global Receipt Depository, or by a nominee of such Global Receipt Depository to such Global Receipt Depository or another nominee of such Global Receipt Depository, or by such Global Receipt Depository or any such nominee to a successor Global Receipt Depository for such Global Registered Receipt selected or approved by the Company or to a nominee of such successor Global Receipt Depository. Except as provided below, owners solely of beneficial interests in a Global Registered Receipt shall not be entitled to receive physical delivery of the Receipts represented by such Global Registered Receipt. Neither any such beneficial owner nor any direct or indirect participant of a Global Receipt Depository shall have any rights under this Deposit Agreement with respect to any Global Registered
 
Receipt held on their behalf by a Global Receipt Depository and such Global Receipt Depository may be treated by the Company, the Depositary and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or the Depositary as the holder of such Global Registered Receipt for all purposes whatsoever.
Unless and until definitive Receipts are delivered to the owners of the beneficial interests in a Global Registered Receipt, (1) the applicable Global Receipt Depository will make book-entry transfers among its participants and receive and transmit all payments and distributions in respect of the Global Registered Receipts to such participants, in each case, in accordance with its applicable procedures and arrangements, and (2) whenever any notice, payment or other communication to the holders of Global Registered Receipts is required under this Deposit Agreement, the Company and the Depositary shall give all such notices, payments and communications specified herein to be given to such holders to the applicable Global Receipt Depository.
If an Exchange Event has occurred with respect to any Global Registered Receipt, then, in any such event, the Depositary shall, upon receipt of a written order from the Company for the execution and delivery of individual definitive registered Receipts in exchange for such Global Registered Receipt, shall execute and deliver individual definitive registered Receipts, in authorized denominations and of like tenor and terms in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Registered Receipt surrendered in exchange for such Global Registered Receipt.
Definitive registered Receipts issued in exchange for a Global Registered Receipt pursuant to this Section shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Global Receipt Depository for such Global Registered Receipt, pursuant to instructions from its participants, shall instruct the Depositary in writing. The Depositary shall deliver such Receipts to the persons in whose names such Receipts are so registered.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Deposit Agreement, should the Company determine that the Receipts should be issued as a Global Registered Receipt, the parties hereto shall comply with the terms of each Letter of Representations.
 
Any holder of a Receipt may be required from time to time to file such proof of residence, or other matters or other information, to execute such certificates and to make such representations and warranties as the Depositary or the Company may reasonably deem necessary or proper. The Depositary or the Company may withhold the delivery, or delay the registration of transfer or redemption, of any Receipt or the withdrawal of the Series N Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by any Receipt or the distribution of any dividend or other distribution or the sale of any rights or of the proceeds thereof until such proof or other information is filed or such certificates are executed or such representations and warranties are made.
 
Holders of Receipts shall be obligated to make payments to the Depositary of certain charges and expenses, as provided in Section 5.7. Registration of transfer of any Receipt or any withdrawal of Series N Preferred Stock and all money or other property, if any, represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be refused until any such payment due is made, and any dividends or other distributions may be withheld or any part of or all the Series N Preferred Stock or other property represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt and not theretofore sold may be sold for the account of the holder thereof (after attempting by reasonable means to notify such holder prior to such sale), and such dividends or other distributions or the proceeds of any such sale may be applied to any payment of such charges or expenses, the holder of such Receipt remaining liable for any deficiency.
 
The Company hereby represents and warrants that the Series N Preferred Stock, when issued, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable (subject to 12 U.S.C.  55). Such representation and warranty shall survive the deposit of the Series N Preferred Stock and the issuance of Receipts.
 
The Company hereby represents and warrants that the Receipts, when issued, will represent legal and valid interests in the Series N Preferred Stock. Such representation and warranty shall survive the deposit of the Series N Preferred Stock and the issuance of Receipts.
 
Whenever the Depositary shall receive any cash dividend or other cash distribution on Series N Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.4 such amounts of such dividend or distribution as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders; provided, however, that in case the Company or the Depositary shall be required to withhold and shall withhold from any cash dividend or other cash distribution in respect of the Series N Preferred Stock an amount on account of taxes, the amount made available for distribution or distributed in respect of Depositary Shares shall be reduced accordingly. The Depositary shall distribute or make available for distribution, as the case may be, only such amount, however, as can be distributed without attributing to any holder of Depositary Shares a fraction of one cent. If the calculation of a cash distribution results in an amount that is a fraction of a cent and that fraction is equal to or greater than $0.005, the Depositary shall round that amount up to the next highest whole cent and
 
will request that Company pay the resulting additional amount to the Depositary for the relevant dividend or other cash distribution. If the fractional amount is less than $0.005, the Depositary shall disregard that fractional amount and any balance thus not distributable shall be held by the Depositary (without liability for interest thereon) and shall be added to and be treated as part of the next sum received by the Depositary for distribution to record holders of Receipts then outstanding. Each holder of a Receipt shall provide the Depositary with its certified tax identification number on a properly completed Form W-8 or W-9, as may be applicable. Each holder of a Receipt acknowledges that, in the event of non-compliance with the preceding sentence, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, may require withholding by the Depositary of a portion of any of the distributions to be made hereunder.
 
Whenever the Depositary shall receive any distribution other than cash, rights, preferences or privileges upon Series N Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall, at the direction of the Company, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.4 such amounts of the securities or property received by it as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders, in any manner that the Company may deem equitable and practicable for accomplishing such distribution. If in the opinion of the Depositary such distribution cannot be made proportionately among such record holders in accordance with the direction of the Company, or if for any other reason (including any requirement that the Company or the Depositary withhold an amount on account of taxes) the Depositary deems, after consultation with the Company, such distribution not to be feasible, the Depositary may, with the approval of the Company, adopt such method as it deems equitable and practicable for the purpose of effecting such distribution, including the sale (at public or private sale) of the securities or property thus received, or any part thereof, in a commercially reasonable manner. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, be distributed or made available for distribution, as the case may be, by the Depositary to record holders of Receipts as provided by Section 4.1 in the case of a distribution received in cash. The Company shall not make any distribution of such securities or property to the Depositary and the Depositary shall not make any distribution of such securities or property to the holders of Receipts unless the Company shall have provided an opinion of counsel stating that such securities or property have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered in connection with such distributions.
 
If the Company shall at any time offer or cause to be offered to the persons in whose names Series N Preferred Stock is recorded on the books of the Company any rights, preferences or privileges to subscribe for or to purchase any securities or any rights, preferences or privileges of any other nature, such rights, preferences or privileges shall in each such instance be made available by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts in such manner as the Company shall instruct the Depositary in writing, either by the issue to such record holders of warrants representing such rights, preferences or privileges or by such other method as may be approved by the Company; provided, however, that (i) if at the time of issue or offer of any such rights, preferences or privileges the Depositary determines that it is not lawful or (after consultation
 
with the Company) not feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available to holders of Receipts by the issue of warrants or otherwise, or (ii) if and to the extent so instructed by holders of Receipts who do not desire to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges, then the Depositary, in its discretion (with approval of the Company, in any case where the Depositary has determined that it is not feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available), may, if applicable laws or the terms of such rights, preferences or privileges permit such transfer, sell such rights, preferences or privileges at public or private sale, at such place or places and upon such terms as it may deem proper. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, be distributed by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts entitled thereto as provided by Section 4.1 in the case of a distribution received in cash.
The Company shall notify the Depositary whether registration under the Securities Act of the securities to which any rights, preferences or privileges relate is required in order for holders of Receipts to be offered or sold the securities to which such rights, preferences or privileges relate, and the Company agrees with the Depositary that it will file promptly a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act with respect to such rights, preferences or privileges and securities and use its reasonable best efforts and take all steps available to it to cause such registration statement to become effective sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges. In no event shall the Depositary make available to the holders of Receipts any right, preference or privilege to subscribe for or to purchase any securities unless and until such registration statement shall have become effective, or the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel to the effect that the offering and sale of such securities to such holders are exempt from registration under the provisions of the Securities Act.
The Company shall notify the Depositary whether any other action under the laws of any jurisdiction or any governmental or administrative authorization, consent or permit is required in order for such rights, preferences or privileges to be made available to holders of Receipts, and the Company agrees with the Depositary that the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to take such action or obtain such authorization, consent or permit sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges.
 
Whenever any cash dividend or other cash distribution shall become payable or any distribution other than cash shall be made, or if rights, preferences or privileges shall at any time be offered, with respect to Series N Preferred Stock, or whenever the Depositary shall receive notice of any meeting at which holders of Series N Preferred Stock are entitled to vote or of which holders of Series N Preferred Stock are entitled to notice, or whenever the Depositary and the Company shall decide it is appropriate, the Depositary shall in each such instance fix a record date (which shall be the same date as the record date fixed by the Company with respect to, or otherwise in accordance with the terms of, the Series N Preferred Stock, as identified in a written notice to the Depositary of such record date) for the determination of the holders of Receipts who shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution, rights, preferences or privileges or the net proceeds of the sale thereof, or to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at any such meeting, or who shall be entitled to notice of such meeting or for any other appropriate reasons.
 
Section 4.5.
Voting Rights.
Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Designation, upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of Series N Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the Depositary shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the record holders of Receipts a notice prepared by the Company which shall contain (i) such information as is contained in such notice of meeting and (ii) a statement that the holders may, subject to any applicable restrictions, instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of Series N Preferred Stock represented by their respective Depositary Shares (including an express indication that instructions may be given to the Depositary to give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by the Company) and a brief statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of the holders of Receipts on the relevant record date, the Depositary shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such requests, the maximum number of whole shares of Series N Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by all Receipts as to which any particular voting instructions are received. The Company hereby agrees to take all reasonable action which may be deemed necessary by the Depositary in order to enable the Depositary to vote such Series N Preferred Stock or cause such Series N Preferred Stock to be voted. In the absence of specific instructions from holders of Receipts, the Depositary will abstain from voting (but shall appear) at any meeting with respect to the Series N Preferred Stock (unless directed to the contrary by the record holders of all related Receipts) to the extent of the Depositary Shares (or portion thereof) represented by the applicable Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt.
Section 4.6.
Changes Affecting Deposited Securities and Reclassifications, Recapitalizations, etc.
Upon any change in par or stated value, split-up, combination or any other reclassification of the Series N Preferred Stock subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Designation, or upon any recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation affecting the Company or to which it is a party, the Depositary may in its discretion with the approval of, and shall upon the instructions of, the Company, and (in either case) in such manner as the Depositary may deem equitable, (i) make such adjustments as are certified by the Company in the fraction of an interest represented by one Depositary Share in one share of Series N Preferred Stock and in the ratio of the Depositary Share Redemption Price to the Preferred Stock Redemption Price, in each case as may be necessary fully to reflect the effects of such change in par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of Series N Preferred Stock, or of such recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation and (ii) treat any securities which shall be received by the Depositary in exchange for or upon conversion of or in respect of the Series N Preferred Stock as new deposited securities so received in exchange for or upon conversion or in respect of such Series N Preferred Stock. In any such case the Depositary may in its discretion, with the approval of the Company, execute and deliver additional Receipts or may call for the surrender of all outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts specifically describing such new deposited securities. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, holders of Receipts shall have the right from and after the effective date of any such change in par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of the Series N Preferred Stock or any such recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation to surrender
 
such Receipts to the Depositary with instructions to convert, exchange or surrender the Series N Preferred Stock represented thereby only into or for, as the case may be, the kind and amount of shares of Series N Preferred Stock and other securities and property and cash into which the Series N Preferred Stock represented by such Receipts might have been converted or for which such Series N Preferred Stock might have been exchanged or surrendered immediately prior to the effective date of such transaction.
Section 4.7.

Upon execution of this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary shall maintain at the Depositary's Office, facilities for the execution and delivery, registration and registration of transfer, surrender and exchange of Receipts, and at the offices of the Depositary's Agents, if any, facilities for the delivery, registration of transfer, surrender and exchange of Receipts, all in accordance with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement.
The Depositary shall keep books at the Depositary's Office for the registration and registration of transfer, surrender and exchange of Receipts, which books at all reasonable times shall be open for inspection by the record holders of Receipts; provided that any such holder requesting to exercise such right shall certify to the Depositary that such inspection shall be for a proper purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as an owner of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts.
The Depositary may close such books, at any time or from time to time, when deemed expedient by it in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder.
The Depositary may, with the approval of the Company, appoint a Registrar for registration of the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby. If the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby or the Series N Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Shares shall be listed on one or more national stock exchanges, the Depositary will appoint a Registrar (acceptable to the Company) for registration of such Receipts or Depositary
 
Shares in accordance with any requirements of such exchange. Such Registrar (which may be the Depositary if so permitted by the requirements of any such exchange) may be removed and a substitute Registrar appointed by the Depositary upon the request or with the approval of the Company. If the Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Series N Preferred Stock are listed on one or more other stock exchanges, the Depositary will, at the request of the Company, arrange such facilities for the delivery, registration, registration of transfer, surrender and exchange of such Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Series N Preferred Stock as may be required by law or applicable stock exchange regulation.

Section 5.3.
Obligations of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar and the Company.
Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Company assumes any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement to holders of Receipts other than for its negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. Notwithstanding anything in this Deposit Agreement to the contrary, neither the Depositary, nor the Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Company shall be liable in any event for special, punitive, incidental, indirect or consequential losses or damages of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits).
Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Company shall be under, any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit or other proceeding in respect of the Series N Preferred Stock, the Depositary Shares or the Receipts which in its opinion may involve it in expense or liability unless indemnity satisfactory to it against all expense and liability be furnished as often as may be required.
 
Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Company shall be liable for any action or any failure to act by it in reliance upon the advice of legal counsel or accountants, or information from any person presenting Series N Preferred Stock for deposit, any holder of a Receipt or any other person believed by it in good faith to be competent to give such information. The Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar and the Company may each rely and shall each be protected in acting upon or omitting to act upon any written notice, request, direction or other document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
The Depositary will indemnify the Company against any liability which may directly arise out of acts performed or omitted by the Depositary due to its gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith, however, in no event shall the Depositary be liable for consequential, special or indirect damages of any kind regardless of whether the Depositary is put on notice of the possibility of such damages. The Depositary shall not be liable for the acts or omissions due to the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of any Depositary's Agent, so long as such Depositary's Agent was appointed with due care.
The Depositary shall not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instruction to vote any of the shares of Series N Preferred Stock or for the manner or effect of any such vote made, as long as any such action or non-action is not taken in bad faith. The Depositary undertakes, and any Registrar shall be required to undertake, to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Deposit Agreement against the Depositary or any Registrar.
The Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, and any Registrar may own and deal in any class of securities of the Company and its affiliates and in Receipts. The Depositary may also act as transfer agent or registrar of any of the securities of the Company and its affiliates.
The Depositary shall not be under any liability for interest on any monies at any time received by it pursuant to any of the provisions of this Deposit Agreement or of the Receipts, the Depositary Shares or the Series N Preferred Stock nor shall it be obligated to segregate such monies from other monies held by it, except as required by law. The Depositary shall not be responsible for advancing funds on behalf of the Company and shall have no duty or obligation to make any payments if it has not timely received sufficient funds to make timely payments.
In the event the Depositary believes any ambiguity or uncertainty exists hereunder or in any notice, instruction, direction, request or other communication, paper or document received by the Depositary hereunder, or in the administration of any of the provisions of this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, omitting or suffering to take any action hereunder, the Depositary may, in its sole discretion upon written notice to the Company, refrain from taking any action and shall be fully protected and shall not be liable in any way to the Company, any holders of Receipts or any other person or entity for refraining from taking such action, unless the Depositary receives written instructions or a certificate signed by the Company which eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of the Depositary or which proves or establishes the applicable matter to the satisfaction of the Depositary. The Depositary shall not be liable to the Company, any holder of Receipts, or any action taken by it in accordance with the written instruction of the Company or the holders of Receipts.
 
Section 5.4.
Resignation and Removal of the Depositary; Appointment of Successor Depositary.

The Depositary may at any time be removed by the Company by notice of such removal delivered to the Depositary, such removal to take effect upon the appointment of a successor Depositary hereunder and its acceptance of such appointment as hereinafter provided.

If no successor Depositary shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment within 60 days after delivery of such notice, the resigning or removed Depositary may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Depositary. Every successor Depositary shall execute and deliver to its predecessor and to the Company an instrument in writing accepting its appointment hereunder, and thereupon such successor Depositary, without any further act or deed, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor and for all purposes shall be the Depositary under this Deposit Agreement, and such predecessor, upon payment of all sums due it and on the written request of the Company, shall promptly execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor all rights and powers of such predecessor hereunder, shall duly assign, transfer and deliver all right, title and interest in the Series N Preferred Stock and any moneys or property held hereunder to such successor, and shall deliver to such successor a list of the record holders of all outstanding Receipts and such records, books and other information in its possession relating thereto. Any successor Depositary shall promptly mail notice of its appointment to the record holders of Receipts.
Any entity into or with which the Depositary may be merged, consolidated or converted shall be the successor of such Depositary without the execution or filing of any document or any further act, and notice thereof shall not be required hereunder.

Such transmission will be at the Company's expense and the Company will provide the Depositary with such number of copies of
 
such documents as the Depositary may reasonably request. In addition, the Depositary will transmit to the record holders of Receipts at the Company's expense such other documents as may be requested by the Company. Unless otherwise required by law, the requirements set forth in this Section 5.5 may be satisfied by publicly filing or furnishing such information with or to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Section 5.6.
Indemnification by the Company.
Notwithstanding Section 5.3 to the contrary, the Company shall indemnify the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent and any Registrar (including each of their officers, directors, agents and employees) against, and hold each of them harmless from, any loss, damage, cost, penalty, liability or expense (including the reasonable costs and expenses of defending itself) which may arise out of acts performed, suffered or omitted to be taken in connection with this Deposit Agreement and the Receipts by the Depositary, any Registrar or any of their respective agents (including any Depositary's Agent) and any transactions or documents contemplated hereby, except for any liability arising out of negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the respective parts of any such person or persons.

The Company shall pay all charges of the Depositary in connection with the initial deposit of the Series N Preferred Stock and the initial issuance of the Depositary Shares, all withdrawals of shares of the Series N Preferred Stock by owners of Depositary Shares, and any redemption or exchange of the Series N Preferred Stock at the option of the Company. The Company shall pay all transfer and other taxes and governmental charges arising solely from the existence of the depositary arrangements. All other transfer and other taxes and governmental charges shall be at the expense of holders of Depositary Shares evidenced by Receipts. If, at the request of a holder of Receipts, the Depositary incurs charges or expenses for which the Company is not otherwise liable hereunder, such holder will be liable for such charges and expenses; provided, however, that the Depositary may, at its sole option, require a holder of a Receipt to prepay the Depositary any charge or expense the Depositary has been asked to incur at the request of such holder of Receipts. The Depositary shall present its statement for charges and expenses to the Company at such intervals as the Company and the Depositary may agree.

Every holder of an outstanding Receipt at the time any such amendment becomes effective shall be deemed, by continuing to hold such Receipt, to consent and agree to such amendment and to be bound by the Deposit Agreement as amended thereby.
