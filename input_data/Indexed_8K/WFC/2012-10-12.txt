Selected Financial Information
 
SAN FRANCISCO  Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC) reported record net income of $4.9 billion, or $0.88 per diluted common share, for third quarter 2012, up from $4.1 billion, or $0.72 per share, for third quarter 2011, and up from $4.6 billion, or $0.82 per share, for second quarter 2012. For the first nine months of 2012, net income was $13.8 billion, or $2.45 per share, compared with $11.8 billion, or $2.09 per share, a year ago.
"Through the efforts of our more than 265,000 team members, we've now achieved six consecutive quarters of record net income and EPS," said Chairman and CEO John Stumpf. "By focusing on earning all of our customers' business and providing outstanding service, we continued to generate growth across our diversified set of businesses. In the third quarter, core loans grew by $11.9 billion and we saw continued strength in our mortgage and deposit businesses. We remained diligent in managing costs and continued to have strong underlying credit performance as our loss mitigation efforts and the low interest rate environment helped improve affordability for our customers."
Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan added, "Our third quarter results demonstrated that the Company's business model continues to serve shareholders well. Our performance reflected an ongoing focus on measures that drive value over the long-term, including increased PTPP, positive operating leverage, and
 
solid ROA and ROE. In addition, our efficiency ratio of 57.1 percent in the third quarter improved compared with second quarter and remained within our 55 to 59 percent targeted range. While the economic and interest rate environments continue to present challenges for us and our industry, our diversified model and focus on our customers continued to produce strong quarterly results."
Revenue
Revenue was $21.2 billion in the third quarter, compared with $21.3 billion in second quarter 2012, as approximately $300 million of higher noninterest income was more than offset by lower net interest income. Businesses generating linked-quarter revenue growth included asset backed finance, asset management, brokerage services, commercial mortgage servicing, credit card, dealer services, debit card, equity funds, personal credit management, real estate capital markets, retail sales finance, retirement services, and small business administration loans.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income was $10.7 billion in third quarter, down from $11.0 billion in second quarter 2012. The decline in net interest income was largely driven by lower income from variable sources, such as fee income and purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loan resolutions which were elevated in the second quarter. In addition, income from the available-for-sale (AFS) securities portfolio declined as the pace of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) pay-downs increased in response to lower interest rates, and we replaced a large portion of the run-off with lower yielding, but shorter duration securities. The income impact of lower levels of long-term securities purchases was partially offset by our retention of $9.8 billion of high-quality, conforming first real estate mortgages.
On a linked-quarter basis, our net interest margin declined 25 basis points to 3.66 percent, driven by three primary items. First, the impact of lower income from variable sources described above caused a decline of approximately 10 basis points. Second, given our cautious stance on investment portfolio growth in the current low rate environment, deposit growth of $23 billion (10 percent annualized) caused cash and short term investments to increase, diluting the margin by approximately 7 basis points. Finally, the impact of lower rates, both in terms of run-off and new activity, reduced the margin by 8 basis points, with approximately 6 basis points of the decline from the AFS portfolio and approximately 2 basis points from the loan portfolios.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income was $10.6 billion, up from $10.3 billion in second quarter 2012. The increase was driven by a $252 million increase in market sensitive revenue, primarily trading gains including deferred compensation plan investments offset in employee benefits expense. The Company also benefitted from increases in deposit service charges, trust and investment fees, and card fees. Insurance declined $108 million due to seasonally lower insurance revenue, with a related decline in insurance commission expense.
 
Mortgage banking noninterest income was $2.8 billion, down $86 million from second quarter 2012, on $139 billion of originations, compared with $131 billion of originations in second quarter. During the third quarter, the Company retained on balance sheet 1-4 family conforming first mortgage loans, forgoing approximately $200 million of fee revenue that could have been generated had the loans been originated for sale during the quarter along with other agency conforming loan production. The Company provided $462 million for mortgage loan repurchase losses, compared with $669 million in second quarter (included in net gains from mortgage loan origination/sales activities). Net mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) results were $142 million, compared with $377 million in second quarter due to MSR valuation adjustments made in the third quarter for increased servicing and foreclosure costs. The ratio of MSRs to related loans serviced for others was at a historical low of 63 basis points and the average note rate on the servicing portfolio was 4.87 percent. The unclosed pipeline at September 30, 2012 was $97 billion, compared with $102 billion at June 30, 2012.
The Company had net unrealized securities gains of $12.4 billion at September 30, 2012, compared with $9.5 billion at June 30, 2012. Period-end securities available for sale balances increased $2.5 billion.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense declined $285 million in the quarter to $12.1 billion, compared with $12.4 billion in second quarter 2012. The decline in noninterest expense was due primarily to $243 million of lower operating losses, $112 million of seasonally lower insurance commissions, $104 million of lower severance expense, and our third consecutive quarterly reduction in foreclosed asset expense, down $42 million from prior quarter. The expense improvements were partially offset by higher deferred compensation expense of $152 million offset in noninterest income and by increases in occupancy and advertising costs. The Company's efficiency ratio improved to 57.1 percent from 58.2 percent in second quarter 2012 and 59.5 percent in third quarter 2011, and the Company is well positioned to remain within its targeted range of 55 to 59 percent in the fourth quarter.
Loans
Total loans were $782.6 billion at September 30, 2012, up $7.4 billion from $775.2 billion at June 30, 2012. Included in this growth was $9.8 billion of 1-4 family conforming first mortgage production retained on the balance sheet. In addition, there was growth in auto, credit card, private student lending, and commercial and industrial (C&I) loan balances. The growth in core loan portfolios more than offset the reduction in the non-strategic/liquidating portfolios, which declined $4.5 billion in the quarter.
 
 
 
Deposits
Average core deposits were $895.4 billion, up 7 percent from a year ago and up 7 percent (annualized) from second quarter 2012. Average core checking and savings deposits were $837.2 billion, up 9 percent from a year ago and up 8 percent (annualized) from second quarter 2012. Average mortgage escrow deposits were $40.0 billion, compared with $28.3 billion a year ago and $35.4 billion in second quarter 2012. Average core checking and savings deposits were 94 percent of average core deposits, up from 93 percent in the prior quarter and 92 percent a year ago. The average deposit cost for third quarter 2012 was 18 basis points, compared with 19 basis points in second quarter 2012. Average core deposits were 115 percent of average loans, up slightly from second quarter 2012.
Capital
Capital increased in the third quarter, with Tier 1 common equity reaching $105.8 billion under Basel I, or 10.06 percent of risk-weighted assets. The third quarter ratio reflected refinements to the risk weighting of certain unused lending commitments that provide for the ability to issue standby letters of credit, which reduced the ratio by 32 basis points. This refinement did not affect our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel III capital proposals, which rose to 8.02 percent at the end of the quarter.
In third quarter, the Company purchased approximately 17 million shares of its common stock and an additional estimated 9 million shares through a forward repurchase transaction expected to settle in fourth quarter 2012, and paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.22 per share.
 
 
Credit Quality
"Underlying credit quality continued to show improvement in the third quarter, as the overall financial condition of businesses and consumers strengthened, the housing market in many areas of the nation improved, and we continued to work to reduce problem assets and make new, high quality loans," said Chief Risk Officer Mike Loughlin.
Reported credit metrics for the quarter were affected by the implementation in third quarter of the OCC guidance, which affected consumer loans where the borrower's obligation to us has been discharged in bankruptcy and the borrower has not reaffirmed the debt. As of September 30, 2012, only 8 percent of loans within this category were 30 days or more past due. Implementation of the OCC guidance affected nonperforming loans and net charge-offs as follows:
 
 
 
"Excluding the impact of the OCC guidance, we saw improvement in charge-offs, recoveries, and nonperforming assets. Early stage delinquencies remained relatively stable from prior quarter. Absent significant deterioration in the economy, we continue to expect future reserve releases," said Loughlin.
Net Loan Charge-offs
Net loan charge-offs, summarized in the table below, were $2.4 billion in third quarter 2012 or 121 basis points of average loans. Excluding the $567 million in charge-offs resulting from implementation of the OCC guidance, net charge-offs were $1.8 billion or 92 basis points with commercial losses of $217 million, or 24 basis points, and consumer losses of $1.6 billion or 148 basis points

Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets increased by $368 million in the quarter including a $1.4 billion increase in nonperforming loans resulting from implementation of the OCC guidance, ending the quarter at $25.3 billion, compared with $24.9 billion in second quarter 2012. Nonaccrual loans increased to $21.0 billion from $20.6 billion in second quarter; however, apart from implementing the OCC guidance, total commercial and consumer nonaccrual loans declined in the quarter by $975 million. Foreclosed assets were $4.2 billion, down from $4.3 billion in second quarter 2012.

Management believes that the presentation in this news release of information excluding the impact of the OCC guidance provides useful disclosure regarding the underlying credit quality of the Company's loan portfolios.
 
Nonperforming Assets (Nonaccrual Loans and Foreclosed Assets)
 
 
Loans 90 Days or More Past Due and Still Accruing
Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing (excluding government insured/guaranteed) totaled $1.5 billion at September 30, 2012, compared with $1.4 billion at June 30, 2012. Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing with repayments insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or predominantly guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for mortgages and the U.S. Department of Education for student loans under the Federal Family Education Loan Program were $21.4 billion at September 30, 2012, down slightly from $21.5 billion at June 30, 2012.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for unfunded commitments, totaled $17.8 billion at September 30, 2012, down from $18.6 billion at June 30, 2012. The reduction in the allowance included $567 million of net charge-offs resulting from implementation of the OCC guidance. While the impact of the OCC guidance accelerated charge-offs of performing consumer loans into the third quarter, the allowance for credit losses had full coverage for these charge-offs. The reduction also included a $200 million reserve release due to strong underlying credit, compared with a $400 million release in the prior quarter. The allowance coverage to total loans was 2.27 percent, compared with 2.41 percent in second quarter 2012. The allowance covered 1.9 times annualized third quarter net charge-offs, compared with 2.1 times in the prior quarter. The allowance coverage to nonaccrual loans was 85 percent at September 30, 2012, compared with 91 percent at June 30, 2012. "We believe the allowance was appropriate for losses inherent in the loan portfolio at September 30, 2012," said Loughlin.

These products include investment, insurance and trust services in 39 states and D.C., and mortgage and home equity loans in all 50 states and D.C. through its Regional Banking and Wells Fargo Home Mortgage business units
Selected Financial Information
 
Community Banking reported net income of $2.7 billion, up $205 million, or 8 percent, from second quarter 2012. Revenue increased $18 million from second quarter 2012, primarily due to continued growth in deposit service charges and higher gains on deferred compensation plan investments (offset in employee benefits expense), offset by lower investment income and mortgage banking revenue. Noninterest expense decreased $178 million, or 2 percent, from second quarter 2012, largely the result of lower operating losses and lower severance expense associated with our efficiency and cost save initiatives, partially offset by higher deferred compensation expense (offset in revenue).
Net income was up $416 million, or 18 percent, from third quarter 2011. Revenue increased $600 million, or 5 percent, primarily due to higher volume-related mortgage banking income and growth in deposit service charges, partially mitigated by higher equity gains in prior year, planned runoff of non-strategic loan balances and lower debit card revenue due to regulatory changes enacted in October 2011. Noninterest expense increased $497 million, or 7 percent, from third quarter 2011, largely the result of higher mortgage volume-related expenses and operating losses. The provision for credit losses was $347 million lower than a year ago due to improved portfolio performance.

Selected Financial Information
 
Wholesale Banking reported record net income of $2.0 billion, up $112 million, or 6 percent, from second quarter 2012. Revenue of $5.9 billion decreased 3 percent from second quarter 2012 as strong growth across many businesses, including asset-backed finance, asset management, real estate capital markets, and sales and trading, was more than offset by seasonally lower crop insurance revenue and lower PCI resolution income. Noninterest expense decreased $205 million, or 7 percent, from second quarter 2012 on seasonally lower insurance commissions and lower foreclosed asset expense. The provision for credit losses reflected a net reversal of $57 million in third quarter, compared with a provision of $188 million in second quarter. This was due both to a lower level of net loan charge-offs and an increase in the reserve release.
Net income was up $190 million, or 11 percent, from third quarter 2011 led by higher pre-tax pre provision income and lower net charge-offs. Revenue increased $814 million, or 16 percent, from third quarter 2011 driven by broad-based business growth, including acquisitions and strong loan and deposit growth. Noninterest expense increased $219 million, or 8 percent, from third quarter 2011 due to higher personnel expenses related to revenue growth and higher non-personnel expenses related to growth initiatives and compliance and regulatory requirements. Despite an improvement of $119 million in net charge-offs, the provision for credit losses was $121 million higher than third quarter 2011 due to $240 million in lower reserve releases. The third quarter 2012 provision included a $110 million reserve release, compared with $350 million a year ago.

Selected Financial Information
 
Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement reported net income of $338 million, down $5 million from second quarter 2012. Revenue was $3.0 billion, up 2 percent from second quarter 2012, and benefited from $45 million in gains on deferred compensation plan investments (offset in expense, compared with $31 million in losses in second quarter 2012). Excluding deferred compensation, revenue was flat due to lower net interest income and reduced securities gains in the brokerage business, partially offset by higher asset-based fees and brokerage transaction revenue. Total provision for credit losses decreased $7 million from second quarter 2012. The provision in both periods included a $10 million credit reserve release. Noninterest expense increased 3 percent from second quarter 2012 related to higher deferred compensation plan expense. Third quarter 2012 results included $45 million in deferred compensation plan expense, compared with a $32 million benefit in second quarter. Apart from the $77 million change in deferred compensation plan expense, noninterest expense was flat.
 
Net income rose $48 million from third quarter 2011. Revenue increased 5 percent from third quarter 2011 due to $45 million in gains on deferred compensation plan investments (offset in expense, compared with $128 million in losses in third quarter 2011). Excluding deferred compensation, revenue was down 1 percent primarily due to lower net interest income and reduced securities gains in the brokerage business, partially offset by growth in managed account fee revenue. Total provision for credit losses decreased $18 million from third quarter 2011. Noninterest expense increased 4 percent from third quarter 2011 driven by higher deferred compensation plan expense. Third quarter 2012 results included $45 million in deferred compensation plan expense, compared with a $125 million benefit a year ago. Apart from the $170 million change in deferred compensation plan expense, noninterest expense decreased 3 percent.

Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Information
In accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we caution you that this news release contains forward-looking statements about our future financial performance and business. We make forward-looking statements when we use words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "target," "should," "may," "can," "will," "outlook," "project," "appears" or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements in this news release include, among others, statements about: (i) future credit quality and performance, and the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses, including our current expectation of future reserve releases; (ii) our expectations regarding noninterest expense and our targeted efficiency ratio for the remainder of 2012 as part of our expense management initiatives; and (iii) our estimate regarding our Tier 1 common equity ratio under proposed Basel III capital rules as of September 30, 2012.
Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements as actual results could differ materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and we do not undertake to update them to reflect changes or events that occur after that date. Several factors could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations including: current and future economic and market conditions, including the effects of further declines in housing prices, high unemployment rates, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax matters, and the sovereign debt crisis and economic difficulties in Europe; our capital requirements (including under regulatory capital standards as determined and interpreted by applicable regulatory authorities such as the proposed Basel III capital rules) and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms; financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses (including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act), as well as our ability to mitigate the loss of revenue and income from financial services reform and other regulation and legislation; the extent of success in our loan modification efforts, including the effects of regulatory requirements, or changes in regulatory requirements, relating to loan modifications; the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands that we receive and our ability to satisfy any such demands without having to repurchase loans related thereto or otherwise indemnify or reimburse third parties; negative effects relating to mortgage servicing and foreclosures, as well as effects associated with our settlement with the Department of Justice and other federal and state government entities related to our mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices, including changes in our procedures or practices and/or industry standards or practices, regulatory or judicial requirements, penalties or fines, increased servicing and other costs or obligations, including loan modification requirements, or delays or moratoriums on foreclosures; our ability to realize our efficiency ratio target as part of our expense management initiatives when and in the range targeted, including as a result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, changes in our business composition and operating environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, litigation and regulatory matters; a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers; recognition of other-than-temporary impairment on securities held in our available-for-sale portfolio; the effect of the current low interest rate environment or changes in interest rates on our net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale; hedging gains or losses; disruptions in the capital markets and reduced investor demand for mortgage loans; our ability to sell more products to our customers; the effect of fluctuations in stock market prices on fee income from our brokerage, asset and wealth management businesses; our election to provide support to our money market funds; changes in the value of our venture capital investments; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards or in how accounting standards are to be applied; changes in our credit ratings and changes in the credit ratings of our customers or counterparties; mergers and acquisitions; federal and state regulations; reputational damage from negative publicity, fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations and legal actions; the loss of checking and saving account deposits to other investments such as the stock market; and fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board. There is no assurance that our allowance for credit losses will be adequate to cover future credit losses, especially if housing prices decline and unemployment worsens. Increases in loan charge-offs or in the allowance for credit losses and related provision expense could materially adversely affect our financial results and condition. For more information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the discussion under "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, as filed with the SEC and available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Any factor described above or in our SEC reports could, by itself or together with one or more other factors, adversely affect our financial results and condition.

Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries
PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (PCI) LOANS
Loans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected are considered to be credit impaired. PCI loans predominately represent loans acquired from Wachovia that were deemed to be credit impaired. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include statistics such as past due and nonaccrual status, recent borrower credit scores and recent LTV percentages. PCI loans are initially measured at fair value, which includes estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan. Accordingly, the associated allowance for credit losses related to these loans is not carried over at the acquisition date.
Under the accounting guidance for PCI loans, the excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans, in situations where there is a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected. Accordingly, such loans are not classified as nonaccrual and they are considered to be accruing because their interest income relates to the accretable yield recognized under accounting for PCI loans and not to contractual interest payments. The difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference.
Subsequent to acquisition, we regularly evaluate our estimates of cash flows expected to be collected. These evaluations, performed quarterly, require the continued usage of key assumptions and estimates, similar to the initial estimate of fair value. If we have probable decreases in the expected cash flows (other than due to a decrease in rate indices), we charge the provision for credit losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. If we have probable and significant increases in the expected cash flows subsequent to establishing an additional allowance, we first reverse any previously established allowance and then increase interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans.
As a result of PCI loan accounting, certain credit-related ratios cannot be used to compare a portfolio that includes PCI loans against one that does not, or to compare ratios across quarters or years. The ratios particularly affected include the allowance for loan losses and allowance for credit losses as percentages of loans, of nonaccrual loans and of nonperforming assets; nonaccrual loans and nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans; and net charge-offs as a percentage of loans.

CHANGES IN NONACCRETABLE DIFFERENCE FOR PCI LOANS
The difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. A nonaccretable difference is established in purchase accounting for PCI loans to absorb losses expected at that time on those loans. Amounts absorbed by the nonaccretable difference do not affect the income statement or the allowance for credit losses. Substantially all our commercial and industrial, CRE and foreign PCI loans are accounted for as individual loans. Conversely, Pick-a-Pay and other consumer PCI loans have been aggregated into several pools based on common risk characteristics. Each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. Resolutions of loans may include sales to third parties, receipt of payments in settlement with the borrower, or foreclosure of the collateral. Our policy is to remove an individual loan from a pool based on comparing the amount received from its resolution with its contractual amount. Any difference between these amounts is absorbed by the nonaccretable difference. This removal method assumes that the amount received from resolution approximates pool performance expectations. The accretable yield percentage is unaffected by the resolution and any changes in the effective yield for the remaining loans in the pool are addressed by our quarterly cash flow evaluation process for each pool. For loans that are resolved by payment in full, there is no release of the nonaccretable difference for the pool because there is no difference between the amount received at resolution and the contractual amount of the loan. Modified PCI loans are not removed from a pool even if those loans would otherwise be deemed troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). Modified PCI loans that are accounted for individually are considered TDRs, and removed from PCI accounting, if there has been a concession granted in excess of the original nonaccretable difference. The following table provides an analysis of changes in the nonaccretable difference.

CHANGES IN ACCRETABLE YIELD RELATED TO PCI LOANS
The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying value of PCI loans is referred to as the accretable yield and is accreted into interest income over the estimated lives of the PCI loans using the effective yield method. The accretable yield is affected by:
 
 
 
The change in the accretable yield related to PCI loans is presented in the following table.
 
 
CHANGES IN ALLOWANCE FOR PCI LOAN LOSSES
When it is estimated that the expected cash flows have decreased subsequent to acquisition for a PCI loan or pool of loans, an allowance is established and a provision for additional loss is recorded as a charge to income. The following table summarizes the changes in allowance for PCI loan losses.
