Pursuant to the Calculation Agent Agreement, the Company may appoint a different Calculation Agent from time to time after the initial issuance of this Security without the consent of the Holder of this Security and without notifying the Holder of this Security.
Calculation Agent
 
Market Disruption Events
A "" means, with respect to the Fund, any of the following events as determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion:
Market Disruption Event
 
 
 
 
 
 
For purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred:
 
 
Anti-dilution Adjustments Relating to the Fund; Alternate Calculation
Anti-dilution Adjustments
The Calculation Agent will adjust the Adjustment Factor with respect to the Fund as specified below if any of the events specified below occurs with respect to the Fund and the effective date or ex-dividend date, as applicable, for such event is after the Pricing Date and on or prior to the Calculation Day.
The adjustments specified below do not cover all events that could affect the Fund. The Calculation Agent may, in its sole discretion, make additional adjustments to any terms of this Security upon the occurrence of other events that affect or could potentially affect the market price of, or shareholder rights in, the Fund, with a view to offsetting, to the extent practical, any such change, and preserving the relative investment risks of this Security. In addition, the Calculation Agent may, in its sole discretion, make adjustments or a series of adjustments that differ from those described herein if the Calculation Agent determines that such adjustments do not properly reflect the economic consequences of the events specified herein or would not preserve the relative investment risks of this Security. All determinations made by the Calculation Agent in making any adjustments to the terms of this Security, including adjustments that are in addition to, or that differ from, those described herein, will be made in good faith and a commercially reasonable manner, with the aim of ensuring an equitable result. In determining whether to make any adjustment to the terms of this Security, the Calculation Agent may consider any adjustment made by the Options Clearing Corporation or any other equity derivatives clearing organization on options contracts on the Fund.
For any event described below, the Calculation Agent will not be required to adjust the Adjustment Factor unless the adjustment would result in a change to the Adjustment Factor then in effect of at least 0.10%. The Adjustment Factor resulting from any adjustment will be rounded up or down, as appropriate, to the nearest one-hundred thousandth.
 
If a stock split or reverse stock split has occurred, then once such split has become effective, the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the number of securities which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of the Fund before the effective date of such stock split or reverse stock split would have owned or been entitled to receive immediately following the applicable effective date.
 
If a dividend or distribution of shares (or other applicable securities) to which this Security is linked has been made by the Fund ratably to all holders of record of such shares (or other applicable security), then the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted on the ex-dividend date to equal the prior Adjustment Factor plus the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the number of shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of the Fund before the ex-dividend date would have owned or been entitled to receive immediately following that date; provided, however, that no adjustment will be made for a distribution for which the number of securities of the Fund paid or distributed is based on a fixed cash equivalent value.
 
If an Extraordinary Dividend (as defined below) has occurred, then the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted on the ex-dividend date to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and a fraction, the numerator of which is the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of the Fund on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date, and the denominator of which is the amount by which the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of the Fund on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date exceeds the Extraordinary Dividend Amount (as defined below).
For purposes of determining whether an Extraordinary Dividend has occurred:
 
 
A distribution on the securities of the Fund described below under the section entitled "Reorganization Events" below that also constitutes an Extraordinary Dividend will only cause an adjustment pursuant to that "Reorganization Events" section.
 
If the Fund declares or makes a distribution to all holders of the shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund of any non-cash assets, excluding dividends or distributions described under the section entitled "Stock Dividends" above, then the Calculation Agent may, in its sole discretion, make such adjustment (if
 
any) to the Adjustment Factor as it deems appropriate in the circumstances. If the Calculation Agent determines to make an adjustment pursuant to this paragraph, it will do so with a view to offsetting, to the extent practical, any change in the economic position of a holder of this Security that results solely from the applicable event.
 
If the Fund, or any Successor Fund, is subject to a merger, combination, consolidation or statutory exchange of securities with another exchange traded fund, and the Fund to which this Security is linked is not the surviving entity (a ""), then, on or after the date of such event, the Calculation Agent shall, in its sole discretion, make an adjustment to the Adjustment Factor or the method of determining the Redemption Amount or any other terms of this Security as the Calculation Agent determines appropriate to account for the economic effect on this Security of such event, and determine the effective date of that adjustment. If the Calculation Agent determines that no adjustment that it could make will produce a commercially reasonable result, then the Calculation Agent may deem such event a Liquidation Event (as defined below).
Reorganization Event
Liquidation Events
If the Fund is de-listed, liquidated or otherwise terminated (a ""), and a successor or substitute exchange traded fund exists that the Calculation Agent determines, in its sole discretion, to be comparable to the Fund, then, upon the Calculation Agent's notification of that determination to the Trustee and the Company, any subsequent Fund Closing Price for the Fund will be determined by reference to the Fund Closing Price of such successor or substitute exchange traded fund (such exchange traded fund being referred to herein as a ""), with such adjustments as the Calculation Agent determines are appropriate to account for the economic effect of such substitution on the holder of this Security.
Liquidation Event
Successor Fund
If the Fund undergoes a Liquidation Event prior to, and such Liquidation Event is continuing on, the date that any Fund Closing Price of the Fund is to be determined and the Calculation Agent determines that no Successor Fund is available at such time, then the Calculation Agent will, in its discretion, calculate the Fund Closing Price for the Fund on such date by a computation methodology that the Calculation Agent determines will as closely as reasonably possible replicate the Fund, provided that if the Calculation Agent determines in its discretion that it is not practicable to replicate the Fund (including but not limited to the instance in which the sponsor of the index underlying the Fund discontinues publication of that index), then the Calculation Agent will calculate the Fund Closing Price for the Fund in accordance with the formula last used to calculate such Fund Closing Price before such Liquidation Event, but using only those securities that were held by the Fund immediately prior to such Liquidation Event without any rebalancing or substitution of such securities following such Liquidation Event.
If a Successor Fund is selected or the Calculation Agent calculates the Fund Closing Price as a substitute for the Fund, such Successor Fund or Fund Closing Price will be used as a substitute for the Fund for all purposes, including for purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event exists.
 
If any event is both a Reorganization Event and a Liquidation Event, such event will be treated as a Reorganization Event for purposes of this Security unless the Calculation Agent makes the determination referenced in the last sentence of the section entitled "Anti-dilution AdjustmentsReorganization Events" above.
Calculation Agent
The Calculation Agent will determine the Redemption Amount and the Ending Price. In addition, the Calculation Agent will (i) determine if adjustments are required to the Fund Closing Price and/or the Adjustment Factor under the circumstances described in this Security, (ii) if the Fund undergoes a Liquidation Event, select a Successor Fund or, if no Successor Fund is available, determine the Fund Closing Price of the Fund, and (iii) determine whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred.
The Company covenants that, so long as this Security is Outstanding, there shall at all times be a Calculation Agent (which shall be a broker-dealer, bank or other financial institution) with respect to this Security.
All determinations made by the Calculation Agent with respect to this Security will be at the sole discretion of the Calculation Agent and, in the absence of manifest error, will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the Holder of this Security. All percentages and other amounts resulting from any calculation with respect to this Security will be rounded at the Calculation Agent's discretion.
Tax Considerations
The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a beneficial ownership interest in this Security each Holder of this Security will be deemed to have agreed (in the absence of a statutory, regulatory, administrative or judicial ruling to the contrary), for United States federal income tax purposes to characterize and treat this Security as a pre-paid derivative contract in respect of the Fund.
Redemption and Repayment
This Security is not subject to redemption at the option of the Company or repayment at the option of the Holder hereof prior to June 16, 2014. This Security is not entitled to any sinking fund.
Acceleration
If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to this Security shall occur and be continuing, the Redemption Amount (calculated as set forth in the next sentence) of this Security may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The amount payable to the Holder hereof upon any acceleration permitted under the Indenture will be equal to the Redemption Amount hereof calculated as provided herein as though the date of acceleration was the Calculation Day.
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature or its duly authorized agent under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.
