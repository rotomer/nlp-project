Exhibit 99.1 Whole Foods Market Reports Third Quarter Results Sales Increase 15% Driven by 11% Square Footage Growth and 7.6% Comparable Store Sales Growth; Company Ends Quarter With $131 Million in Cash The Company will host a conference call today to discuss this earnings announcement at 4:00 p.m. CDT. The dial in number is 1-800-362-0571 and the conference ID is 'Whole Foods.' A replay will be available for approximately 48 hours at 402-220-2985. A simultaneous audio web cast will also be available at www.wholefoodsmarket.com . The audio web cast will be archived for thirty days. AUSTIN, Texas, July 30 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Whole Foods Market, Inc. (Nasdaq: WFMI) today reported sales and earnings for the third quarter ended July 6, 2003. Sales for the 12-week period increased 15% to $749 million. This increase was driven by 11% weighted average year-over-year square footage growth and comparable store sales growth of 7.6%. The Company estimates the Easter shift, from the second quarter last year to the third quarter this year, positively impacted this quarter's comps by approximately 50 basis points. Sales in identical stores (excluding one relocated store and two major store expansions) increased 7.0% for the quarter. "We are pleased with our 7.6% comparable store sales increase during the quarter given our tough 10.5% comparison in the prior year. These results are consistent with our 18% two-year average comp for the past four years," said John Mackey, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Whole Foods Market. "All three Harry's Farmers Market stores showed positive comps for the third quarter, and we now expect them to have a slightly positive impact on our comparable store sales in the fourth quarter. We are seeing a slight improvement in our overall comparable store sales growth, which has averaged 8% over the last six weeks." On October 11, 2002, United Natural Foods acquired Blooming Prairie Cooperative, a cooperative natural foods distributor in which the Company was a member, for cash consideration of $30 million. Blooming Prairie Cooperative distributed 90% of the proceeds from the sale to its former members during the third quarter; 10% of the proceeds were retained for future contingencies. The Company has recognized a pre-tax gain included in investment and other income of approximately $3 million, or approximately $0.03 in diluted earnings per share, as a result of this distribution. Any further distributions from Blooming Prairie Cooperative will be accounted for if and when received. Net income for the quarter increased 30% to $28.7 million from $22.1 million in the prior year, and diluted earnings per share increased 26% to $0.45 compared to $0.36 in the prior year. Excluding the Blooming Prairie gain, adjusted net income for the quarter increased 22% to $26.9 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 18% to $0.42. For the forty-week period ended July 30, 2003, sales increased 17% to $2.4 billion, with sales in comparable stores increasing 8.5% and sales in identical stores increasing 8.0%. Net income year to date increased 28% to $79.9 million, or $1.28 per share, from $62.4 million, or $1.04 per share in the prior year. Excluding the Blooming Prairie gain, adjusted net income year to date increased 25% to $78.1 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 20% to $1.25. For the quarter, net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) increased 29% to $30.3 million. The Company's capital charge for the quarter was $28.8 million, resulting in Economic Value Added (EVA) of $1.5 million, a $2.6 million improvement over the prior year. Store returns for the third quarter: # of Average Average NOPAT Comp Size Comps ROIC Stores Stores over eight years old 27,200 5.7% 54% 52 Stores between five and eight years old 28,600 5.2% 52% 35 Stores between two and five years old 36,500 9.5% 22% 33 Stores less than two years old (including relocations) 35,700 21.4% 5% 13 All stores in comparable store base 30,700 7.6% 33% 133 All stores open at the end of the third quarter 31,000 29% 144 Gross profit in the third quarter increased 14% to $258.6 million, or 34.5% of sales, from $226.1 million, or 34.9% of sales, in the prior year. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased 33 basis points primarily due to higher occupancy costs, including utilities, repairs and rent. Direct store expenses increased 16% to $186.9 million from $161.4 million in the prior year, an increase of seven basis points as a percentage of sales. Store contribution increased 11% to $71.7 million from $64.7 million in the prior year, a decrease of 41 basis points as a percentage of sales. General and administrative (G&A) expenses increased 4% to $23.9 million compared to $22.9 million in the prior year, an improvement of 34 basis points as a percentage of sales. For the 133 stores in the comparable store base, a 14 basis point improvement in direct store expenses was offset by a 16 basis point decrease in gross profit, resulting in a two basis point decrease in store contribution to 10.0% of sales. For the quarter, the Company produced cash flow from operations of $64 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $36 million of which $18 million was for new store development. At the end of the quarter, the Company had approximately $131 million in cash and approximately $167 million in long-term debt. Long-term debt includes $150 million in Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures. For the fourth consecutive quarter, the Company has had no amounts drawn on its line of credit. In the third quarter, the Company opened one new store in Sacramento, CA, ending the quarter with 144 stores. Total square footage open at the end of the third quarter was approximately 4.5 million. Due to some last minute permitting delays, the Company's new store in Santa Monica opened on July 16th instead of during the third quarter as originally anticipated. The Company has recently signed leases for five new stores in Chevy Chase, MD; Charlottesville, VA; Baton Rouge, LA; New Orleans, LA; and Atlanta, GA. The Company currently has 29 stores in development averaging 45,000 square feet in size. Square footage under development totals approximately 1.3 million square feet. Following are certain historical results for all stores for the past four fiscal years as well as year to date for the current fiscal year including gross profit, direct store expenses, store contribution, and general and administrative expenses (G&A) excluding goodwill amortization in all years, as a percentage of sales. One-year comparable store sales increases and the sum of two years of comparable store sales increases (two-year comps) are also included. 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003YTD Gross profit 34.0% 34.5% 34.8% 34.7% 34.3% Direct store expenses 24.4% 25.0% 25.3% 25.1% 25.1% Store contribution 9.6% 9.4% 9.5% 9.6% 9.2% G&A (excl. goodwill) 3.9% 3.3% 3.6% 3.6% 3.2% Comps 7.7% 8.6% 9.2% 10.0% 8.5% Two-year comps 18.7% 16.3% 17.8% 19.2% 18.5% Goals for fiscal year 2003: For fiscal year 2003, the Company expects sales growth to be at the low end of the 15% to 20% range. In the fourth quarter, the Company is up against two years of over 10% comparable sales increases, and comparable store sales growth is expected to be in the range of 6.5% to 8.5%. The Company expects weighted average square footage growth of 11% for the year, including expansions of existing stores. Including Santa Monica, the Company expects to open three stores in the fourth quarter, one of which will be a relocation of an existing 17,600 square foot store location to a new 51,300 square foot store location. The Company expects gross profit for the fiscal year to be lower as a percentage of sales compared to the prior year based on year to date results and a difficult LIFO comparison in the fourth quarter. The Company had a $3.4 million LIFO credit in the fourth quarter of last year and expects to record a charge in the fourth quarter of this year. The Company expects an improvement in operating margin driven by lower general and administrative expenses and pre-opening expenses as a percentage of sales. Pre-opening and relocation expense is expected to be approximately $10 million. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be in the range of $160 million to $180 million. The Company expects net interest expense for the year to be between $5 million and $6 million. This includes the $1.4 million pre-tax impairment charge to the Company's Gaiam, Inc. investment in the first quarter but excludes the $3.0 million pre-tax gain from the Blooming Prairie sale in the third quarter. The Company expects fourth quarter diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.39. Excluding the $0.03 diluted earnings per share gain from the sale of Blooming Prairie, the Company expects diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year to be at the lower end of the $1.62 to $1.69 range. The Company's guidance includes the pre-tax impairment charge of $1.4 million, or $0.01 in diluted earnings per share, taken in the first quarter relating to the Company's investment in Gaiam, Inc. but does not include any potential further impairment charge relating to this investment. Goals for fiscal year 2004: For fiscal year 2004, the Company expects total sales growth to be at the low end of the 15% to 20% range. The Company expects comparable store sales growth of 7% to 9% and weighted average square footage growth of 10% to 11% relating to the opening of 12 to 15 new stores. While the Company has built a strong pipeline of new stores, it will take some time before these stores start to open. Therefore, the Company does not foresee an acceleration in new store openings until late in the fiscal year. Square footage growth is expected to be higher in the second half of the fiscal year given the projected timing of new store openings. The Company expects diluted earnings per share of $1.87 to $1.95. The Company will give more detailed forward- looking guidance for the 2004 fiscal year when it releases fourth quarter and fiscal year 2003 results in mid-November.
