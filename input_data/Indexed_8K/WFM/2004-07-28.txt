AUSTIN, Texas, July 28 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Whole Foods Market, Inc. (Nasdaq: WFMI) today reported sales and earnings for the third quarter ended July 4, 2004. Sales for the 12-week quarter increased 22% to $917 million from $749 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by 9% weighted average year-over-year square footage growth and comparable store sales growth of 14.1%. Sales in identical stores (excluding two relocated stores and two major store expansions) increased 13.7% for the quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 15% to $32.9 million from $28.7 million in the prior year, and diluted earnings per share increased 10% to $0.50 from $0.45 in the prior year. Excluding the pre-tax gain of approximately $3 million, or approximately $0.03 in diluted earnings per share, related to the distribution of proceeds from the sale of Blooming Prairie Cooperative in the prior year, net income for the quarter increased 22% and diluted earnings per share increased 17%. Net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) increased 12% to $34.0 million for the quarter. The Company's capital charge for the quarter was $31.1 million, resulting in Economic Value Added (EVA) of $2.9 million. Store Returns for the Quarter: # of Average Average NOPAT Comp Size Comps ROIC Stores Stores over eight years old 28,100 12.0% 59% 64 Stores between five and eight years old 31,700 11.7% 43% 26 Stores between two and five years old 36,500 14.6% 23% 36 Stores less than two years old (including relocations) 36,000 25.9% 13% 17 All stores in comparable store base 31,800 14.1% 34% 143 All stores open at the end of the third quarter 31,300 29% 160 "We are experiencing one of the best years in our company's history with sales increasing 23% to $2.9 billion, net income increasing 34% to $107 million, which is more than we earned in all of last fiscal year, and EVA improving over $10 million," said John Mackey, Whole Foods Market CEO, President, Chairman and Co-founder. "Our comparable stores are producing record sales increases of 15.2% year to date, and our new stores continue to open above our expectations producing $595,000 in average weekly sales. We believe our strong results are due in part to the growing equity of the Whole Foods Market brand and demonstrate the tremendous growth opportunities that lie ahead for our company." In the third quarter, gross profit increased two basis points to 34.6% of sales, and direct store expenses increased 35 basis points to 25.3% of sales, resulting in a 33 basis point decrease in store contribution to 9.3% of sales. For the 143 stores in the comparable store base, gross profit improved 41 basis points to 34.9% of sales, and direct store expenses increased 10 basis points to 25.0% of sales, resulting in a 32 basis point increase in store contribution to 9.8% of sales. General and administrative (G&A) expenses decreased 19 basis points to 3.0% of sales. In the third quarter, the Company opened five new stores in Charleston, SC; White Plains, NY; Fort Collins, CO; Bellevue, WA and Glendale, CA (a relocation), ending the quarter with 160 stores totaling approximately five million square feet. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $62 million of which $37 million was for new store development. The Company produced cash flow from operations of $57 million during the quarter. Cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, totaled approximately $213 million at the end of the third quarter, and long-term debt, which includes $157 million in Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures, was approximately $168 million. On July 19, 2004, the Company paid approximately $9 million to shareholders in its third quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. Stores in Development The Company is pleased to announce the recent signing of eight new store leases in Redmond, WA; New York, NY; Henderson, NV; Charlotte, NC; Cranston, RI; Woburn, MA; Manhattan Beach, CA; and Austin, TX (a relocation). The following table provides additional information about the Company's store development pipeline. 7/28/04 7/30/03 % Change Number 49 29 69% Average size (gross square feet) 47,800 44,800 7% As a percentage of existing store average size 153% 145% --- Total square footage under development 2,351,000 1,335,000 76% As a percentage of existing square footage 47% 30% --- Historical Performance Following are certain historical results as a percentage of sales for all stores for the last four fiscal years, the four-year average through fiscal year 2003, and year to date for the current fiscal year. This information is included in order to emphasize the general consistency of the Company's results as a percentage of sales over this period of time. Total sales growth, percent of sales from comparable stores, one-year comparable store sales increases and the sum of two years of comparable store sales increases (two-year comps) are also included. 4-Year 2004 2000 2001 2002 2003 Average YTD Gross profit 34.5% 34.8% 34.7% 34.3% 34.5% 34.8% Direct store expenses 25.0% 25.3% 25.1% 25.2% 25.2% 25.3% Store contribution 9.4% 9.5% 9.6% 9.2% 9.4% 9.5% G&A (excl. goodwill amort.) 3.3% 3.6% 3.6% 3.2% 3.4% 3.1% Sales growth 23.2% 23.6% 18.4% 17.0% 20.5% 22.5% % of sales from comp stores 86.3% 89.0% 90.1% 91.8% 89.7% 91.3% Comps 8.6% 9.2% 10.0% 8.6% 9.1% 15.2% Two-year comps 16.3% 17.8% 19.2% 18.6% 18.0% 23.7% Goals for Fiscal Year 2004 The Company expects comparable store sales growth for the fourth quarter to be in the range of 11% to 13%. This guidance range reflects the above average comparable store sales growth the Company has been experiencing this year while taking into account the tougher year-over-year comparison in the fourth quarter. The Company expects to open four new stores in the fourth quarter. Based on the Company's strong year-to-date results, sales growth for the fiscal year is expected to be at the high end of the Company's previously stated 18% to 22% range of guidance. The Company expects operating margin improvement in fiscal year 2004 primarily due to an increase in gross margin, along with slight improvements in G&A and pre-opening and relocation expenses as a percentage of sales. The Company expects diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year to be at the higher end of its previously stated $2.03 to $2.10 range of guidance. Goals for Fiscal Year 2005 For fiscal year 2005, the Company expects total sales and earnings growth in line with its stated long-term goal of 15% to 20%. The Company expects weighted average square footage growth of approximately 15%. The Company faces difficult comparisons with regard to sales growth, comparable store sales increases, and diluted earnings per share growth due to the Company's above-average results so far in fiscal year 2004. Additionally, diluted earnings per share growth could be lower than sales growth due to an expected acceleration in square footage growth which would result in higher pre-opening expense and could have some negative impact on store contribution, as new stores generally have lower gross margins and higher direct store expenses than more mature stores.
