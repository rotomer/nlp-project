Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
As of October 1, 2004, we executed a five-year revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") totaling $100 million, which replaced our existing revolving credit facility. The Credit Facility was obtained for general corporate purposes. J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. arranged the Credit Facility on our behalf. JP Morgan Chase Bank will serve as Administrative Agent for the Credit Facility.
 
Under the terms of the Credit Facility, we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit of $100 million less any outstanding letters of credit. The interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Facility ranges from 0.50% to 1.375% over the "London Interbank Offered Rate" ("LIBOR") or 0.00% over an alternative Base Rate, which is the greater of the JP Morgan prime rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%. The exact spread over LIBOR will depend upon our credit rating by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Service. Interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility is payable at least quarterly.
 
The Credit Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries and contains financial covenants relating to the maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. The Credit Facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants including, among other things, limitations on certain additional indebtedness, guarantees of indebtedness, investments and certain other transactions as defined in the agreement.

Neither the Agent nor the Issuer (which such terms as used in this , shall, in each case, include reference to its Affiliates and its own and its Affiliates' officers, directors, employees and agents) (a) shall have duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Letters of Credit and the other Loan Documents, and shall not by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document be a trustee for any Bank; (b) shall be responsible to any Bank for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties contained in this Agreement, the Letters of Credit or any other Loan Document, or in any certificate or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by any of them under, this Agreement, the Letters of Credit or any other Loan Document, or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, the Letters of Credit or any other Loan Document or any other certificate or document referred to or provided for herein or therein or any property covered thereby or for any failure by any Party or any other Person (other than the Agent or, in the case of a Letter of Credit, Agent and the Issuer of such Letter of Credit) to perform any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder; (c) shall be required to initiate or conduct any litigation or collection proceedings hereunder or under the Letters of Credit or any other Loan Document except to the extent requested by the Majority Banks, and (d) shall be responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it hereunder or under the Letters of Credit or any other Loan Document or any other document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or therein or in connection herewith or therewith, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Agent and the Issuer may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by them with reasonable care. Without in any way limiting any of the foregoing, each Bank acknowledges that neither the Agent nor the Issuer shall have any greater responsibility in the operation of the Letters of Credit than is specified in the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (1993 Revision, International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 500 or any successor publication). In any foreclosure proceeding concerning any collateral for the Notes, each holder of a Note if bidding for its own account or for its own account and the accounts of other Banks is prohibited from including in the amount of its bid an amount to be applied as a credit against its Note or the Notes of the other Banks, instead such holder must bid in cash only. However, in any such foreclosure proceeding, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) submit a bid for all Banks (including itself) in the form of a credit against the Notes of all of the Banks, and the Agent or its designee may (but shall not be obligated to), with the consent of the Majority Banks, accept title to such collateral for and on behalf of all Banks.

The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of the occurrence of a Default (other than the non-payment of principal of or interest on Loans or reimbursements of Letters of Credit Advances) unless it has received notice from a Bank or the Company specifying such Default and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default." In the event that the Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Banks (and shall give each Bank prompt notice of each such non-payment). The Agent shall (subject to hereof) take such action with respect to such Default as shall be directed by the Majority Banks and within its rights under the Loan Documents and at law or in equity, that, unless and until the Agent shall have received such directions, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, permitted hereby with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Banks and within its rights under the Loan Documents, at law or in equity.

Except for notices, reports and other documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by the Agent or the Issuer hereunder, under the Letters of Credit or the other Loan Documents, neither the Agent nor the Issuer shall have any duty or responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of the Company or any other Party (or any of their Affiliates) which may come into the possession of the Agent or the Issuer.

Miscellaneous
 
9.1. . No waiver of any Default shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other Default. No failure to exercise and no delay on the part of the Agent or any Bank in exercising any right or power under any Loan Document or at law or in equity shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or the abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce any such right or power, preclude any further or other exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. No course of dealing between the Company and the Agent or any Bank shall operate as a waiver of any right or power of the Agent or any Bank. No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document nor any consent to any departure therefrom shall be effective unless the same is in writing and signed by the Person against whom it is sought to be enforced, and then it shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.

Governing Law
 
9.4. . All representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by or on behalf of the Company in connection herewith shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, shall not be affected by any investigation made
Survival; Parties Bound
 
by any Person, and shall bind the Company and its successors, trustees, receivers and assigns and inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Agent and the Banks, provided that the undertaking of the Banks hereunder to make Loans to the Company and to issue Letters of Credit for the account of the Company shall not inure to the benefit of any successor or assign of the Company. The term of this Agreement shall be until the final maturity of each Note and the payment of all amounts due under the Loan Documents.
 
9.5. . This Agreement may be executed in several identical counterparts, and by the parties hereto on separate counterparts, and each counterpart, when so executed and delivered, shall constitute an original instrument, and all such separate counterparts shall constitute but one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
 
9.6. . The Company and the Banks intend to strictly comply with all applicable laws, including applicable usury laws. Accordingly, the provisions of this shall govern and control over every other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document which conflicts or is inconsistent with this Section, even if such provision declares that it controls. As used in this Section, the term "interest" includes the aggregate of all charges, fees, benefits or other compensation which constitute interest under applicable law, that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) any non-principal payment shall be characterized as an expense or as compensation for something other than the use, forbearance or detention of money and not as interest, and (b) all interest at any time contracted for, reserved, charged or received shall be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread, in equal parts during the full term of the Loans and the Commitments. In no event shall the Company or any other Person be obligated to pay, or the Agent or any Bank have any right or privilege to reserve, receive or retain, (Y) any interest in excess of the maximum amount of nonusurious interest permitted under the laws of the State of Texas or the applicable laws (if any) of the United States or of any other state, or (Z) total interest in excess of the amount which the Agent or such Bank could lawfully have contracted for, reserved, received, retained or charged had the interest been calculated for the full term of the Loans at the Highest Lawful Rate. On each day, if any, that the Stated Rate or such other rate, respectively, or any rate called for under any other Loan Document exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the rate at which interest shall accrue shall automatically be fixed by operation of this sentence at the Highest Lawful Rate for that day, and shall remain fixed at the Highest Lawful Rate for each day thereafter until the total amount of interest accrued equals the total amount of interest which would have accrued if there were no such ceiling rate as is imposed by this sentence. Thereafter, interest shall accrue at the Stated Rate or such other rate, respectively, unless and until the Stated Rate or such other rate again exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate when the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall again automatically operate to limit the interest accrual rate. The daily interest rates to be used in calculating interest at the Highest Lawful Rate shall be determined by dividing the applicable Highest Lawful Rate per annum by the number of days in the calendar year for which such calculation is being made. None of the terms and provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document which directly or indirectly relate to interest shall ever be construed without reference to this , or be construed to create a contract to pay for the use, forbearance or detention of money at an interest rate in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate. If the term of any Loans or the Notes is shortened by reason of acceleration of maturity as a result of any Default or by any other cause, or by reason of any required or permitted prepayment, and if

provided
Section 9.6
 
for that (or any other) reason any Bank at any time, including the stated maturity, is owed or receives (and/or has received) interest in excess of interest calculated at the Highest Lawful Rate, then and in any such event all of any such excess interest shall be canceled automatically as of the date of such acceleration, prepayment or other event which produces the excess, and, if such excess interest has been paid to such Bank, it shall be credited against the then-outstanding principal balance of the Company's obligations to the Agent or such Bank, effective as of the date or dates when the event occurs which causes it to be excess interest, until such excess is exhausted or all of such principal has been fully paid and satisfied, whichever occurs first, and any remaining balance of such excess shall be promptly refunded to its payor.
