(NASDAQ: WFMI) today reported sales and earnings for the 12-week quarter ended July 2, 2006.

For the 40-week period ended July 2, 2006, sales increased 20% to $4.3 billion driven by 14% weighted average square footage growth and comparable store sales growth of 11.7%. Sales in identical stores (excluding four relocated stores and one major expansion) increased 10.9%. Net income increased 29% to $164.0 million, diluted earnings per share increased 21% to $1.13, operating cash flow per share was $2.35, and Economic Value Added (EVA) improved $28.5 million to $56.1 million.

"We are very pleased to report 9.9% comparable store sales growth for the quarter given our tough 15.2% comparison in the prior year. This translates to a 25.1% two-year comp in the third quarter, the highest we have produced this year," said John Mackey, chairman, chief executive officer, and co-founder of Whole Foods Market. "We continue to expect comparable store sales growth for the full year of 10% to 12% which will mark our third year of double-digit comp sales growth." - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Whole Foods Market, Inc. 550 Bowie Street Austin, Texas 78703 512.477.5566 fax 512.482.7204 http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com
The following table breaks out additional information on the quarter for comparable stores and all stores, highlighting the Company's strong performance throughout its store base. * Includes pre-opening expense Gross profit consists of sales less cost of goods sold and occupancy costs plus the contribution from non-retail distribution and food preparation operations.

For stores in the comparable store base, direct store expenses improved 54 basis points to 24.6% of sales. G&A expenses improved 21 basis points to 3.3% of sales. The following table shows the Company's year-to-date results for certain line items as a percentage of sales compared to its historical five-year ranges and average results, highlighting that these results have been very consistent on an annualized basis over time. Pre-opening and relocation costs were $7.9 million of which approximately $5.1 million was pre-opening rent and approximately $1.6 million was accelerated depreciation related to relocations.

During the quarter, the Company produced $125 million in cash flow from operations, received $41 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and paid approximately $21 million to shareholders in cash dividends. Year to date, the Company has produced $342 million in cash flow from operations, received $209 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and paid approximately $337 million to shareholders in cash dividends. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $74 million of which $45 million was for new stores and $29 million was for remodels and other. Capital expenditures year to date have totaled $198 million of which $111 million was for new stores and $86 million was for remodels and other. During the quarter, the Company retired its senior notes making the final $5.7 million principal payment in May. The Company's total cash and investments were approximately $397 million at the end of the quarter, and total long-term debt consisting primarily of zero coupon convertible debentures was approximately $9 million. At July 2, 2006, the Company had investments in short-term variable rate demand obligations (VRDOs) totaling approximately $274 million included in "short-term investments - available-for-sale securities" on the accompanying balance sheet. These investments are generally tax-free municipal obligations with contractual maturities of less than 90 days. Historically, most companies have classified investments in VRDOs as cash equivalents due to their liquidity. Based on information about a recent clarification of the preferred balance sheet classification of VRDOs, the Company has elected to classify its VRDO investments in "short-term investments". NEW STORE DEVELOPMENT In the third quarter, the Company opened one new store in Greenville, SC and closed a 2,600 square foot Fresh & Wild store in the U.K. In the fourth quarter, the Company plans to open four stores averaging 58,000 square feet in size, one of which is a relocation. Three of these stores are expected to open at the end of the quarter. The Company continues to add to its store development pipeline with the recent signing of eight new store leases averaging 55,000 square feet in size which are as follows: Dublin, CA; Oxnard, CA; Los Angeles, CA; Denver, CO; Connecticut; Florida; Schaumburg, IL; and New Jersey. In addition, the Company has signed a lease to expand its store in Boulder, CO from 39,000 square feet to 74,000 square feet. The following table provides additional information about the Company's new store openings over the last four quarters, leases currently tendered, and store development pipeline for stores scheduled to open through fiscal year 2009. *Includes leases tendered GROWTH GOALS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2006 For fiscal year 2006, the Company expects sales growth in the range of 18% to 21%, comparable store sales growth of 10% to 12%, and weighted average square footage growth in line with its 14% historical average. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Whole Foods Market, Inc. 550 Bowie Street Austin, Texas 78703 512.477.5566 fax 512.482.7204 http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com -3-
The Company expects non-cash share-based compensation expense of approximately $2 million to $3 million and pre-opening and relocation costs of approximately $13 to $15 million in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be in the range of $310 million to $330 million. Based on the Company's better-than-expected year-to-date diluted earnings per share of $1.13, the Company now expects diluted earnings per share growth in fiscal year 2006 to be in line with or slightly higher than sales growth. As previously stated, this guidance excludes the $16.5 million in costs relating to Hurricane Katrina in fiscal year 2005, share-based compensation expense in fiscal years 2005 and 2006, and uses a 40% tax rate in both years. GROWTH GOALS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2007 AND BEYOND The Company notes that fiscal year 2007 will be a 53-week year, with the fifty-third week occurring in the fourth quarter. For fiscal year 2007, on a 52-week to 52-week basis, the Company expects total sales growth of 15% to 20%. The Company expects growth in operating income before pre-opening and relocation costs to be in line with sales growth. Ten of the Company's 14 tendered stores, representing approximately 520,000 square feet, are expected to open in fiscal year 2007. This 520,000 square feet is equal to roughly 78% of the square footage expected to open in all of fiscal year 2006, and the Company expects to announce additional stores tendered for openings in 2007 over the next two quarters. The anticipated acceleration in leases tendered and square footage opening in 2007 is expected to result in materially higher pre-opening and relocation expense year over year which, in turn, is expected to impact the Company's diluted earnings per share growth. Longer term, the Company's goal is to reach $12 billion in sales in 2010.
