ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT On September 26, 2006, we entered into a 7 year distribution agreement with United Natural Foods, Inc. ("UNFI"), pursuant to which UNFI will continue to act as our primary wholesale natural grocery distributor in our regions where UNFI currently holds that status. The agreement, effective on September 26, 2006, replaces an existing three year primary distribution agreement that was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2007. The agreement relates to all products purchased by Whole Foods Market from UNFI (excluding Albert's Organics, Inc. and UNFI manufacturing arms and retail divisions) and generally extends our current arrangement with UNFI through September 29, 2013. The agreement requires eight of our eleven regions to continue to purchase a minimum dollar amount of product, which relates to prior year purchases from UNFI; and specifies that collectively the U.S. grocery stores in nine of our regions, where UNFI is currently the primary distributor, are required to purchase from UNFI a dollar majority of those products purchased from all wholesale natural grocery distributors.
SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
