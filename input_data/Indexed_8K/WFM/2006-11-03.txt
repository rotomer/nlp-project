Exhibit 99.1 WHOLE FOODS MARKET REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS; NON-GAAP DILUTED EPS INCREASE TO $0.29; COMPANY REPURCHASES $100 MILLION OF STOCK IN QUARTER, RAISES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND 20% TO $0.18 PER SHARE, AND REVISES FISCAL YEAR 2007 GUIDANCE AUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Whole Foods Market, Inc. (Nasdaq: WFMI) today reported sales and earnings for the 12-week quarter ended September 24, 2006. For the quarter, sales increased 16% to $1.3 billion. Comparable store sales increased 8.6% on top of a 13.4% increase in the prior year. Identical store sales (excluding two relocated stores and one major expansion) increased 8.4%. In September 2005, the Company recorded a $17.4 million pre-tax non-cash share-based compensation charge related to the accelerated vesting of outstanding stock options based on historical team member turnover rates and the Company's best estimate of future turnover rates. To adjust this estimate for actual experience, the Company recorded an additional $3.0 million pre-tax non-cash share-based compensation charge in the fourth quarter this year. The Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations on a Non-GAAP Basis (hereinafter referred to as adjusted results) exclude these charges, as well as $16.5 million in pre-tax Hurricane Katrina costs in the fourth quarter last year and $7.2 million in pre-tax credits for insurance proceeds and other adjustments related to Hurricane Katrina in the first three quarters this year. For the quarter, adjusted net income increased to $42.2 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased to $0.29. Economic Value Added (EVA) improved $10.2 million to $8.3 million, and operating cash flow per share was $0.79. For the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2006, sales increased 19% to $5.6 billion. Comparable store sales grew 11.0% on top of a 12.8% increase in the prior year. Identical store sales (excluding five relocated stores and one major expansion) increased 10.3%. Year over year, the Company reported a 10% increase in ending square footage and a 14% increase in weighted average square footage, reflecting the Company's front-end loaded new store openings. Adjusted net income increased to $201.8 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased to $1.39. Economic Value Added (EVA) improved $38.6 million to $64.4 million, and operating cash flow per share was $3.12. "In fiscal 2006, we produced strong operating results, reporting our third consecutive year of double-digit comparable store sales growth, an increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share to $1.39, and a $39 million improvement in EVA," said John Mackey, chairman, chief executive officer, and co-founder of Whole Foods Market. "We returned $358 million in cash dividends to our shareholders and are pleased to announce today a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.18 per share." During the quarter, the Company produced $114 million in cash flow from operations and received $13 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $142 million of which $97 million was for new stores. The Company paid approximately $21 million to shareholders in cash dividends and repurchased approximately two million shares, or $100 million, of common stock on the open market. For the fiscal year, the Company produced $453 million in cash flow from operations and received $222 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Capital expenditures for the fiscal year totaled $340 million of which $209 million was for new stores. The Company paid approximately $358 million to shareholders in cash dividends and repurchased approximately two million shares, or $100 million, of common stock on the open market. The Company finished the year with total cash and investments of approximately $256 million and total long-term debt of approximately $9 million. The Company today announced that its Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.18 per share payable on January 22, 2007 to shareholders of record as of January 12, 2007. This is an increase of 20% from the Company's previous $0.15 quarterly dividend and is the fourth increase since the Company declared its first cash dividend of $0.075 on a split-adjusted basis in November 2003. The following table highlights the Company's fiscal year 2006 growth in sales, comparable store sales, and square footage relative to its historical five-year ranges and averages. Historical and Current Performance Low High Average FY06 - -------------------------------------- ------- ------- ------- ------- Sales growth 17.0% 22.8% 20.7% 19.3% Comparable store sales growth 8.6% 14.9% 11.1% 11.0% Two-year comps (sum of two years) 17.8% 27.8% 21.4% 23.8% Weighted average square footage growth 9% 17% 14% 14%
The following table breaks out additional information on the quarter for comparable stores and all stores, highlighting the Company's strong performance throughout its store base.

For the fourth quarter, adjusted gross profit decreased 43 basis points to 34.8% of sales. For stores in the comparable store base, adjusted gross profit decreased eight basis points to 35.2% of sales. These results include a LIFO credit of $0.6 million this quarter versus a $2.2 million credit in the fourth quarter last year, a negative impact of 15 basis points year over year. Adjusted direct store expenses improved 42 basis points to 25.5% of sales. For stores in the comparable store base, adjusted direct store expenses improved 70 basis points to 25.2% of sales. Adjusted G&A expenses improved seven basis points to 3.2% of sales. The following table shows the Company's adjusted fiscal year 2006 results for certain line items as a percentage of sales compared to its historical five-year ranges and averages, highlighting the consistency of these results on an annualized basis over time. Historical and Current Performance Low High Average FY06 - -------------------------------------- ------- ------- ------- ------- Gross profit 34.2% 35.1% 34.7% 34.9% Direct store expenses 25.2% 25.5% 25.4% 25.4% G&A 3.1% 3.6% 3.3% 3.2% Pre-opening and relocation costs were $13.7 million in the fourth quarter. Of the $13.7 million, approximately $1.8 million was accelerated depreciation related to relocations and approximately $5.9 million was pre-opening rent, both of which were expensed for accounting purposes but were primarily non-cash. New Store Development In the fourth quarter, the Company opened three new stores in Los Altos, CA; Redmond, WA; and Milwaukee, WI and relocated one store in Atlanta, GA. Three of these stores opened at the end of the quarter. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, the Company has opened two stores in West Orange, NJ and Tigard, OR and plans to open a store in Seattle, WA next week and relocate a store in Dallas, TX in early December. The Company has recently signed eight new store leases averaging 57,000 square feet in size which are as follows: San Jose, CA; Boise, ID; Kildeer, IL; Indianapolis, IN; Nashua, NH; Cary, NC; Dallas, TX; and Salt Lake City, UT.
The following table provides additional information about the Company's store openings in fiscal year 2006 and thus far in fiscal year 2007, leases currently tendered but not opened, and total development pipeline for stores scheduled to open through fiscal year 2010. For accounting purposes, a store is tendered on the date the Company has access to the site for construction and other purposes.

For fiscal year 2007, on a 52-week to 52-week basis, the Company now expects total sales growth of 13% to 17%. The Company has produced three consecutive years of double-digit comparable stores sales growth. In fiscal year 2006, the Company produced 11.0% comparable stores sales growth, ranging from 13.0% in the first quarter to 8.6% in the fourth quarter. For the first five weeks of fiscal year 2007 ended October 29, 2006, comparable store sales increased 6.8% on top of a 13.6% increase in the prior year. Based on recent results, current sales trends and the continuing difficult comparisons, particularly in the first half of the year, the Company expects comparable store sales growth of 6% to 8% for fiscal year 2007. "After producing such strong growth over the last three years, we believe fiscal 2007 will be a transition year for us. As we revert back to our historical comparable store sales growth range, without yet producing a fully offsetting increase in sales from new stores, we believe our total sales growth will be impacted," said Mr. Mackey. "However, having opened six new stores over the last two months, we believe we are just beginning to execute on delivering an acceleration in store openings that will be a driver of strong sales and comps in the not-so-distant future. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our goal of reaching $12 billion in sales in fiscal 2010." Thus far in fiscal year 2007, the Company has opened two stores representing approximately 108,000 square feet, and all of the Company's 13 currently tendered stores, representing approximately 691,000 square feet, are expected to open this fiscal year. In addition, the Company expects to announce five additional stores tendered for openings in fiscal year 2007 with its first quarter results in mid-February, translating to an estimated year-over-year increase in ending square footage of approximately 16%. On a 52-week basis compared to adjusted fiscal year 2006 results, the Company expects growth in operating income before pre-opening and relocation costs to be in line with or slightly lower than sales growth.
The Company expects total pre-opening and relocation costs for fiscal year 2007 to be in the range of $68 million to $74 million. This significant year-over-year increase is due primarily to the anticipated acceleration in leases tendered and square footage opening in fiscal years 2007 and 2008, including the opening of 18 to 20 new stores this fiscal year of which up to five will be relocations. Approximately $18 million to $24 million relates to stores expected to open in fiscal year 2008. These ranges are based on estimated tender dates which are subject to change. The Company expects significantly higher-than-average pre-opening expense in fiscal year 2007 of approximately $7 million related to its first Whole Foods Market store in London. Excluding this store, the Company expects total pre-opening and relocation expense for stores opening in fiscal year 2007 to average approximately $2.4 million per store, above the Company's average for stores that opened in fiscal year 2006 due primarily to higher accelerated depreciation related to relocations. On an average weekly basis, the Company expects quarterly pre-opening and relocation expense to be fairly even throughout the fiscal year. The Company expects share-based compensation of approximately $2 million to $3 million per quarter in the first half of the year and $3 million to $4 million per quarter in the second half of the year following the Company's annual grant date early in the third quarter, when the majority of options are granted. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $525 million to $575 million. Of this amount, approximately 70% to 75% is related to new stores opening in fiscal year 2007 and beyond. The Company expects its materially higher pre-opening and relocation costs resulting primarily from the anticipated acceleration in leases tendered and square footage opening in fiscal years 2007 and 2008 to significantly impact fiscal year 2007 diluted earnings per share growth. Longer term, the Company's goal is to reach $12 billion in sales in fiscal year 2010. Non-GAAP Measures: In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, GAAP, the Company provides non-GAAP operating results that exclude certain charges or credits and information regarding Economic Value Added ("EVA"). These amounts are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. The Company's management believes that these presentations provide useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its results of operations and financial condition and to help enable comparability between current and prior periods. In addition, management uses non-GAAP EVA measures for reviewing the financial results of the Company and for incentive compensation and capital planning purposes. In this press release, the Company has presented its results for the twelve and fifty-two week periods ended September 24, 2006 and September 25, 2005 on a GAAP and Non-GAAP basis with a line item reconciliation. Also in this press release, is a tabular reconciliation of EVA to GAAP net income, which the Company believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Exhibit 99.2 WHOLE FOODS MARKET ANNOUNCES CHANGES IN SALARY CAP AND CEO COMPENSATION AUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Whole Foods Market, Inc. (Nasdaq: WFMI) today announced that its Board of Directors approved an increase in the Company's salary cap for 2006 and future years from 14 times to 19 times the average pay of all full-time team members employed during the applicable year. For 2006, this means the salary cap will be approximately $608,000. The salary cap is a limit on total cash compensation paid to any team member in any calendar year. Employee benefits, stock options and non-cash 401(k) contributions are not counted in determining and applying the salary cap. The following is the salary cap calculation for the Company's past eight years: Average Annual Average Salary Year Hourly Wage Wage Multiple Cap ------------ ------------ --------- --------- --------- 1999 $ 12.36 $ 25,709 10 $ 257,000 2000 $ 12.84 $ 26,707 14 $ 373,900 2001 $ 13.46 $ 27,997 14 $ 391,900 2002 $ 13.69 $ 28,479 14 $ 398,700 2003 $ 14.07 $ 29,266 14 $ 409,700 2004 $ 14.66 $ 30,493 14 $ 426,900 2005 $ 15.00 $ 31,200 14 $ 436,800 2006 $ 15.38 $ 31,990 19 $ 607,800 This is the third time the Company has increased its salary cap since the cap was created 20 years ago. Originally set at eight times the average pay, the cap was raised to 10 times the average pay in the early 1990s and to 14 times the average pay in 2000. "We are raising the salary cap for one reason -- to make the compensation of our key executives more competitive in the marketplace and help ensure their retention," said John Mackey, chairman, chief executive officer, and co-founder of Whole Foods Market. Additionally, the Company announced that John Mackey will reduce his salary to $1 beginning January 1, 2007 and forgo any future stock option awards. Mr. Mackey will continue to receive the same benefits that all team members receive, including the food discount card and health insurance. "I continue to work for Whole Foods not because of the money I can make but because of the pleasure I get from leading such a great company, and the ongoing passion I have to help make the world a better place, which Whole Foods is continuing to do," said Mr. Mackey. "I am now 53 years old, and I have reached a place in my life where I no longer want to work for money, but simply for the joy of the work itself and to better answer the call to service that I feel so clearly in my own heart." "In view of John's decision to forgo future additional cash compensation, the Board of Directors has decided that Whole Foods Market will contribute $100,000 annually to a new Global Team Member Emergency Fund, which will be distributed to team members as needed when disasters occur," said Dr. John Elstrott, lead director of Whole Foods Market. "The Board also intends to donate all stock options Mr. Mackey would have been eligible to receive in the future to Whole Foods Market's two foundations -- The Whole Planet Foundation and The Animal Compassion Foundation -- in honor of John's commitment to those causes."
Approximately 93% of the options granted under Whole Foods Market's 1992 Incentive Stock Option Plan have been granted to team members who are not executive officers.
