ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS. On February 21, 2007, we entered into a merger agreement with Wild Oats Markets, Inc. ("Wild Oats"), pursuant to which we, through our subsidiary have commenced an offer (the "Offer") to purchase all the outstanding shares of Wild Oats at a purchase price of $18.50 per share in cash. We have previously disclosed that consummation of the Offer is subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of any waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended ("HSR Act"). On March 13, 2007, we and Wild Oats received a request for additional information (commonly known as a "second request") from the Federal Trade Commission in connection with the Offer. Whole Foods Market and Wild Oats intend to respond promptly to the second request. The effect of the second request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the HSR Act until 10 days after we have substantially complied with the request, unless that period is extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated sooner by the FTC. 2
