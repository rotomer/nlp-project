Whole Foods Market Announces Extension to Tender Offer AUSTIN, Texas, May 22 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Whole Foods Market, Inc. (Nasdaq: WFMI) announced today that it had extended the expiration date for its tender offer to purchase outstanding shares of Wild Oats Markets, Inc. to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Wednesday, June 20, 2007 On February 21, 2007, the Company and Wild Oats Markets announced they signed a definitive merger agreement under which the Company would acquire Wild Oats Markets' outstanding common stock in a cash tender offer at a price of $18.50 per share, or approximately $565 million based on fully diluted shares. The Company will also assume Wild Oats Markets' existing net debt, which totaled approximately $106 million on September 30, 2006. The Company expects to fund the transaction at closing using $700 million in new senior term loan facilities. Additionally, in conjunction with the transaction, the Company intends to expand its existing long-term senior revolving credit facility to $250 million. The Company agreed in the merger agreement to commence a tender offer on February 27, 2007 for all of Wild Oats Markets' outstanding common stock. The tender offer is conditioned upon at least a majority of the outstanding Wild Oats Markets' shares being tendered, as well as customary regulatory and other closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of any waiting period under the Federal Trade Commission's ("FTC") Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended ("HSR Act"). Wild Oats Markets' board of directors has unanimously recommended that Wild Oats Markets' stockholders tender their shares in the offer. The Yucaipa Companies, Wild Oats Markets' largest shareholder with approximately 18% ownership, has committed to tendering its shares. The Company is currently working diligently with the FTC regarding the HSR Act review. On March 13, 2007, the Company and Wild Oats Markets, Inc. received a second request for additional information from the FTC in connection with the Company's proposed tender offer. On March 21, 2007, the Company announced that it extended the expiration date for its tender offer to purchase outstanding shares of Wild Oats Markets, Inc. to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on Tuesday, April 24, 2007. On April 24, 2007, the Company announced that it again extended the expiration date for its tender offer to purchase outstanding shares of Wild Oats Markets, Inc. to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on Tuesday, May 22, 2007. Today the Company is announcing that it has extended the expiration date for its tender offer to purchase outstanding shares of Wild Oats Markets, Inc. to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Wednesday, June 20, 2007. The extended tender offer is subject to additional extensions and to the receipt of customary regulatory approvals, including the expiration or termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act. Although the FTC has not yet decided whether to challenge the Wild Oats transaction, members of the FTC staff have voiced concerns regarding perceived anticompetitive effects resulting from the proposed tender offer and merger. Approval of the transaction by Whole Foods Market shareholders is not required.
