Whole Foods Market Reports Third Quarter Results Company Reports Comparable Store Sales Increase of 7.0% on Top of 9.9% Increase in Prior Year and Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.35; Company Repurchases $100 Million of Stock and Pays $25 million in Cash Dividends in Quarter; 18 New Stores Opened over Last Twelve Months AUSTIN, Texas, July 31 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Whole Foods Market, Inc. (Nasdaq: WFMI) today reported sales and earnings for the 12-week quarter ended July 1, 2007. Sales increased 13.2% to $1.5 billion driven by 14% ending square footage growth and a 7.0% increase in comparable store sales on top of a 9.9% increase in the prior year. The negative impact on comparable store sales growth of Easter shifting from the third quarter last year to the second quarter this year was approximately 76 basis points in the quarter. Identical store sales (excluding four relocated stores and two major expansions) increased 5.8%. Net income was $49.1 million, diluted earnings per share were $0.35, operating cash flow per share was $0.87, and Economic Value Added (EVA(TM)) was $15.6 million. For the quarter, pre-opening and relocation costs were $15.0 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, compared to $7.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the third quarter last year. Approximately $8.6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, relating to share-based compensation, pre-opening rent and accelerated depreciation was expensed for accounting purposes but was non-cash, compared to $6.3 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the prior year. During the quarter, the Company produced $123 million in cash flow from operations and received $4 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $128 million of which $95 million was for new stores. The Company paid approximately $25 million to shareholders in cash dividends and repurchased approximately $100 million of common stock. The Company's remaining authorization for share repurchases is currently $100 million. At the end of the quarter, the Company had total cash and investments of approximately $35 million and total long-term debt of approximately $3 million. The Company also expanded its existing $100 million revolving credit line to $200 million during the quarter. "As expected, fiscal year 2007 has been an investment year as we have accelerated our new store openings while cycling over tough year-ago comparable store sales growth comparisons. We believe that our third quarter results, combined with our 7.6% comparable store sales increase in the fourth quarter to date, is an indication that our comparable store sales growth has stabilized," said John Mackey, chairman, chief executive officer, and co-founder of Whole Foods Market. "We are on track to deliver 18 to 20 new store openings this year. We expect to open a greater number of stores in fiscal year 2008, but currently do not expect the same degree of year-over-year increase in our total pre-opening expenses. We are very excited to see the acceleration in our new store openings materialize, as we expect these new stores to drive strong sales and comparable store sales growth in the not-so-distant future." For the 40-week period ended July 1, 2007, sales increased 12.3% to $4.8 billion driven by 14% ending square footage growth and comparable store sales growth of 6.7% on top of an 11.7% increase in the prior year. Sales in identical stores (excluding five relocated stores and three major expansions) increased 5.7%. Net income was $148.8 million, diluted earnings per share were $1.05, operating cash flow per share was $2.12, and EVA was $38.2 million. Year to date, pre-opening and relocation costs were $46.9 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $23.7 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in the prior year. Approximately $25.2 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, relating to share-based compensation, pre-opening rent and accelerated depreciation was expensed for accounting purposes but was non-cash, compared to $14.6 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the prior year.
The Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations on a Non-GAAP Basis (hereinafter referred to as adjusted results) exclude pre-tax credits for insurance proceeds and other adjustments related to Hurricane Katrina of $3.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006 and $7.2 million in the 40-week period ended July 2, 2006. Excluding these credits, adjusted earnings per share were $0.35 in the third quarter last year and $1.10 for the 40-week period ended July 2, 2006. The following table shows the Company's growth in sales, comparable store sales, and ending square footage year to date compared to its historical five-year ranges and average results. For fiscal year 2007, the Company has guided to sales growth of 13% to 17%, comparable store sales growth of 6% to 8%, and ending square footage growth of 16%. Five-Year FY Range Five-Year YTD Low High FY Average FY07 Sales growth 17.0% 22.8% 20.3% 12.3% Comparable store sales growth 8.6% 14.9% 11.5% 6.7% Two-year comps (sum of two years) 18.6% 27.8% 22.7% 18.4% Ending square footage growth 10% 14% 12% 14% The following table breaks out additional information on the quarter for comparable stores and all stores. NOPAT # of Average Total Comparable Stores Comps ROIC Stores Size Square Feet Over 11 years old 4.1% 91% 59 27,600 1,626,200 Between eight and 11 years old 3.7% 68% 26 31,100 807,600 Between five and eight years old 6.1% 44% 43 34,700 1,492,400 Between two and five years old 8.3% 29% 37 40,300 1,491,600 Less than two years old (includes four relocations) 22.6% 1%* 18 54,400 979,500 All comparable stores (7.5 years old, s.f weighted) 7.0% 40%* 183 35,000 6,406,300 All stores (6.8 years old, s.f. weighted) 33%* 196 36,200 7,104,800 * Includes pre-opening expense for stores less than two years old. Excluding the Kensington relocation, NOPAT ROIC was 10%, 43% and 35% for comparable stores less than two years old, all comparable stores, and all stores, respectively. Note that due to certain operational changes, some expenses previously included in cost of goods sold are now included in direct store expenses, representing an estimated impact of approximately 16 basis points on those line items in the quarter. For comparable stores, the following year-over-year basis point changes in gross profit and direct store expenses as a percentage of sales adjust for this impact.
Gross profit consists of sales less cost of goods sold and occupancy costs plus the contribution from non-retail distribution and food preparation operations. For the third quarter, gross profit increased 36 basis points to 35.5% of sales from an adjusted 35.2% of sales last year, which excludes approximately $0.9 million in credits related to Hurricane Katrina. The LIFO charge was $2.1 million in the quarter compared to $0.8 million in the prior year. For stores in the comparable store base, gross profit improved 42 basis points to 35.7% of sales. Historically, the Company's average weekly sales and gross margins are strongest in the second and third quarters. For the quarter, direct store expenses increased 90 basis points to 26.1% of sales from an adjusted 25.2% of sales last year, which excludes approximately $1.2 million in credits related to Hurricane Katrina. For stores in the comparable store base, direct store expenses increased 23 basis points to 25.4% of sales due primarily to increases in health care and share-based compensation expense, which were partially offset by leverage in wages as a percentage of sales. Share-based compensation expense included in direct store expenses was approximately $2.3 million in the quarter compared to approximately $0.5 million in the prior year. Store contribution decreased 54 basis points to 9.5% of sales from an adjusted 10.0% of sales last year, which excludes approximately $2.0 million in credits related to Hurricane Katrina. For stores in the comparable store base, store contribution increased 19 basis points to 10.3% of sales. G&A expenses improved five basis points to 3.2% of sales. Share-based compensation expense included in G&A was approximately $1.6 million compared to approximately $0.9 million in the prior year. The following table shows the Company's year-to-date results for certain line items as a percentage of sales compared to its historical five-year ranges and averages, highlighting the consistency of these results on an annualized basis over time. Where applicable, historical percentages have been adjusted to exclude Hurricane Katrina charges and credits, as well as share-based compensation expense related to the Company's September 2005 accelerated vesting of stock options. Five-Year FY Range Five-Year FY YTD Low High Average FY07 Gross profit 34.2% 35.1% 34.8% 34.9% Direct store expenses 25.2% 25.5% 25.4% 25.9% Store contribution 9.0% 9.6% 9.4% 9.0% G&A 3.1% 3.6% 3.2% 3.1% For the quarter, pre-opening and relocation costs were $15.0 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, of which approximately $4.4 million was pre-opening rent and accelerated depreciation that was expensed for accounting purposes but was non-cash. In the prior year, pre-opening and relocation costs were $7.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of which approximately $5.4 million was non-cash pre-opening rent and accelerated depreciation. New Store Development In the third quarter, the Company opened one store in El Segundo, CA, one store in Sonoma, CA, and relocated its Notting Hill Fresh & Wild store in London to its new Kensington Whole Foods Market location. Thus far in the fourth quarter, the Company has opened one store in Chicago, IL and expects to open four to six additional stores during the quarter, two of which are relocations. As of today, the Company has opened 18 new stores over the last 12 months. The Company has recently signed seven new store leases averaging 39,000 square feet in size which are as follows: Malibu, CA; San Francisco, CA; Toronto, Canada; Kailua, HI; Maui, HI; Lynnfield, MA; and Rochester Hills, MI.
Since its second quarter earnings release on May 9, the Company has opened three new stores, and 10 leases have been tendered. For accounting purposes, a store is considered tendered on the date the Company takes possession of the space for construction and other purposes, which is typically when the shell of the store is complete or nearing completion. The average tender period, or length of time between tender date and opening date, will vary depending on several factors, one of which is the number of acquired leases, ground leases and owned properties in development, all of which generally have longer tender periods than standard operating leases. The following table provides additional information about the Company's store openings in fiscal year 2006 and thus far in fiscal year 2007, leases currently tendered but not opened, and total development pipeline for stores scheduled to open through fiscal year 2010. Of the Company's 25 stores currently tendered, 23 are expected to open between now and the end of fiscal year 2008, and the Company expects to announce additional stores over the next two quarters tendered for openings in fiscal year 2008. (1) Includes leases tendered (2) Pre-opening and development costs are estimated for stores opened YTD and exclude Kensington in London
Growth Goals for Fiscal Year 2007 and Beyond The Company's guidance for fiscal year 2007 excludes any impact from the proposed merger with Wild Oats Markets, as the transaction has not closed. The Company notes that fiscal year 2007 is a 53-week year, with the extra week falling in the fourth quarter making it a thirteen-week quarter. For fiscal year 2007, on a 52-week to 52-week basis, the Company expects total sales growth of 13% to 17% and comparable store sales growth of 6% to 8%. Year to date, the Company has opened 14 stores and expanded two stores representing approximately 781,000 square feet net of closures related to three relocations. In addition to one store already open in the fourth quarter, four to six of the Company's 25 currently tendered stores, representing up to approximately 278,000 square feet net of closures, are expected to open in the fourth quarter, translating to an estimated year-over-year increase in ending square footage of approximately 16%. For fiscal year 2007, the Company expects operating income before pre-opening and relocation costs as a percentage of sales to be in line with its 5.9% results year to date. The Company expects share-based compensation, a non-cash expense, of approximately $3 million to $4 million in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2007 are expected to be in the range of $525 million to $575 million. Of this amount, approximately 70% to 75% is related to new stores opening in fiscal year 2007 and beyond. The Company has incurred materially higher pre-opening and relocation costs of approximately $47 million year to date compared to approximately $24 million for the same period last year resulting primarily from the acceleration in square footage opening in fiscal years 2007 and 2008. As expected, these costs have had a significant negative impact on fiscal year 2007 diluted earnings per share growth. For the fourth quarter, the Company expects pre-opening and relocation costs in the range of $20 million to $24 million. Fiscal year 2007 results are expected to include approximately $33 million to $36 million, or approximately $0.14 or $0.15 per share, of non-cash pre-opening rent, accelerated depreciation, and share-based compensation expense. Longer term, the Company's goal is to reach $12 billion in sales in fiscal year 2010.
Proposed Merger with Wild Oats Markets The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia preliminary injunction hearing to decide whether to approve the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) application for an injunction to block the proposed merger between Whole Foods Market and Wild Oats Markets began today and is scheduled to conclude on August 1, 2007. The Company expects to receive a ruling by the middle of August. The Company announced on June 20, 2007 that, subject to prevailing in its current lawsuit with the FTC concerning the proposed merger, the Company plans to transfer all 35 Henry's and Sun Harvest store locations, plus a Riverside, CA distribution center, to a wholly owned subsidiary of Smart & Final, Inc., a Los Angeles-based food retailer. "We are hopeful that the court will rule in our favor and that we will be allowed to move forward; however, we believe that merger or no merger, Whole Foods Market has a very bright future," said Mr. Mackey. "We currently have 94 stores in our pipeline representing 70 percent of our existing square footage, and we believe we are on track to meet our goal of $12 billion in sales in 2010. If the merger is approved, just as we have done with our many previous acquisitions, we will improve the Wild Oats stores to make them more profitable and create an improved shopping experience for our customers."
