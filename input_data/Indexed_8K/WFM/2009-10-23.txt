Item 3.03       Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders.
 
On October 23, 2009, Whole Foods Market, Inc. announced its intention to call all 425,000 outstanding shares of its Series A 8.00% Redeemable Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock for redemption in accordance with the terms governing such Series A Preferred Stock.  Subject to conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock by its holders as discussed below, the Company will redeem such Series A Preferred Stock on November 27, 2009 at a price per share equal to $1,000 plus accrued and unpaid dividends.
 
On the Redemption Date, the Redemption Payment will become due and payable on the Series A Preferred Stock outstanding and dividends on this Series A Preferred Stock will cease to accrue. At any time prior to the Redemption Date, the Series A Preferred Stock may be converted by the holders thereof.  If the holders were to convert on November 25, 2009 (the last business date prior to the Redemption Date), including the accrued and unpaid dividends they would receive approximately 29.662 million shares of common stock of the Company.  Based on the conversion rate for the Series A Preferred Stock into the Company's common stock and the current trading prices of the Company's common stock, the Company anticipates conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock by its holders prior to the Redemption Date.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
