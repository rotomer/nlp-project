Amendments to the Registrant's Code of Ethics, or Waiver of a Provision of the Code of Ethics
 
(a)
          
On December 8, 2009, our board of directors amended the section of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that deals with potential conflicts of interest arising from the financial interests of our team members or directors in Company vendors.  The amendment revises the thresholds for which a conflict of interest is presumed.  The amendment also creates a requirement that our Nominating and Governance Committee review certain potential conflicts of interest involving our directors and leadership members, and third parties that received from, or paid to, Whole Foods Market more than $120,000 in any one of the prior three years.
 
A copy of our Code of Conduct and Ethics, as so amended, is publicly available on our Company website at http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/company/pdfs/codeofconduct.pdf.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
