On August 3, 2010, the Company issued a press release announcing its results of operations for its third fiscal quarter ended July 4, 2010. A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, the Company provides information regarding Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Adjusted EBITDA and Free cash flow in the press release as additional information about its operating results.  These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. The Companys management believes that these presentations provide useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its results of operations and financial condition. In addition, management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of the Company as well as a component of incentive compensation. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus non-cash asset impairment charges. The Company defines Free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.  The press release includes a tabular reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP net income, which the Company believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
The information contained in this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, is being furnished and shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section.  Furthermore, the information contained in this Item 2.02 or Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
August 3, 2010.  Whole Foods Market, Inc. (NASDAQ: WFMI) today reported results for the 12-week third quarter ended July 4, 2010.  Sales increased 15% to $2.2 billion.  Comparable store sales increased 8.8%, or 6.3% on a two-year stacked basis.  Identical store sales, excluding three relocations, increased 8.4%, or 4.6% on a two-year stacked basis.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) increased 27% to $179.8 million from $141.4 million last year.  Income available to common shareholders increased 88% to $65.7 million from $35.0 million last year, and diluted earnings per share increased 53% to $0.38.  Results included relocation, store closure and lease termination costs of $0.7 million versus $18.2 million in the prior year.
We are pleased with our results which compare very favorably to most other food retailers and show we are continuing to gain market share.  Our identical store sales increased 8.4%, accelerating from the second quarter and our highest increase since 2006.  Despite tougher comparisons and the recent dip in reported consumer confidence, our two-year stacked identical store sales also sequentially increased to 4.6%, said John Mackey, co-chief executive officer and co-founder of Whole Foods Market.  Today we are also very excited to announce six new leases.  We have eight leases in negotiation and expect an accelerated pace of lease signings to translate into a higher number of new store openings starting in 2012.
The Companys comparable and identical store sales results for the last five quarters, first four weeks of the fourth quarter, and year to date through August 1, 2010 are shown in the following table.
 
 
During the quarter, the Company produced $117.9 million in cash flow from operations and invested $52.7 million in capital expenditures, of which $32.4 million related to new stores.  This resulted in free cash flow of $65.2 million.  The Company also repaid the $210 million portion of its $700 million term loan that was not subject to an interest rate swap agreement, leaving $490 million outstanding and maturing in August 2012.  Total cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments were $575.2 million, and total debt was $513.6 million.  Currently, the Company has $341.1 million available on its credit line, net of $8.9 million in outstanding letters of credit. 
 
For the 40-week period ended July 4, 2010, sales increased 11% to $6.9 billion.  Comparable store sales increased 6.7%, or 2.9% on a two-year stacked basis, and identical store sales (excluding five relocations and two major expansions) increased 5.9%, or 1.0% on a two-year stacked basis.  EBITDA increased 31% to $548.1 million, income available to common shareholders increased 103% to $182.9 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 71% to $1.10.  Year-to-date results included LIFO credits of $6.5 million versus $2.2 million in the prior year, asset impairment charges of $2.0 million versus $22.2 million in the prior year, FTC-related legal costs of $3.0 million versus $14.2 million in the prior year, a gain of $3.2 million from the sale of a non-operating property, and store closure reserve adjustments of $7.6 million versus $13.5 million in the prior year.
Year to date, the Company has produced $460.9 million in cash flow from operations and invested $199.8 million in capital expenditures, resulting in free cash flow of $261.2 million.
Selected line items for the Companys last five fiscal quarters are shown in the following table.
 
                                  
For the quarter, LIFO credits were $3.7 million versus $5.8 million in the prior year, a negative impact of 14 basis points.  Excluding LIFO, gross profit increased 13 basis points to 35.0% of sales with an improvement in occupancy costs more than offsetting higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales.  Direct store expenses improved 39 basis points to 26.2% of sales driven by leverage in depreciation, wages, healthcare and workers compensation expense as a percentage of sales.  As a result, store contribution, excluding LIFO, improved 52 basis points to 8.8% of sales.
For stores in the identical store base, excluding LIFO, gross profit improved 34 basis points to 35.2% of sales, direct store expenses improved 63 basis points to 26.0% of sales, and store contribution improved 97 basis points to 9.2% of sales
.
G&A expenses, excluding FTC-related legal costs, increased 30 basis points to 3.1% of sales.  FTC-related legal costs were $1.4 million versus $0.4 million in the prior year, and share-based compensation expense was $4.0 million versus $1.2 million in the prior year.
Pre-opening expenses were $8.7 million versus $10.8 million in the prior year.
Relocation, store closure and lease termination expense was $0.7 million versus $18.2 million in the prior year.  Results included a credit adjustment of $0.8 million versus a charge of $9.7 million in the prior year to the store closure reserve primarily related to changes in certain sub-tenant income estimates driven by the outlook for the commercial real estate market.  The prior year also included $6.7 million in non-cash asset impairment charges primarily related to the potential sale of certain operating stores under the FTC settlement agreement.

Growth and Development
The Company opened six stores, acquired two stores, and divested two stores related to the FTC settlement agreement in the third quarter.  The Company currently has 298 stores totaling approximately 11.2 million square feet.  The Company expects to open one store in the fourth quarter.
Since the Companys second quarter earnings release, the Company has terminated leases for two stores in development averaging 45,800 square feet each and reduced the size of one store in development by 10,000 square feet.  The Company also recently signed six new leases averaging 33,900 square feet each in San Francisco, CA; Boise, ID; Minneapolis, MN; Austin, TX (two sites); and Washington, D.C. for stores currently scheduled to open in fiscal year 2012 and beyond. 
The following table provides additional information about the Companys store openings in fiscal years 2009 and 2010 year to date, leases currently tendered but unopened, and total development pipeline (including leases currently tendered) for stores scheduled to open through fiscal year 2014.  For accounting purposes, a store is considered tendered on the date the Company takes possession of the space for construction and other purposes, which is typically when the shell of the store is complete or nearing completion. The average tender period, or length of time between tender date and opening date, will vary depending on several factors, one of which is the number of acquired leases, ground leases and owned properties in development, all of which generally have longer tender periods than standard operating leases.
 
 
FTC Update
On March 6, 2009, Whole Foods Market reached a settlement agreement with the FTC resolving the antitrust challenge to its merger with Wild Oats Markets, Inc.  The agreement called for 19 non-operating stores, 12 acquired Wild Oats stores, one Whole Foods Market store, and the intellectual property (IP) currently in operation to be offered for sale.On June 18, 2010, the FTC approved the sale of two operating stores, one non-operating store, and the IP.  These transactions were completed during the third quarter.  All other stores remain the property of Whole Foods Market without further obligation to the FTC. 
 
Outlook for Fiscal Years 2010 and 2011
The following table provides additional information on the Companys year-to-date results and expectations for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2010.   While the uncertain economic outlook makes it difficult to predict future sales results, the Company also is providing its preliminary expectations for fiscal year 2011.  The Company expects to update this guidance in its fourth quarter earnings announcement in early November.
 
We are projecting steady sales growth for next year and are committed to delivering incremental operating margin improvement as well as earnings growth in excess of sales growth, said Walter Robb, co-chief executive officer of Whole Foods Market.  We believe this guidance appropriately reflects a tempering of our enthusiasm over current sales growth trends with conservatism due to the competitive environment and the economy.
 
 
The low end of the Companys sales guidance for the fourth quarter assumes a deceleration in identical store sales growth on a two-year basis from the 5.0% two-year idents the Company produced in the first four weeks of the fourth quarter.  The high end assumes slight momentum in two-year identical store sales throughout the remainder of the quarter.    
                                                            
For fiscal year 2011, the Company does not expect to generate the same year-over-year basis point improvement in gross profit as a percentage of sales, excluding LIFO, that is expected this year, as the Company has cycled over the shift in its pricing strategy that occurred in the first half of last year.  In addition, the Company is committed to maintaining its relative price positioning which might require a higher level of price investments going forward if favorable buying opportunities are not available to the same extent they have been in the past.
The Company estimates a $21 million decrease in interest expense year over year in fiscal year 2011.  The Company repaid $210 million of its term loan in the third quarter, and the five-year interest rate swap agreement on the remaining $490 million expires on October 1, 2010.
The Company is committed to producing positive free cash flow on an annual basis, including sufficient cash flow to fund the 48 stores in its current development pipeline.  The following table provides information about the Companys estimated store openings through 2014 based on this pipeline.  These openings reflect estimated tender dates, which are subject to change, and do not incorporate any potential new leases, terminations or square footage reductions.
