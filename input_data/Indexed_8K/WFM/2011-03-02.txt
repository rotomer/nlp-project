The Company convened its annual meeting of shareholders on February 28, 2011 pursuant to notice duly given.  The matters voted upon at the meeting and the results of such voting are set forth below:
 
1.             To elect eleven directors to the Board of Directors of the Company to serve one-year terms expiring at the later of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders in 2012 or upon a successor being elected and qualified. All director nominees were duly elected.
 
 
2.             To ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young, LLP as independent auditor for the Company for the fiscal year ending September 25, 2011. This proposal was approved.
 
 
3.             To ratify compensation packages granted to named executive officers. This proposal was approved.
 
 
4.             To determine the frequency of advisory votes on executive compensation. Of the total votes cast, 53% voted for a say-on-pay vote every year, 39% voted for a say-on-pay vote every two years and 7% voted for a say-on-pay vote every three years.  Based on these results, the Board has determined that the Company will hold an advisory shareholder vote on the compensation of executives every year.
 
 
5.             To adopt the shareholder proposal amending the bylaws to permit removal of a director either with or without cause. This proposal was not approved.
 
 
6.             To adopt the shareholder proposal requiring the Chairman of the Board of Directors to be an independent director, whenever possible. This proposal was not approved.
