ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On July 27, 2011, the Company issued a press release announcing its results of operations for its third fiscal quarter ended July 3, 2011. A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, the Company provides information regarding Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA and Free cash flow as additional information about its operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. The Company's management believes that these presentations provide useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its results of operations and financial condition. In addition, management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of the Company as well as a component of incentive compensation. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus non-cash asset impairment charges. The Company defines Free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. The press release includes a tabular reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP net income, which the Company believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
The information contained in this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, is being furnished and shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section. Furthermore, the information contained in this Item 2.02 or Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d) Exhibits
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
AUSTIN, Texas, July 27, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Whole Foods Market, Inc. (Nasdaq:WFM) today reported results for the 12-week third quarter ended July 3, 2011. Sales for the quarter increased 11% to $2.4 billion. Comparable store sales increased 8.4%, or 17.2% on a two-year stacked basis. Identical store sales, excluding four relocations and one expansion, increased 8.1%, or 16.5% on a two-year stacked basis. One and two-year comparable and identical store sales growth included a positive impact of 60 basis points from Easter shifting from the second quarter last year to the third quarter this year. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") increased 15% from the prior year to $206.8 million, net income increased 35% to $88.5 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 30% to $0.50. Results included a LIFO charge of $3.5 million versus a credit of $3.7 million in the prior year; net interest income of $1.7 million versus net interest expense of $5.9 million in the prior year; and an effective tax rate of 37.8% versus 40.1% in the prior year.
"We are continuing to gain market share at a faster rate than most public food retailers as reflected in our 8.5% comparable store sales growth year to date. We attribute much of our success to our value efforts, which have improved our price image, and to continuing to raise the bar in areas that matter to our customers, particularly quality standards and health and wellness," said Walter Robb, co-chief executive officer of Whole Foods Market. "We are producing consistently strong top- and bottom-line results and are very excited to be accelerating our new store openings once again. Through continued innovation and ongoing discipline around expenses and capital allocation, we expect to deliver higher levels of both operating performance and returns on invested capital over time."
The following table shows the Company's comparable and identical store sales results for the last five quarters and for the first three weeks of the current fourth quarter through July 24, 2011.
*Comparable and identical store sales growth includes a negative 50 basis point impact in 2Q11 and a positive 60 basis point impact in 3Q11 from the Easter shift.
**Excluding the Easter shift in both quarters, two-year idents on a sequential basis increased 440 basis points to 16.0% in 2Q11 and declined five basis points to 15.9% in 3Q11.
For the quarter, the LIFO charge was $3.5 million versus a credit of $3.7 million in the prior year, a negative impact of 32 basis points. Excluding LIFO, gross profit increased 52 basis points to 35.5% of sales driven by an improvement in both cost of goods sold and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales. Direct store expenses improved 36 basis points to 25.9% of sales due primarily to leverage in wages and depreciation as a percentage of sales.  As a result, store contribution, excluding LIFO, improved 88 basis points to 9.6% of sales.
For stores in the identical store base, gross profit improved 57 basis points to 35.5% of sales, direct store expenses improved 50 basis points to 25.7% of sales, and store contribution improved 107 basis points to 9.8% of sales
.
G&A expenses decreased 11 basis points to 3.0% of sales.
Pre-opening expenses were $11.8 million versus $8.7 million in the prior year. Relocation, store closure and lease termination costs were $2.4 million versus $0.7 million in the prior year. 
Net interest income was $1.7 million versus net interest expense of $5.9 million in the prior year. This change was due mainly to a $495.6 million decrease in total debt from the prior year.
The effective tax rate was 37.8% versus 40.1% in the prior year due to savings realized by the Company as a result of certain initiatives and investments.
During the quarter, the Company produced $192.4 million in cash flow from operations and invested $102.0 million in capital expenditures, of which $66.6 million related to new stores. This resulted in free cash flow of $90.4 million. In addition, the Company repaid the remaining $190 million balance on its term loan and paid $17.6 million in dividends to shareholders. At the end of the quarter, total cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments were $664.0 million, and total debt (capital lease obligations) was $18.0 million. 
Additional information on the quarter for comparable stores and all stores is provided in the following table.

Year to date, the Company has produced $595.2 million in cash flow from operations and invested $271.6 million in capital expenditures, of which $156.0 million related to new stores.

In addition, the Company repaid the $490 million balance on its term loan and, through July 27, 2011, has paid approximately $52.6 million in dividends to shareholders. 
The following table shows the Company's year-to-date results through the third quarter for certain line items compared to its historical five-year ranges and averages.
Growth and Development
The Company opened seven stores, including three relocations, in the third quarter and has opened two stores, including one relocation, so far in the fourth quarter. The Company expects to open three additional new stores, including one relocation, in the fourth quarter. The Company currently has 309 stores totaling approximately 11.7 million square feet. 
The Company has recently signed eight new leases averaging 30,400 square feet in size in Tucson, AZ; Fremont, CA; Newport Beach, CA; Basalt, CO; Detroit, MI; Columbia, SC; Virginia Beach, VA; and Cheltenham, United Kingdom.  These stores currently are scheduled to open in fiscal year 2012 and beyond.
The following table provides additional information about the Company's store openings in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 year to date, leases currently tendered but unopened, and total development pipeline (including leases currently tendered) for stores scheduled to open through fiscal year 2015. For accounting purposes, a store is considered tendered on the date the Company takes possession of the space for construction and other purposes, which is typically when the shell of the store is complete or nearing completion.
Outlook for Fiscal Years 2011 and 2012
Based on its third quarter results and updated assumptions for the fourth quarter, the Company is raising its diluted earnings per share range for fiscal year 2011 to $1.91 to $1.92, an increase of 34% year over year.  The Company also is providing its initial outlook for fiscal year 2012.  The Company notes that fiscal year 2012 will be a 53-week year, with the extra week falling in the fourth quarter, making it a 13-week quarter. 
The following table provides additional information on the Company's expectations for the fourth quarter, updated outlook for fiscal year 2011, and initial outlook for fiscal year 2012 on a 53-week basis.  The Company notes the fourth quarter is seasonally its weakest quarter of the year in terms of average weekly sales and store contribution excluding LIFO. 
"We are not expecting our acceleration in new store openings to have a meaningful impact on our earnings growth," said John Mackey, co-founder and co-chief executive officer of Whole Foods Market.  "While new stores produce lower store contribution than mature stores, we estimate new stores will account for just 5% of our total sales and thus should not have a material negative impact on our results.  In addition, our new stores are smaller, we are investing less capital in them, and we expect they will achieve higher returns on invested capital than the larger stores we have opened in the past."
*The Company estimates the impact on earnings from the extra week to be $0.06 per share. On a 52-week to 52-week basis, excluding the impact of the extra week in the fourth quarter, the Company expects total sales growth of 11% to 13% and earnings per share growth of 13% to 15%. 
The Company is committed to producing positive free cash flow on an annual basis, including sufficient cash flow to fund the 61 stores in its current development pipeline. The following table provides information about the Company's estimated store openings for the next two fiscal years.
Over the long term, the Company considers 1,000 stores to be a reasonable indication of its market opportunity in the United States as the Whole Foods Market brand continues to strengthen, consumer demand for natural and organic products continues to increase, and the Company's flexibility on new store size opens up additional market opportunities. The Company believes Canada and the United Kingdom hold great promise as well.
