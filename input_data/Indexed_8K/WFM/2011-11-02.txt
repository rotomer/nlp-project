Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On November 2, 2011, the Company issued a press release announcing its results of operations for its fourth fiscal quarter ended September 25, 2011. A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, the Company provides information regarding Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA and Free cash flow as additional information about its operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. The Company's management believes that these presentations provide useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its results of operations and financial condition. In addition, management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of the Company as well as a component of incentive compensation. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus non-cash asset impairment charges. The Company defines Free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. The press release includes a tabular reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP net income, which the Company believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
The information contained in this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, is being furnished and shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section. Furthermore, the information contained in this Item 2.02 or Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
The Company's Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $0.14 per share, payable January 24, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 13, 2012.
In addition, the Company's Board of Directors has authorized a new share repurchase program in the amount of $200 million through November 1, 2013. Under the program, purchases can be made from time to time using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases or purchases through a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, all in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission and other applicable legal requirements. The specific timing, price and size of purchases will depend on prevailing stock prices, general economic and market conditions, and other considerations. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company's discretion.

EXHIBIT 99.1
AUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 2, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Whole Foods Market, Inc. (Nasdaq:WFM) today reported results for the 12-week fourth quarter ended September 25, 2011. Sales for the quarter increased 12% to $2.4 billion. Comparable store sales increased 8.7%, or 17.4% on a two-year stacked basis. Identical store sales, excluding six relocations and one expansion, increased 8.4%, or 17.1% on a two-year stacked basis. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") increased 12% from the prior year to $185.3 million, net income increased 31% to $75.5 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 26% to $0.42. Results included a LIFO charge of $3.8 million versus a credit of $1.2 million in the prior year; pre-opening expenses of $10.9 million versus $4.9 million in the prior year; net interest income of $1.4 million versus net interest expense of $5.7 million in the prior year; and an effective tax rate of 36.4% versus 39.6% in the prior year.
"We are pleased to end the fiscal year on a high note, crossing $10 billion in sales and reporting our eighth consecutive quarter of accelerating two-year identical store sales growth," said John Mackey, co-founder and co-chief executive officer of Whole Foods Market. "Our outlook for fiscal year 2012 reflects consistent identical store sales growth, a record number of new store openings, EBITDA of close to $1 billion, and significant operating margin improvement. We are continuing to produce quality results and expect the lessons we learned during the recession will drive even higher levels of operating performance and returns on invested capital over time."
The following table shows the Company's comparable and identical store sales results for the last five quarters and for the first five weeks of the first quarter through October 30, 2011.
For the quarter, the LIFO charge was $3.8 million versus a credit of $1.2 million in the prior year, a negative impact of 21 basis points. Excluding LIFO, gross profit increased 11 basis points to 34.7% of sales driven by an improvement in occupancy costs as a percentage of sales. Direct store expenses improved 54 basis points to 25.9% of sales due primarily to leverage in wages, depreciation, and healthcare as a percentage of sales.  As a result, store contribution, excluding LIFO, improved 65 basis points to 8.8% of sales.
For stores in the identical store base, gross profit improved 14 basis points to 34.8% of sales, direct store expenses improved 71 basis points to 25.8% of sales, and store contribution improved 85 basis points to 9.0% of sales
.
G&A expenses were flat at 3.1% of sales.
Pre-opening expenses were $10.9 million versus $4.9 million in the prior year, with five new store openings in the fourth quarter this year compared to one in the fourth quarter last year. Relocation, store closure and lease termination costs were $1.8 million versus $0.8 million in the prior year. 
Net interest income was $1.4 million versus net interest expense of $5.7 million in the prior year. This change was due mainly to a decrease in total debt from the prior year.
The effective tax rate was 36.4% versus 39.6% in the prior year due to savings realized by the Company as a result of certain initiatives and investments.
During the quarter, the Company produced $159.6 million in cash flow from operations and invested $93.4 million in capital expenditures, of which $47.4 million related to new stores. This resulted in free cash flow of $66.3 million. In addition, the Company paid $17.7 million in dividends to shareholders and received $85.8 million in proceeds from the exercise of team member stock options.
The Company finished the year with total cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments of $799.1 million, and total debt (capital lease obligations) of $17.9 million. 
The Company today announced that its Board of Directors declared a 40% increase in the Company's quarterly dividend to $0.14 per share from $0.10 per share. The next dividend is payable on January 24, 2012 to shareholders of record as of January 13, 2012. 
In addition, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program in the amount of $200 million through November 1, 2013.  Under the program, purchases can be made from time to time using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases or purchases through a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, all in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission and other applicable legal requirements. The specific timing, price and size of purchases will depend on prevailing stock prices, general economic and market conditions, and other considerations. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company's discretion. 
"With today's dividend increase and share repurchase announcements, our board of directors has shown a clear vote of confidence in our ability to consistently execute and generate strong free cash flow," said Walter Robb, co-chief executive officer of Whole Foods Market. "We are well positioned to internally fund our accelerated new store growth, maintain a healthy cash reserve, increase our dividend, and seek additional value creation for our shareholders through selective stock repurchases."
Additional information on the quarter for comparable stores and all stores is provided in the following table.

Over the long term, the Company considers 1,000 stores to be a reasonable indication of its market opportunity in the United States as the Whole Foods Market brand continues to strengthen, consumer demand for natural and organic products continues to increase, and the Company's flexibility on new store size opens up additional market opportunities. The Company believes Canada and the United Kingdom hold great promise as well.
