Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On July 25, 2012, the Company issued a press release announcing its results of operations for its third fiscal quarter ended July 1, 2012. A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, the Company provides information regarding Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") and Free Cash Flow in the press release as additional information about its operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. The Company's management believes that these presentations provide useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its results of operations and financial condition. In addition, management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of the Company as well as a component of incentive compensation. The Company defines ROIC as annualized adjusted earnings divided by average invested capital. Earnings are annualized on a 52-week basis. Invested capital represents a trailing four-quarter average. The Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. The press release includes a tabular reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP net income, which the Company believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
The information contained in this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, is being furnished and shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section. Furthermore, the information contained in this Item 2.02 or Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

EXHIBIT 99.1
AUSTIN, Texas, July 25, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Whole Foods Market, Inc. (Nasdaq:WFM) today reported results for the 12-week third quarter ended July 1, 2012. Sales for the quarter increased 14% to $2.7 billion. Including a negative impact of 62 basis points from Easter shifting from the third quarter last year to the second quarter this year, comparable store sales increased 8.2%, and identical store sales, excluding six relocations and two expansions, increased 8.0%.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") increased 26% from the prior year to $260.6 million, net income increased 32% to $116.8 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $0.63. 
"In an economic environment that is proving to be difficult for many retailers, we are thriving and pleased to report another quarter of strong growth and excellent results for our stakeholders," said Walter Robb, co-chief executive officer of Whole Foods Market.  "Our accelerated growth plans are on track, and we believe we will continue to gain market share through further differentiating our shopping experience, improving our relative value positioning, and reinforcing our position as America's healthiest grocery store."
The following table shows the Company's comparable and identical store sales results for the last five quarters and for the first three weeks of the fourth quarter through July 22, 2012. 
*Comparable and identical store sales growth includes a positive 60 basis point impact in 3Q11, a positive 55 basis point impact in 2Q12, and a negative 62 basis point impact in 3Q12 from the Easter shift. The basis point impact from the Easter shift is calculated by excluding Easter week from both the current and prior years.
Gross profit increased 62 basis points to 36.0% of sales driven primarily by equal improvements in occupancy costs and cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales. The LIFO charge was $1 million this year versus $3.5 million in the prior year, a positive impact of 11 basis points. Direct store expenses improved 57 basis points to 25.3% of sales due primarily to leverage in wages and health care costs as a percentage of sales.  As a result, store contribution improved 119 basis points to 10.7% of sales.
For stores in the identical store base, gross profit improved 68 basis points to 36.0% of sales, direct store expenses improved 80 basis points to 25.1% of sales, and store contribution improved 148 basis points to 11.0% of sales
.
G&A expenses increased 16 basis points to 3.2% of sales.
During the quarter, the Company produced $211.3 million in cash flow from operations and invested $112.7 million in capital expenditures, of which $74.2 million related to new stores. This resulted in free cash flow of $98.6 million. In addition, the Company paid $25.6 million in dividends to shareholders, repurchased $25.0 million of its common stock, and received $88.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of team member stock options.
The Company ended the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments of approximately $1.5 billion, a sequential increase of $153.8 million and a year-over-year increase of $792.0 million. Total debt (capital lease obligations) was $19.1 million.

* Costs will vary depending on the size of the store, geographic location, degree of work performed by the landlord and complexity of site development issues. To a significant degree, they also depend on how the project is structured, including costs for elements that often increase or decrease rent, e.g., lease acquisition costs, shell and/or garage costs, and landlord allowances.
Outlook for Fiscal Years 2012 and 2013
Based on third quarter results and updated assumptions for the fourth quarter, the Company is raising its diluted earnings per share outlook for fiscal year 2012 to $2.51 to $2.52, an increase of 30% to 31% year over year.  The Company notes that fiscal year 2012 is a 53-week year, with the extra week falling in the fourth quarter, making it a 13-week quarter. The Company also is providing its initial sales growth and diluted EPS outlook for fiscal year 2013, a 52-week year. 
The following table provides additional information on the Company's expectations for the fourth quarter and updated outlook for fiscal year 2012.  The Company notes the fourth quarter is seasonally its weakest quarter of the year in terms of average weekly sales and store contribution. 
*The Company estimates the impact on earnings from the extra week to be $0.06 per share. 
For fiscal year 2013, on a 52-week to 52-week basis, the Company expects sales growth approximately in line with fiscal year 2012, comps of 6.5% to 8.5%, idents of 6.0% to 8.0%, and diluted earnings per share of $2.83 to $2.87, a year-over-year increase of 16% to 17%. The Company expects ending square footage growth of 7% to 8% based on the opening of 28 to 32 new stores, four to six of which will be relocations. 
The following table provides information about the Company's estimated store openings through fiscal year 2014. 
Over the long term, the Company considers 1,000 stores to be a reasonable indication of its market opportunity in the United States as the Whole Foods Market brand continues to strengthen, consumer demand for natural and organic products continues to increase, and the Company's flexibility on new store size opens up additional market opportunities. The Company believes Canada and the United Kingdom hold great promise as well.
