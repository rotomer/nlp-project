Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On November 7, 2012, the Company issued a press release announcing its results of operations for its fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2012. A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, the Company provides information regarding Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA, Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") and Free Cash Flow in the press release as additional information about its operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. The Company's management believes that these presentations provide useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its results of operations and financial condition. In addition, management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of the Company as well as a component of incentive compensation. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus non-cash share-based payments expense and deferred rent. The Company defines ROIC as annualized adjusted earnings divided by average invested capital. Earnings are annualized on a 52-week basis. Invested capital represents a trailing four-quarter average. The Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Additionally, since the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 contained an additional week operating results are not directly comparable to the prior year. The Company's management believes adjusting the reported results for the 13-week and 53-week periods ended September 30, 2012 provides more comparable results quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. For that reason, the Company reported sales growth and diluted EPS growth on 12-week and 52-week bases. The Company adjusted the 13-week and 53-week periods by removing one-thirteenth of the 13-week period results to remove the estimated impact of the additional week in the current year. The press release includes a tabular reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP net income, which the Company believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
The information contained in this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, is being furnished and shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section. Furthermore, the information contained in this Item 2.02 or Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
On November 7, 2012, the Company announced that our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $0.20 per share, payable January 29, 2013 to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 18, 2013.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d) Exhibits
99.1 Press release dated November 7, 2012, regarding fourth fiscal quarter results of operations.

EXHIBIT 99.1
AUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 7, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Whole Foods Market, Inc. (Nasdaq:WFM) today reported results for the 13-week fourth quarter ended September 30, 2012. Year-over-year increases stated herein reflect the comparison of 13 weeks in fiscal year 2012 to 12 weeks in fiscal year 2011. Sales increased 24% to $2.9 billion. Comparable store sales increased 8.5%, and identical store sales, excluding three relocations and two expansions, increased 8.3%.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") increased 36% from the prior year to $252.2 million, net income increased 49% to $112.7 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 44% to $0.60. 
"We ended the year with strong sales growth and record fourth quarter results, delivering the best year in our Company's 32-year history," said John Mackey, co-founder and co-chief executive officer of Whole Foods Market.  "The pace of new store openings and lease signings continues to increase, and our accelerated growth plans are on track. We expect healthy comparable store sales growth and continuing operating margin improvement in fiscal year 2013."
The following table shows the Company's comparable and identical store sales results for the last five quarters and for the first five weeks of the first quarter through November 4, 2012. Sales growth for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 is presented on a 12-week to 12-week basis.
Hurricane Sandy negatively impacted sales for the first five weeks of the first quarter, particularly in the Northeast region.    The Company has property, flood, casualty, and business interruption insurance coverage and has just started the process of working with its insurer to assess damages, a process that could take several months. The Company expects to record a one-time charge in the first quarter for estimated uninsured losses.
For the quarter, gross profit increased 76 basis points to 35.3% of sales driven by improvements in both cost of goods sold and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales. The LIFO credit was $1.9 million this year versus a charge of $3.8 million in the prior year, a positive impact of 22 basis points. Direct store expenses improved 40 basis points to 25.5% of sales due primarily to leverage in wages and depreciation as a percentage of sales.  As a result, store contribution improved 117 basis points to 9.8% of sales.
For stores in the identical store base, gross profit improved 84 basis points to 35.3% of sales, direct store expenses improved 64 basis points to 25.2% of sales, and store contribution improved 148 basis points to 10.1% of sales
.
The effective tax rate was 36.4%, in line with the prior year but below the Company's year-to-date average in the third quarter of 38.6% due to an increase in state tax credits, along with a one-time reduction of reserves for tax positions related to a prior acquisition. 
During the quarter, the Company produced $188.8 million in cash flow from operations and invested $130.3 million in capital expenditures, of which $72.9 million related to new stores. This resulted in free cash flow of $58.6 million. In addition, the Company received $45.0 million in proceeds from the exercise of team member stock options and paid $25.8 million in dividends to shareholders.
Additional information on the quarter for comparable stores and all stores is provided in the following table.

For the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2012, sales increased 16% to $11.7 billion, comparable store sales increased 8.7%, and identical store sales, excluding seven relocations and three expansions, increased 8.4%. EBITDA increased 26% to $1.1 billion, net income increased 36% to $465.6 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 31% to $2.52. 
For the fiscal year, the Company produced $919.7 million in cash flow from operations and invested $456.2 million in capital expenditures, of which $261.7 million related to new stores.

In addition, the Company received $370.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of team member stock options, paid $94.5 million in dividends to shareholders, and repurchased $28.6 million of common stock.
The Company finished the year with total cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments of $1.5 billion, a year-over-year increase of $745.4 million. Total debt (capital lease obligations) was $24.1 million.
The Company today announced that its Board of Directors declared a 43% increase in the Company's quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share from $0.14 per share. The next dividend is payable on January 29, 2013 to shareholders of record as of January 18, 2013.
"The Board's decision to increase our dividend for the second consecutive year reflects another year of record-setting financial performance, and underscores our confidence in our future growth and cash flow generation," said Walter Robb, co-chief executive officer of Whole Foods Market. "With $1.3 billion in available cash, we expect to continue to internally fund our accelerated new store growth, maintain a healthy reserve, and create additional value for our shareholders through selective share repurchases and a higher dividend."
The following table shows the Company's results for the fiscal year for certain line items compared to its historical five-year ranges and averages. Fiscal year 2012 sales growth is presented on a 52-week to 52-week basis.
Growth and Development
The Company opened seven stores in the fourth quarter and has opened seven stores so far in the first quarter. The Company expects to open three additional stores in the first quarter. The Company currently has 342 stores totaling approximately 13.0 million square feet. 
The Company recently signed 11 new leases averaging 37,500 square feet in size in Altamonte Springs, FL; Clearwater, FL; Hyannis, MA; North Carolina; Morristown, NJ; New York City, NY (two stores); Philadelphia, PA; South Hills, PA; Dallas, TX; and Seattle, WA.  These stores currently are scheduled to open in fiscal year 2014 and beyond. 
In addition, the Company recently announced plans to purchase six leases from Johnnie's Foodmaster, expanding its presence in the Greater Boston area to 26 stores. The six leases include South Weymouth, Arlington, Charlestown, Brookline, Melrose and Somerville and average 31,000 square feet in size. Johnnie's Foodmaster will close the stores prior to the November 30 transaction closing date. The Company plans to remodel and reopen the locations as Whole Foods Market stores before the end of September 2013. The Company does not expect this transaction to be material to sales or earnings in fiscal year 2013.
The following table provides additional information about the Company's store openings in fiscal years 2011, 2012 and 2013 year to date; leases currently tendered but unopened; and total development pipeline (including leases currently tendered) for stores scheduled to open through fiscal year 2016. 
Outlook for Fiscal Year 2013
The following table provides information on the Company's estimated and actual results for fiscal year 2012, a 53-week year, as well as additional information about the Company's outlook for fiscal year 2013. The Company's outlook for fiscal year 2013 includes the recently announced acquisition of six leases from Johnnie's Foodmaster which is scheduled to close on November 30, 2012. It does not include the one-time charge the Company expects to record in the first quarter for Hurricane Sandy. On a 52-week to 52-week basis, the Company expects sales growth of 12% to 14%, comparable store sales growth of 6.5% to 8.5%, identical store sales growth of 6.0% to 8.0%, and diluted earnings per share growth of 14% to 16% to $2.83 to $2.87.
The following table provides information about the Company's estimated store openings through fiscal year 2014. 
Over the long term, the Company considers 1,000 stores to be a reasonable indication of its market opportunity in the United States as the Whole Foods Market brand continues to strengthen, consumer demand for natural and organic products continues to increase, and the Company's flexibility on new store size opens up additional market opportunities. The Company believes Canada and the United Kingdom hold great promise as well.
