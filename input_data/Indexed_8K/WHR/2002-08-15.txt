"He brings to Whirlpool considerable experience that reflects our company's own global platform, brand-focused strategy and operating requirements." Barrett, who also will join Whirlpool's Executive Committee, succeeds Mark Brown, who was named to an expanded leadership role. Brown was appointed senior vice president in charge of global strategic sourcing, where he will lead the company's global initiatives for supply-chain management, manufacturing and procurement. Whirlpool Corporation is the world's leading manufacturer and marketer of major home appliances.
