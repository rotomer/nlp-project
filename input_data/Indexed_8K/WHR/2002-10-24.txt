Exhibit A Summary Annual Report for Whirlpool Corporation 401(k) Plan This is a summary of the annual report for the Whirlpool Corporation 401(k) Plan, EIN 38-1490038, Plan No. 001, for the period January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2001. The annual report has been filed with the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, as required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Basic Financial Statement Benefits under the plan are funded by assets held in a trust. Plan expenses were $83,517,446. These expenses included $223,605 in plan expenses and $83,293,841 in benefits paid to participants and beneficiaries. A total of 27,931 persons were participants in or beneficiaries of the plan at the end of the plan year, although not all of these persons have the right to receive benefits. The value of plan assets, after subtracting liabilities of the plan, was $745,900,126 as of December 31, 2001*, compared to $772,710,456 as of January 1, 2001. During the plan year the plan experienced a decrease in its net assets of $26,810,330. This decrease includes unrealized appreciation and depreciation in the value of plan assets; that is, the difference between the value of the plan's assets at the end of the year and the value of the assets at the beginning of the year or the cost of assets acquired during the year. The plan had total income of $56,707,116 including employer contributions of $15,756,559, employee contributions of $56,157,139, and earnings from investments of $(22,582,920).
