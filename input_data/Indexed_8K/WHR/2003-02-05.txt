REPORTS 4/th/ QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR RESULTS FOR 2002; COMPANY POSTS RECORD SALES; Results Include Charges to Complete Global Restructuring Effort BENTON HARBOR, Mich., Feb. 5, 2003--Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) today announced fourth-quarter 2002 results, highlighted by record sales and a solid operating performance that was in line with expectations. Charges for the restructuring initiative and the company's previously announced write-off of aircraft-lease assets were reflected in a fourth-quarter net loss of $29 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $21 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in the prior year period. Excluding fourth-quarter charges, core earnings of $113 million increased 4 percent from the prior year period. Core earnings of $1.64 per diluted share compared to $1.58 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2001. Net sales of $2.9 billion increased 11 percent from the prior year period. Excluding consolidated sales from the company's acquisitions in 2002--Polar S.A. of Poland and Vitromatic S.A. de C.V. of Mexico--and the impact from currency translations, net sales increased 7 percent. For the full year, record net sales of $11 billion were up 6 percent from 2001, or 5 percent excluding consolidated sales from the company's acquisitions in 2002 and the impact from currency translations. "Despite the economic uncertainties in virtually every market in which we compete worldwide, our operations delivered record sales and a solid operating performance," said David R. Whitwam, Whirlpool's chairman and chief executive officer. "Much of the improvement is due to Whirlpool's brand and innovation strategies and the success of our new product introductions in every part of the world. During the quarter, we also recorded final charges for the company's global restructuring effort that began in December 2000. When fully implemented, the restructuring is expected to reduce annual costs by more than $200 million. The fourth-quarter contributions from restructuring, productivity and innovation have strengthened our global business portfolio and positioned our operations for continued growth in 2003."

The company believes this additional view of earnings provides shareholders with relevant information about the company's performance.

page two--Whirlpool Corp. Reports 4/th/ Qtr. And Full-Year Results for 2002 Fourth Quarter Global Highlights .. Improvement in operating performance was in line with expectations .. North America sales were a record for the company .. Europe and Asia posted improved sales and operating profit .. Latin America operating profit improved significantly from the prior year .. The company recorded charges to complete its global restructuring initiative .. The company successfully completed the integration of Vitromatic S.A. de C.V. and Polar S.A. .. With the addition of fourth-quarter introductions--including the KitchenAid brand Briva in-sink dishwasher, Whirlpool brand Polara refrigerated range, and the Gladiator GarageWorks brand line of innovative storage systems and appliances for the garage--the company set a record for the most product innovations in a single year. .. Whirlpool brand introduced the Family Studio to the U.S. builder market in January 2003. Designed to transform the traditional laundry space, Family Studio brings together a full range of fabric-care products enclosed in custom cabinetry. Family Studio includes the Duet front loading washer/dryer pair, Personal Valet clothes vitalizer, a new fabric drying closet and other innovative fabric-care products. Fourth-Quarter Region Review Whirlpool North America delivered record sales of $1.9 billion during the quarter with a 16-percent improvement from the prior year period, or 9 percent excluding Whirlpool Mexico. Much of the improvement was based on the market success of innovative products introduced in 2002 by the Whirlpool and KitchenAid brands. Whirlpool Mexico also contributed record sales results during the quarter, a reflection of the company's success in integrating the 2002 acquisition. Operating profit was down slightly from the previous year period due to reduced pension credit, higher spending for brand advertising and innovation initiatives, and reduced production volume to balance inventory levels during the quarter. The Whirlpool brand Duet front loading washer/dryer pair continued to generate strong consumer interest and demand in the market. U.S. appliance industry unit shipments increased 7 percent compared to the prior year. --more--
page three--Whirlpool Corp. Reports 4/th/ Qtr. And Full-Year Results for 2002 Whirlpool Europe's sales of $623 million improved 13 percent, or 2 percent excluding currency translations, in a market where industry unit shipments declined by 3 percent. Within a region environment of low GDP growth, declining demand and aggressive pricing, the company delivered an operating profit margin improvement of 1.2 percentage points compared to the prior year period. Contributing to the improvement was the market success of new product innovations--including the Whirlpool brand Duet washer and the new European side-by-side refrigerator--productivity gains and benefits from restructuring. Whirlpool Latin America's performance was affected by economic and political factors in Brazil and throughout the region. Sales of $316 million were down 12 percent, or up 9 percent excluding currency translations. Operating profit improved 12 percent from the prior-year period. The improvement was due to increased production of appliances for export sales through Whirlpool's worldwide distribution network, and savings from productivity and restructuring initiatives. Appliance industry unit shipments were flat compared to the prior year period. Whirlpool Asia delivered record sales and operating profit during the quarter. Sales of $108 million grew by 13 percent, and operating profit margin improved by 1.4 percentage points. The results were driven by strong growth in China and continuing growth in the company's leading market position in India. Final Charges Recorded for Global Restructuring Initiative During the quarter, the company recorded restructuring and related charges of $107 million pre-tax ($84 million after-tax). The charges relate to manufacturing rationalization initiatives in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia. The fourth-quarter costs were the final charges associated with Whirlpool's global restructuring initiative first announced in December 2000. In total, the initiative has resulted in restructuring and related charges of $373 million. When fully implemented, the global restructuring is expected to result in annualized savings of more than $200 million. Pension Equity Adjustments, Expenses and Assumptions Due to the decline of the U.S. equity markets and the resulting lower value of the company's pension fund assets at Dec. 31, 2002, the company was required to record an additional minimum pension liability. As a result, the company recorded a $151 million, after tax, non-cash charge to equity in the fourth quarter. As previously announced, Whirlpool expects to recognize a $63 million pension expense in 2003, based on lower asset-return rate and discount-rate assumptions associated with the company's U.S. pension plans. For 2003, the rate-of-return assumption for the company's U.S. plans is 8 3/4 percent, down from 10 percent in 2002. The discount rate is 6 3/4 percent, down from 7 1/2 percent in 2002. The company also currently anticipates a $20 million cash contribution to its U.S. pension fund in 2003. Full-Year Results For the year, the company reported a net loss of $394 million, or $5.68 per diluted share compared to net earnings of $21 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in 2001. Full-year net earnings were significantly affected by a non-cash, after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $613 million related to a change in accounting principle; a $121 million after-tax charge for restructuring and related activities; and a $43 million after-tax write-off of aircraft lease assets in discontinued operations. --more--
page four--Whirlpool Corp. Reports 4/th/ Qtr. And Full-Year Results for 2002 Excluding one-time charges, full-year core earnings of $420 million, or $6.07 per diluted share, compared to $371 million, or $5.45 per diluted share, in 2001. Full-year net sales of $11 billion compared to $10.3 billion in 2001. Free cash flow of $290 million exceeded the company's full-year forecast. Outlook "Entering 2003, economic uncertainty continues in most markets in which we participate," said Whitwam. "Nevertheless, based on the ongoing savings and efficiencies resulting from our completed restructuring initiative and other productivity efforts, Whirlpool is well positioned to manage these uncertainties. We also expect the cross-region benefits of our unique global platform and the ongoing innovation activities by our global brands to drive Whirlpool's growth and leadership position throughout 2003." Based on current economic and industry forecasts for markets around the world, the company expects full-year earnings in 2003 to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.40 per share.
