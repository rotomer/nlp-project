This is a summary of the annual report for the WHIRLPOOL CORPORATION 401(K) PLAN, EIN 38-1490038, Plan No. 001, for the period January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2004.  The annual report has been filed with the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, as required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
 
Benefits under the plan are provided through a trust fund.  Plan expenses were $65,999,753.  These expenses included $200,067 in administrative expenses, $65,350,684 in benefits paid to participants and beneficiaries, and $449,002 in other expenses.  A total of 30,701 persons were participants in or beneficiaries of the plan at the end of the plan year, although not all of these persons had yet earned the right to receive benefits.

During the plan year the plan experienced an increase in its net assets of $75,583,043.  This increase includes unrealized appreciation and depreciation in the value of plan assets; that is, the difference between the value of the plan's assets at the end of the year and the value of the assets at the beginning of the year or the cost of assets acquired during the year.
