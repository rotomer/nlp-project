Whirlpool may permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitment in whole, or in part ratably among the Lenders in integral multiples of $25,000,000, upon at least three Business Days' written notice to the Administrative Agent, which notice shall specify the amount of any such reduction; provided, however, that the amount of the Aggregate Commitment may not be reduced below the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Advances plus the outstanding LOC Obligations. 20
(d) Minimum Amount of Each Committed Advance. Each Committed Advance made or continued hereunder shall be in the minimum Dollar Amount of $25,000,000 or a higher integral multiple of $5,000,000; provided, however, that any Floating Rate Advance may be in the aggregate amount of the unused Aggregate Commitment. (e) Method of Selecting Types and Interest Periods for New Committed Advances. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Credit Agreement, each Borrower shall select the Type of Advance and, in the case of each Eurocurrency Committed Advance, the Interest Period applicable thereto, for each Committed Advance from time to time made to it. A Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent an irrevocable notice substantially in the form of Exhibit "H" hereto (a "Committed Borrowing Notice") not later than 11:30 a.m. (New York City time) on the Borrowing Date of each Floating Rate Advance, three Business Days before the Borrowing Date for each Eurocurrency Committed Advance denominated in Dollars, and five Business Days before the Borrowing Date for each Eurocurrency Committed Advance denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars. A Committed Borrowing Notice shall in accordance with all the terms and conditions of this Credit Agreement specify: (i) the Borrower to which such Committed Advance is to be made; (ii) the Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day, of such Committed Advance; (iii) the Type of Committed Advance selected; (iv) in the case of each Eurocurrency Committed Advance, the Agreed Currency of such Committed Advance; (v) the aggregate amount of such Committed Advance; and (vi) in the case of each Eurocurrency Committed Advance, the Interest Period applicable thereto. (f) Continuation and Conversion of Dollar-Denominated Committed Advances. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Credit Agreement, each Floating Rate Advance shall continue as a Floating Rate Advance unless and until such Floating Rate Advance is paid or converted into one or more Dollar-denominated Eurocurrency Committed Advances. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Credit Agreement, each Eurocurrency Committed Advance denominated in Dollars shall continue as a Dollar-denominated Eurocurrency Committed Advance until the end of the then applicable Interest Period therefor, at which time such Eurocurrency Committed Advance shall be automatically converted into a Floating Rate Advance (x) unless such Eurocurrency Committed Advance is paid by the applicable Borrower or the applicable Borrower shall have given the Administrative Agent an irrevocable 21
notice substantially in the form of Exhibit "I" hereto (a "Dollar Continuation/Conversion Notice") requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period, such Eurocurrency Committed Advance continue as a Dollar-denominated Eurocurrency Committed Advance for the same or another specified Interest Period, be converted into one or more new Dollar-denominated Eurocurrency Committed Advances each having a specified new Interest Period or be converted into a Floating Rate Advance or (y) if any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Accordingly, but subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Credit Agreement, each Borrower may elect from time to time to convert all or any part (subject to Section 2.03(d)) of a Dollar-denominated Committed Advance of any Type made to it into the other Type of Dollar-denominated Committed Advance; provided that any conversion of a Eurocurrency Committed Advance shall be made on, and only on, the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto. The applicable Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent a Dollar Continuation/Conversion Notice with respect to each continuation or conversion of a Dollar-denominated Committed Advance not later than 11:30 A.M. (New York City time) at least three Business Days prior to the date of the requested continuation or conversion, specifying in accordance with all of the terms and conditions of this Credit Agreement: (i) the requested date, which shall be a Business Day, of such continuation or conversion; (ii) the aggregate amount and Type of the Committed Advance which is to be continued or converted; (iii) the amount and Type(s) of the Dollar-denominated Committed Advance(s) into which such Committed Advance is to be continued or converted; and (iv) in the case of each continuation of or conversion into a Dollar-denominated Eurocurrency Committed Advance, the Interest Period applicable thereto (provided that if no Interest Period is specified, the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have requested an Interest Period of one month). (g) Payment or Continuation and Conversion of Non-Dollar Denominated Committed Advances. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Credit Agreement, each Eurocurrency Committed Advance denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars shall continue as a Eurocurrency Committed Advance denominated in the same currency until the end of the then applicable Interest Period therefor, at which time such Eurocurrency Committed Advance shall mature and be payable by the applicable Borrower on the last day of the applicable Interest Period unless the applicable Borrower shall have given the Administrative Agent an irrevocable notice substantially in the form of Exhibit "J" hereto (a "Non-Dollar Continuation/Conversion Notice") requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period, such Eurocurrency Committed Advance either continue as a Eurocurrency Committed Advance denominated in the same currency for the same or another specified Interest Period or be converted into one or more new Eurocurrency Committed Advances each denominated in 22
the same currency as that of the converted Eurocurrency Committed Advance and having a specified new Interest Period; provided that if after giving effect to any such conversion or continuation, the aggregate Dollar Amount of the principal amount of all Advances plus the outstanding LOC Obligations would exceed the Aggregate Commitment, such Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of such Eurocurrency Committed Advance on the last day of the Interest Period then ending such that the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Advances plus the outstanding LOC Obligations does not exceed the Aggregate Commitment. Accordingly, but subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Credit Agreement, each Borrower may elect from time to time to convert all or any part (subject to Section 2.03(d)) of a Eurocurrency Committed Advance denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars made to it into any other Eurocurrency Committed Advance(s) denominated in the same currency as the converted Eurocurrency Committed Advance; provided that any such conversion shall be made on, and only on, the last day of the Interest Period applicable to the converted Eurocurrency Committed Advance. The applicable Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent a Non-Dollar Continuation/Conversion Notice with respect to each continuation or conversion of a Eurocurrency Committed Advance denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars not later than 11:30 A.M. (New York City time) at least five Business Days prior to the date of the requested continuation or conversion specifying in accordance with all of the terms and conditions of this Credit Agreement: (i) the requested date, which shall be a Business Day, of such continuation or conversion; (ii) the aggregate amount and Agreed Currency of the Eurocurrency Committed Advance which is to be continued or converted; (iii) the amount(s) of the Eurocurrency Committed Advance(s) into which such Eurocurrency Committed Advance is to be continued or converted; and (iv) the Interest Period applicable to each new Eurocurrency Committed Advance (provided that if no Interest Period is specified or if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have requested an Interest Period of one month). (h) Notice to Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to each Lender of each Dollar Continuation/Conversion Notice and each Non-Dollar Continuation/Conversion Notice received by it. SECTION 2.04. LETTER OF CREDIT SUBFACILITY. (a) Issuance. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and in reliance upon the representations and warranties set forth herein and upon the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this Section 2.04, the Issuing Lender agrees to issue, and each Lender severally agrees to participate in the issuance by the Issuing Lender of, standby Letters of Credit in Agreed Currencies from time to time from 23
the Closing Date until the date thirty days prior to the Termination Date as any Borrower may request, in a form acceptable to the Issuing Lender; provided, however, that (i) the Dollar Amount of the LOC Obligations outstanding shall not at any time exceed the LOC Committed Amount and (ii) the Dollar Amount of the principal amount of all Advances plus the outstanding LOC Obligations shall not at any time exceed the Aggregate Commitment. The Issuing Lender shall not issue any Letter of Credit if (x) the original expiry date of such Letter of Credit is more than one year from the date of issuance (provided that such Letter of Credit may contain customary "evergreen" provisions pursuant to which the expiry date is automatically extended by a specific time period unless the Issuing Lender gives notice to the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit at least a specified time period prior to the expiry date then in effect) or (y) such Letter of Credit has an expiry date extending beyond the Termination Date. The Issuing Lender shall be under no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate any applicable laws, rules, regulations or orders or any generally applicable policy of the Issuing Lender, including, without limitation, any order, judgment or decree of any government authority or arbitrator that by its terms purports to enjoin or restrain the Issuing Lender from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any governmental authority with jurisdiction over the Issuing Lender that prohibits, or requests that the Issuing Lender refrain from the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or that imposes upon the Issuing Lender with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the Issuing Lender is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or that imposes upon the Issuing Lender any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which the Issuing Lender in good faith deems material to it. Each Letter of Credit shall be a standby letter of credit and shall comply with the related LOC Documents. The issuance and expiry dates of each Letter of Credit shall be a Business Day. (b) Notice and Reports. Any Borrower may request the issuance of a Letter of Credit by submitting a request therefor to the Issuing Lender (by completion of the appropriate application forms of the Issuing Lender) at least three Business Days prior to the requested date of issuance. At least quarterly (and more frequently upon request) the Issuing Lender shall provide to the Administrative Agent a detailed report specifying the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Lender which are then issued and outstanding. The Administrative Agent shall disseminate promptly to each of the Lenders the information provided by the Issuing Lender pursuant to this subsection (b). (c) Participation. Each Lender, upon issuance of a Letter of Credit, shall be deemed to have purchased without recourse a Participation Interest from the Issuing Lender in such Letter of Credit and the obligations arising thereunder and any collateral relating thereto, in each case in an amount equal to its pro rata share of the obligations under such Letter of Credit (ratably in proportion to the ratio that its respective Commitment bears to the Aggregate Commitment) and shall absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably assume and be obligated to pay to the Issuing Lender and discharge when due, its pro rata share of the obligations arising under such Letter of Credit. Without limiting the scope and nature of 24
each Lender's Participation Interest in any Letter of Credit, to the extent that the Issuing Lender has not been reimbursed as required hereunder or under any such Letter of Credit, each such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender its pro rata share of such unreimbursed drawing in same day funds on the day of notification by the Administrative Agent of an unreimbursed drawing pursuant to the provisions of subsection (d) below. The obligation of each Lender to so reimburse the Issuing Lender shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by the occurrence of an Unmatured Default, a Default or any other occurrence or event. Any such reimbursement shall not relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the applicable Borrower to reimburse the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as hereinafter provided. (d) Reimbursement. In the event of any drawing under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender will promptly notify the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent. The applicable Borrower promises to reimburse the Issuing Lender (such reimbursement to be made to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender) on the day of drawing under any Letter of Credit either in same day funds in the same Agreed Currency as the related drawing or with a Committed Advance in Dollars in the Dollar Amount of such drawing. Unless such Borrower shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender that such Borrower intends to otherwise reimburse the Issuing Lender for such drawing, such Borrower shall be deemed to have requested that the Lenders make a Committed Advance in Dollars in the Dollar Amount of the drawing as provided in subsection (e) below on the related Letter of Credit, the proceeds of which will be used to satisfy the related reimbursement obligations. Each Borrower's reimbursement obligations hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under all circumstances irrespective of any rights of setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment such Borrower may claim or have against the Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit drawn upon or any other Person, including without limitation any defense based on any failure of a Borrower to receive consideration or the legality, validity, regularity or unenforceability of the Letter of Credit. The Issuing Lender will promptly notify the Administrative Agent, who shall, in turn, promptly notify the other Lenders of the amount of any unreimbursed drawing and each Lender shall promptly pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender in Dollars and in immediately available funds, the Dollar Amount of such Lender's pro rata share of such unreimbursed drawing. Such payment shall be made on the day such notice is received by such Lender from the Administrative Agent if such notice is received at or before 11:00 A.M. (New York City time), and otherwise such payment shall be made at or before 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the Business Day next succeeding the day such notice is received. If such Lender does not pay such amount to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender in full upon such request, such Lender shall, on demand, pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender interest on the unpaid amount during the period from the date of such drawing until such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender in full at a rate per annum equal to, if paid within two Business Days of the date that such Lender is required to make payments of such amount pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Federal Funds Effective Rate 25
and thereafter at a rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate. Each Lender's obligation to make such payment to the Issuing Lender, and the right of the Issuing Lender to receive the same, shall be absolute and unconditional, shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever and without regard to the termination of this Credit Agreement or the Commitments hereunder, the existence of an Unmatured Default or a Default or the acceleration of the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder and shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Simultaneously with the making of each such payment by a Lender to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender, such Lender shall, automatically and without any further action on the part of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender, acquire a Participation Interest in an amount equal to such payment (excluding the portion of such payment constituting interest owing to the Issuing Lender) in the related unreimbursed drawing portion of the LOC Obligation and in the interest thereon and in the related LOC Documents, and shall have a claim against the applicable Borrower with respect thereto. (e) Repayment with Committed Advances. On any day on which a Borrower shall have requested, or been deemed to have requested a Committed Advance to reimburse a drawing under a Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall give notice to the Lenders that a Committed Advance has been requested or deemed requested by such Borrower to be made in connection with a drawing under a Letter of Credit, in which case a Committed Advance comprised of Floating Rate Loans in the Dollar Amount of the unreimbursed drawing shall be immediately made to such Borrower by all Lenders (notwithstanding any termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 9.01) ratably in proportion to the ratio that their respective Commitments bear to the Aggregate Commitment (determined before giving effect to any termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 9.01) and the proceeds thereof shall be paid directly to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender for application to the respective LOC Obligations. Each such Lender hereby irrevocably agrees to make its pro rata share of each such Committed Advance immediately upon any such request or deemed request in the amount, in the manner and on the date specified in the preceding sentence notwithstanding (i) the amount of such borrowing may not comply with the minimum amount for Advances otherwise required hereunder, (ii) whether any conditions specified in Section 5.03 are then satisfied, (iii) whether an Unmatured Default or a Default then exists, (iv) failure for any such request or deemed request for such Advance to be made by the time otherwise required hereunder, (v) whether the date of such borrowing is a date on which Committed Advances are otherwise permitted to be made hereunder or (vi) any termination of the Commitments relating thereto immediately prior to or contemporaneously with such borrowing. In the event that any Committed Advance cannot for any reason be made on the date otherwise required above (including, without limitation, as a result of the commencement of a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code with respect to any Borrower), then each such Lender hereby agrees that it shall forthwith purchase (as of the date such borrowing would otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for any payments received from the applicable Borrower on or after such date and prior to such purchase) from the Issuing Lender such Participation Interests in the outstanding LOC Obligations as shall be necessary to cause each such 26
Lender to share in such LOC Obligations ratably in proportion to the ratio that their respective Commitments bear to the Aggregate Commitment (determined before giving effect to any termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 9.01)), provided that at the time any purchase of Participation Interests pursuant to this sentence is actually made, the purchasing Lender shall be required to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender, to the extent not paid to the Issuing Lender by the applicable Borrower in accordance with the terms of subsection (d) above, interest on the principal amount of Participation Interests purchased for each day from and including the day upon which such borrowing would otherwise have occurred to but excluding the date of payment for such Participation Interests, at the rate equal to, if paid within two Business Days of the date of the Committed Advance, the Federal Funds Effective Rate, and thereafter at a rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate. (f) Designation of Subsidiaries as Account Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Credit Agreement, including without limitation Section 2.04(a), a Letter of Credit issued hereunder may contain a statement to the effect that such Letter of Credit is issued for the account of any Subsidiary of a Borrower, provided that notwithstanding such statement, such Borrower shall be the actual account party for all purposes of this Credit Agreement for such Letter of Credit and such statement shall not affect such Borrower's reimbursement obligations hereunder with respect to such Letter of Credit. (g) Renewal, Extension. The renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit shall, for purposes hereof, be treated in all respects the same as the issuance of a new Letter of Credit hereunder. (h) Uniform Customs and Practices. The Issuing Lender may have the Letters of Credit be subject to The Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (the "UCP") or the International Standby Practices 1998 (the "ISP98"), in either case as published as of the date of issue by the International Chamber of Commerce, in which case the UCP or the ISP98, as applicable, may be incorporated therein and deemed in all respects to be a part thereof. (i) Indemnification; Nature of Issuing Lender's Duties. (i) In addition to its other obligations under this Section 2.04, each Borrower hereby agrees to pay, and protect, indemnify and save each Lender harmless from and against, any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that such Lender may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (A) the issuance of any Letter of Credit or (B) the failure of the Issuing Lender to honor a drawing under a Letter of Credit as a result of any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto government or Governmental Authority (all such acts or omissions, herein called "Government Acts"). 27
(ii) As between the Borrowers and the Lenders (including the Issuing Lender), the applicable Borrower shall assume all risks of the acts, omissions or misuse of any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof. Except to the extent arising solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Lender, no Lender (including the Issuing Lender) shall be responsible: (A) for the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for and issuance of any Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (B) for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, that may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (C) for errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (D) for any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under a Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; and (E) for any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of such Lender, including, without limitation, any Government Acts. None of the above shall affect, impair, or prevent the vesting of the Issuing Lender's rights or powers hereunder. (iii) In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific provisions hereinabove set forth, any action taken or omitted by any Lender (including the Issuing Lender), under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related certificates, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put such Lender under any resulting liability to any Borrower. It is the intention of the parties that this Credit Agreement shall be construed and applied to protect and indemnify each Lender (including the Issuing Lender) against any and all risks involved in the issuance of the Letters of Credit, all of which risks are hereby assumed by the Borrowers, including, without limitation, any and all Government Acts. No Lender (including the Issuing Lender) shall, in any way, be liable for any failure by the Issuing Lender to pay any drawing under any Letter of Credit as a result of any Government Acts or any other cause beyond the control of the Issuing Lender. (iv) Nothing in this Section 2.04(i) is intended to limit the reimbursement obligations of any Borrower contained in subsection (d) above. The obligations of each Borrower under this Section 2.04(i) shall survive the termination of this Credit Agreement. No act or omission of any current or prior beneficiary of a Letter of Credit shall in any way affect or impair the rights of the Lenders (including the Issuing Lender) to enforce any right, power or benefit under this Credit Agreement. (v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.04(i), no Borrower shall have any obligation to indemnify the Issuing Lender in respect of any liability incurred by the Issuing Lender (A) arising solely out of the gross 28
negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Lender, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, or (B) caused by the Issuing Lender's failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, unless such payment is prohibited by any law, regulation, court order or decree. (j) Responsibility of Issuing Lender. It is expressly understood and agreed that the obligations of the Issuing Lender hereunder to the Lenders are only those expressly set forth in this Credit Agreement and that the Issuing Lender shall be entitled to assume that the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.03 have been satisfied unless it shall have acquired actual knowledge or received written notice from the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Lender that any such condition precedent has not been satisfied; provided, however, that nothing set forth in this Section 2.04 shall be deemed to prejudice the right of any Lender to recover from the Issuing Lender any amounts made available by such Lender to the Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section 2.04 in the event that it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the payment with respect to a Letter of Credit constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Lender. (k) Conflict with LOC Documents. In the event of any conflict between this Credit Agreement and any LOC Document (including any letter of credit application), this Credit Agreement shall control. (l) Appointment of Issuing Lender. Citibank is hereby appointed as Issuing Lender hereunder and under each other Loan Document and each of the Lenders authorizes the Issuing Lender to act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit and related LOC Documents. SECTION 2.05. COMPETITIVE BID ADVANCES. (a) Competitive Bid Option; Repayment of Competitive Bid Advances. In addition to Committed Advances pursuant to Section 2.03 and Fronted Advances pursuant to Section 2.06, but subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, the limitation set forth in Section 2.01 as to the maximum aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Advances and LOC Obligations hereunder), each Borrower may, as set forth in this Section 2.05, request the Lenders, prior to the Termination Date, to make offers to make Competitive Bid Advances in Dollars to such Borrower. Each Lender may, but shall have no obligation to, make such offers and the applicable Borrower may, but shall have no obligation to, accept any such offers in the manner set forth in this Section 2.05. Each applicable Borrower promises to repay each of its Competitive Bid Advances in full by on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto. 29
(b) Competitive Bid Quote Request. When a Borrower wishes to request offers to make Competitive Bid Loans under this Section 2.05, such Borrower shall transmit to the Administrative Agent by telecopy a Competitive Bid Quote Request so as to be received no later than 11:30 A.M. (New York City time) at least (x) five Business Days prior to the Borrowing Date proposed therein, in the case of a Eurocurrency Auction, or (y) one Business Day prior to the Borrowing Date proposed therein, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, specifying in accordance with all of the terms of this Credit Agreement: (i) the proposed Borrowing Date for the proposed Competitive Bid Advance; (ii) the aggregate principal amount of such Competitive Bid Advance; (iii) whether the Competitive Bid Quotes requested are to set forth a Competitive Bid Margin or an Absolute Rate, or both; (iv) the Interest Period applicable thereto; and (v) the Borrower to which such proposed Competitive Bid Advance is to be made. A Borrower may request offers to make Competitive Bid Loans for more than one Interest Period and for a Eurocurrency Auction and an Absolute Rate Auction in a single Competitive Bid Quote Request. No Competitive Bid Quote Request shall be given within five Business Days (or upon reasonable prior notice to the Lenders, such other number of days as the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent may agree) of any other Competitive Bid Quote Request. Each Competitive Bid Quote Request shall be in a minimum amount of $25,000,000 or a larger multiple of $5,000,000. A Competitive Bid Quote Request that does not conform substantially to the format of Exhibit "B" hereto shall be rejected, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the applicable Borrower of such rejection by telecopy. (c) Invitation for Competitive Bid Quotes. Promptly upon receipt of a Competitive Bid Quote Request that is not rejected pursuant to Section 2.05(b), the Administrative Agent shall send to each of the Lenders by telecopy an Invitation for Competitive Bid Quotes which shall constitute an invitation by the applicable Borrower to each Lender to submit Competitive Bid Quotes offering to make the Competitive Bid Loans to which such Competitive Bid Quote Request relates in accordance with this Section 2.05. (d) Submission and Contents of Competitive Bid Quotes. (i) Each Lender may, in its sole discretion, submit a Competitive Bid Quote containing an offer or offers to make Competitive Bid Loans in response to any Invitation for Competitive Bid Quotes. Each Competitive Bid Quote must comply with the requirements of this Section 2.05(d) and must be submitted to the Administrative Agent by telecopy at its offices specified in or pursuant to Article 14 not later than (i) (A) 1:45 P.M. (New York City time) in the case of Citibank and (B) 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) in the case of each 30
other Lender, at least four Business Days prior to the proposed Borrowing Date in the case of a Eurocurrency Auction, or (ii) (A) 10:15 A.M. (New York City time) in the case of Citibank and (B) 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) in the case of each other Lender, on the proposed Borrowing Date in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction (or, in any such case upon reasonable prior notice to the Lenders, such other time and date as the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent may agree; provided that Citibank shall always be required to submit its Competitive Bid Quotes not less than fifteen minutes prior to the other Lenders). Subject to Articles 5 and 6, any Competitive Bid Quote so made shall be irrevocable except with the written consent of the Administrative Agent given on the instructions of the applicable Borrower. (i) Each Competitive Bid Quote shall in any case specify: (A) the proposed Borrowing Date, which shall be the same as that set forth in the applicable Invitation for Competitive Bid Quotes; (B) the principal amount of the Competitive Bid Loan for which each such offer is being made, (1) which principal amount may be greater than, less than or equal to the Commitment of the quoting Lender, but in no case greater than the unutilized Aggregate Commitment, (2) which principal amount must be at least $5,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000, and (3) which principal amount may not exceed the principal amount of Competitive Bid Loans for which offers were requested; (C) in the case of a Eurocurrency Auction, the Competitive Bid Margin offered for each such Competitive Bid Loan; (D) in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, the Absolute Rate offered for each such Competitive Bid Loan; (E) the applicable Interest Period; and (F) the identity of the quoting Lender. (ii) The Administrative Agent shall reject any Competitive Bid Quote that: (A) is not substantially in the form of Exhibit "D" hereto or does not specify all of the information required by Section 2.05(d)(i); (B) contains qualifying, conditional or similar language, other than any such language contained in Exhibit "D" hereto; (C) proposes terms other than or in addition to those set forth in the applicable Invitation for Competitive Bid Quotes; or 31
(D) arrives after the time set forth in Section 2.05(d)(i). (iii) If any Competitive Bid Quote shall be rejected pursuant to Section 2.05(d)(ii), then the Administrative Agent shall notify the relevant Lender of such rejection as soon as practicable. (e) Notice to Borrower. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the applicable Borrower of the terms (i) of any Competitive Bid Quote submitted by a Lender that is in accordance with Section 2.05 and (ii) of any Competitive Bid Quote that is in accordance with Section 2.05 and amends, modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a previous Competitive Bid Quote submitted by such Lender with respect to the same Competitive Bid Quote Request. Any such subsequent Competitive Bid Quote shall be disregarded by the Administrative Agent unless such subsequent Competitive Bid Quote specifically states that it is submitted solely to correct a manifest error in such former Competitive Bid Quote. The Administrative Agent's notice to the applicable Borrower shall specify the aggregate principal amount of Competitive Bid Loans for which offers have been received for each Interest Period specified in the related Competitive Bid Quote Request and the respective principal amounts and Competitive Bid Margins or Absolute Rates, as the case may be, so offered. (f) Acceptance and Notice by Borrower. Subject to the receipt of the notice from the Administrative Agent referred to in Section 2.05(e), not later than 11:30 A.M. (New York City time) (i) at least three Business Days prior to the proposed Borrowing Date, in the case of a Eurocurrency Auction or (ii) on the proposed Borrowing Date, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, the applicable Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such Borrower's acceptance or rejection of the offers so notified to it pursuant to Section 2.05(e); provided, however, that the failure by such Borrower to give such notice to the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be a rejection by such Borrower of all such offers. In the case of acceptance, such notice substantially in the form or Exhibit "L" hereto (a "Competitive Bid Borrowing Notice") shall specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for each Interest Period that are accepted. The applicable Borrower may accept or reject any Competitive Bid Quote in whole or in part; provided that: (i) the aggregate principal amount of each Competitive Bid Advance may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related Competitive Bid Quote Request; (ii) acceptance of offers may only be made on the basis of ascending Competitive Bid Margins or Absolute Rates, as the case may be; and (iii) the applicable Borrower may not accept any offer of the type described in Section 2.05(d)(ii) or that otherwise fails to comply with the requirements of this Credit Agreement for the purpose of obtaining a Competitive Bid Loan under this Credit Agreement. 32
(g) Allocation by the Administrative Agent. If offers are made by two or more Lenders with the same Competitive Bid Margins or Absolute Rates, as the case may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which offers are permitted to be accepted for the related Interest Period, the principal amount of Competitive Bid Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall be allocated by the Administrative Agent among such Lenders as nearly as possible (in such multiples of $1,000,000 as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of such offers. Allocations by the Administrative Agent of the amounts of Competitive Bid Loans shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall promptly, but in any event on the same Business Day in the case of Eurocurrency Bid Rate Advances, and by 12:30 P.M. (New York City time) on the same Business Day in the case of Absolute Rate Advances, notify each Lender of its receipt of a Competitive Bid Borrowing Notice and the aggregate principal amount of each Competitive Bid Advance allocated to each participating Lender. SECTION 2.06. FRONTED ADVANCE SUBFACILITY. (a) Fronted Advances. From and including the Closing Date and prior to the Termination Date, each Fronting Lender severally agrees, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Credit Agreement and notwithstanding the amount of Competitive Bid Loans made by such Fronting Lender, to make Fronted Loans to Whirlpool and Whirlpool Finance from time to time in amounts the Dollar Amount of which shall not exceed, in the aggregate at any one time outstanding, the amount of its Fronting Commitment. Each Fronted Advance hereunder shall consist of borrowings made from the several Fronting Lenders ratably in proportion to the ratio that their respective Fronting Commitments bear to the Aggregate Fronting Sublimit. The Fronted Advances shall be repaid as provided by the terms of Sections 2.02 and 2.06(f). (b) Types of Fronted Advances. The Fronted Advances shall be Fixed Rate Advances. (c) Reductions in Aggregate Fronting Sublimit. Whirlpool may permanently reduce the Aggregate Fronting Sublimit in whole, or in part ratably among the Fronting Lenders in integral multiples of $25,000,000, upon at least three Business Days' written notice to the Administrative Agent, which notice shall specify the amount of any such reduction; provided, however, that the amount of the Aggregate Fronting Sublimit may not be reduced below the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Fronted Advances. (d) Minimum Amount of Each Fronted Advance. Each Fronted Advance made or continued hereunder shall be in the minimum Dollar Amount of $25,000,000. (e) Method of Requesting New Fronted Advances. Whirlpool or Whirlpool Finance, as applicable, shall give the Fronting Agent, with a copy to the Administrative Agent, an irrevocable notice substantially in the form of Exhibit "K" hereto (a "Fronted Borrowing 33
Notice") not later than 9:30 a.m. (London, England time) on the Borrowing Date of each Fronted Advance. A Fronted Borrowing Notice shall in accordance with all the terms and conditions of this Credit Agreement specify: (i) the Borrower to which such Fronted Advance is to be made; (ii) the Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day, of such Fronted Advance; (iii) the Agreed Currency of such Fronted Advance; (iv) the aggregate amount of such Fronted Advance; and (v) the Interest Period of such Fronted Advance, which shall be for a period of one to seven days. (f) Payment and Participations of Fronted Advances. At the time that a Fronting Lender makes a Fronted Loan, each Lender (a "Purchasing Lender") shall be deemed, without any further action by any Person, to have purchased from such Fronting Lender an unfunded participation (ratably in proportion to the ratio that such Purchasing Lender's Commitment bears to the Aggregate Commitment), without recourse or warranty of such Fronting Lender, in such Fronted Loan. Whirlpool and Whirlpool Finance each agree to repay all Fronted Advances obtained by such Borrower on the earlier of (i) the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance or (ii) the Termination Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither Whirlpool nor Whirlpool Finance shall be permitted to request a new Fronted Advance to repay an outstanding Fronted Advance if the period from the date of the first outstanding Fronted Advance to the date of the repayment of the new Fronted Advance would exceed seven days. Each repayment of a Fronted Advance may be accomplished by requesting a Committed Advance, which request is not subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.03. In the event that Whirlpool or Whirlpool Finance, as applicable, shall fail to timely repay any Fronted Advance, and in any event upon (A) a request by the Fronting Agent, (B) the occurrence of a Default described in Section 8.05 or 8.06 or (C) the acceleration of any Obligations or termination of any Commitment pursuant to Section 9.01, each Purchasing Lender shall fund its participation in accordance with the preceding paragraph in such Fronted Advance (regardless of (1) whether the conditions precedent thereto set forth in Section 5.03 hereof are then satisfied, (2) whether or not Whirlpool or Whirlpool Finance, as applicable, has submitted a Committed Borrowing Notice and whether or not the Commitments are then in effect, (3) whether an Unmatured Default or a Default exists or (4) whether all the Obligations have been accelerated) and pay the proceeds thereof to the Fronting Agent, for the account of the Fronting Lenders, at the Fronting Agent's Eurocurrency Payment Office, or at such other Lending Installation of the Fronting Agent as may be specified in writing by the Fronting Agent, in the applicable Agreed Currency and in immediately available funds. If such amount is not in fact made available to the Fronting 34
Agent, for the account of the Fronting Lenders, by any Purchasing Lender, the Fronting Lenders shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Purchasing Lender, together with accrued interest thereon for each day from the date of demand thereof, if paid within two Business Days after demand at the Federal Funds Effective Rate and thereafter at the Alternate Base Rate. If a Purchasing Lender does not pay such amount forthwith as required by this Section 2.06(f), and until such time as such Purchasing Lender makes the required payment, the Fronting Lenders shall be deemed to continue to have outstanding Fronted Advances in the amount of such unpaid participation obligation for all purposes of the Loan Documents other than those provisions requiring the other Purchasing Lenders to purchase a participation therein. Further, such Purchasing Lender shall be deemed to have assigned any and all payments made of principal and interest on its Loans, and any other amounts due to it hereunder to the Fronting Lenders to fund Fronted Advances in the amount of the participation in Fronted Advances that such Purchasing Lender failed to purchase pursuant to this Section 2.06(f) until such amount has been purchased (as a result of such assignment or otherwise). SECTION 2.07. FEES. (a) Facility Fee. Whirlpool hereby agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, ratably in proportion to their Commitments, a facility fee at the Facility Fee Rate on the daily actual amount of the Aggregate Commitment (without regard to the outstanding principal amount of the Loans) for the period from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the Termination Date, which fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each Payment Date, commencing December 31, 2005, and on the Termination Date. (b) Utilization Fee. With respect to each day that the Dollar Amount of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Loans plus LOC Obligations exceeds the product of (i) one-half (1/2) times (ii) the Aggregate Commitment, Whirlpool hereby agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, ratably in proportion to their Commitments, a utilization fee at a per annum rate equal to the Utilization Fee Rate on the Dollar Amount of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans plus LOC Obligations on each such day, which fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each Payment Date, commencing December 31, 2005, and on the Termination Date. (c) Administration Fees. Whirlpool hereby agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent for their respective accounts such arrangement and administration fees as are heretofore and hereafter agreed upon in writing by Whirlpool and the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable. (d) Competitive Bid Fees. Upon submission of a Competitive Bid Quote Request to the Administrative Agent, the applicable Borrower hereby agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for its sole account an auction fee of $1,000. 35
(e) Letter of Credit Fees. (i) In consideration of the issuance of Letters of Credit hereunder, each Borrower hereby agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, an issuance fee on the actual daily maximum amount available to be drawn under each such Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower computed at a per annum rate for each day from the date of issuance to the date of expiration equal to the Eurocurrency Margin in effect from time to time; such issuance fee shall be allocated among the Lenders ratably in proportion to the ratio that their respective Commitments bear to the Aggregate Commitment and shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each Payment Date, commencing December 31, 2005, and on the Termination Date. (ii) In addition to the issuance fee payable pursuant to clause (i) above, each Borrower hereby agrees to pay to the Issuing Lender, without sharing by the other Lenders (A) a letter of credit fronting fee of 0.125% on the actual daily maximum amount available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower computed at a per annum rate for each day from the date of issuance to the date of expiration (which fronting fee shall be shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each Payment Date, commencing December 31, 2005, and on the Termination Date) and (B) the customary charges from time to time of the Issuing Lender with respect to the issuance, amendment, transfer, administration, cancellation and conversion of, and drawings under, such Letters of Credit. (f) Fronting Fees. Whirlpool hereby agrees to pay to the Fronting Agent, for the account of the Fronting Lenders, ratably in proportion to their Fronting Commitments, a fronting fee at a per annum rate equal to 0.125% on the Dollar Amount of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Fronted Loans on each such day, which fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each Payment Date, commencing December 31, 2005, and on the Termination Date. SECTION 2.08. GENERAL FACILITY TERMS. (a) Method of Borrowing. On each Borrowing Date, each applicable Lender shall make available its Loan or Loans, if any, in the requested Agreed Currency, (i) if such Loan is denominated in Dollars, not later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent, at its address specified in or pursuant to Article 14, (ii) if such Loan (other than a Fronted Loan) is denominated in another currency, not later than 12:00 noon, local time in the city of the Administrative Agent's Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency, in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent, at the Administrative Agent's Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency and (iii) if such Loan is a Fronted Loan, not later than 12:00 noon (London, England time), in funds immediately available to the Fronting Agent, at the Fronting Agent's Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency. The Administrative Agent or Fronting Agent, as applicable, will make the funds so received from the applicable Lenders available to the applicable 36
Borrower at the Administrative Agent's or Fronting Agent's aforesaid address, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.08(a), to the extent that a Loan made by a Lender matures on the Borrowing Date of a requested Loan denominated in the same Agreed Currency as that of the maturing Loan, such Lender shall apply the proceeds of the Loan it is then making to the repayment of principal of the maturing Loan. (b) Prepayments. (i) Optional Prepayments. Each Borrower may from time to time prepay all of its outstanding Floating Rate Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of $5,000,000 (and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 if in excess thereof), any portion of the outstanding Floating Rate Advances upon one Business Day's prior notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Borrower may from time to time prepay all of its outstanding Eurocurrency Committed Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate Dollar Amount of $5,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 if in excess thereof, any portion of the outstanding Eurocurrency Committed Advances upon three Business Days' prior notice to the Administrative Agent. Whirlpool or Whirlpool Finance, as applicable, may from time to time prepay all of its outstanding Fronted Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate Dollar Amount of $5,000,000, any portion of the outstanding Fronted Advances upon three Business Days' prior notice to the Fronting Agent (with a copy to the Administrative Agent). No Competitive Bid Loan may be prepaid prior to the last day of its applicable Interest Period without the prior consent of the Lender holding such Competitive Bid Loan, which consent may be given or withheld at such Lender's sole and absolute discretion. Any such prepayment pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.08 of a Eurocurrency Committed Advance, a Fronted Advance or a Competitive Bid Loan prior to the end of its applicable Interest Period shall be subject to the provisions of Section 3.05. (ii) Mandatory Prepayments. (A) Aggregate Commitment. If at any time, the sum of the Dollar Amount of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Advances plus LOC Obligations shall exceed the Aggregate Commitment, the Borrowers immediately shall prepay outstanding Advances and (after all Advances have been repaid) cash collateralize LOC Obligations, in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess. (B) LOC Committed Amount. If at any time, the sum of the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount of LOC Obligations shall exceed the LOC Committed Amount, the Borrowers immediately shall cash collateralize LOC Obligations in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess. (C) Aggregate Fronting Sublimit. If at any time, the Dollar Amount of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Fronted Advances shall exceed the Aggregate Fronting Sublimit, the Borrowers immediately shall prepay outstanding Fronted Advances in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess. 37
(c) Interest Rates; Interest Periods. Subject to Section 2.08(d), (i) each Floating Rate Advance (and each Floating Rate Loan making up such Floating Rate Advance) shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and including the date such Advance is made or is converted from a Eurocurrency Committed Advance pursuant to Section 2.03(f) to but excluding the date it is paid or is converted into a Eurocurrency Committed Advance pursuant to Section 2.03(f), at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate for such day, (ii) each Eurocurrency Committed Advance (and each Eurocurrency Loan making up such Eurocurrency Committed Advance) shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day of each Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate determined pursuant hereto as applicable to such Eurocurrency Committed Advance for each day during such Interest Period, (iii) each Fronted Advance (and each Fronted Loan making up such Fronted Advance) shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day of each Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate determined pursuant hereto as applicable to such Fronted Advance for each day during such Interest Period, (iv) each Absolute Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Absolute Rate determined pursuant hereto as applicable to such Absolute Rate Loan, and (v) each Eurocurrency Bid Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Bid Rate determined pursuant hereto as applicable to such Eurocurrency Bid Rate Loan. Changes in the rate of interest on each Floating Rate Advance will take effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate. No Interest Period shall end after the Termination Date. (d) Rate after Certain Defaults. (i) During the existence of any Default (other than pursuant to Section 8.02(i)), the Required Lenders may, at their option by notice to the Borrowers, declare that each Advance and the issuance fees on each outstanding Letter of Credit shall bear interest or accrue an issuance fee, respectively, at a rate per annum equal to the rate otherwise applicable to such Advance or such fee plus 1% per annum. (ii) During the existence of any Default under Section 8.02(i), each Advance (and each Loan making up such Advance) not paid when due, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and any reimbursement obligation arising from any Letter of 38
Credit not paid when due shall, in each case, bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and including the date such Advance matures (or the date such reimbursement obligation arises), whether by acceleration or otherwise, to but excluding the date it is paid, at the rate otherwise applicable to such Advance plus 2% per annum or, if no rate is applicable, the Alternate Base Rate plus 2% per annum, payable on demand. (iii) During the existence of any Default, the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the Borrowers, declare that no Advance may be converted into or continued as a Dollar-denominated Eurocurrency Committed Advance. (e) Interest Payment Dates; Interest Basis. Interest accrued on each Floating Rate Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof, on any date on which such Floating Rate Advance is prepaid or converted, whether due to acceleration or otherwise, at maturity and thereafter on demand. Subject to the next sentence, interest accrued on each Fixed Rate Advance shall be payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which such Fixed Rate Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or otherwise, at maturity and thereafter on demand. Interest accrued on each Fixed Rate Advance having an Interest Period longer than three months shall also be payable on the last day of each 90 day interval (in the case of Absolute Rate Advances) or three-month interval (in the case of Eurocurrency Committed Advances or Eurocurrency Bid Rate Advances) during such Interest Period. Interest on all Fixed Rate Advances (other than Fixed Rate Advances denominated in Sterling), all Floating Rate Advances which bear interest based on the Federal Funds Effective Rate and all fees due hereunder shall be calculated for the actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year. Interest on all Fixed Rate Advances denominated in Sterling shall be calculated for the actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a 365/366 day year. Interest on all Floating Rate Advances which bear interest based on the Prime Rate shall be calculated for the actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a 365, or when appropriate 366, day year. Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior to noon (local time) at the place of payment. If any payment of principal of, or interest on, an Advance or of fees due hereunder shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in connection with such payment. Each Borrower promises to pay interest on its respective Advances as provided in this Section 2.08(e). (f) Method of Payment. (i) General. Each Advance and each reimbursement obligation with respect to a drawing under a Letter of Credit shall be paid, repaid or prepaid in the currency in which such Advance or the related drawing was made in the amount borrowed or paid and interest payable thereon shall be paid in such currency. Subject 39
to the last sentence of Section 2.08(a), (A) all amounts of principal, interest, fees and other Obligations payable by the Borrowers in Dollars under the Loan Documents (other than in respect of Fronted Advances) shall be made in Dollars by 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date when due in funds immediately available, without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff, to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's address specified pursuant to Article 14, or at such other Lending Installation of the Administrative Agent as may be specified in writing by the Administrative Agent to the Borrowers, (B) all amounts of principal and interest payable by Whirlpool or Whirlpool Finance, as applicable, with respect to Fronted Advances shall be made in the applicable currency by 12:00 noon (London, England time or, in the case of amounts payable in Dollars, New York time) on the date when due, in funds immediately available, without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff, for the account of the Fronting Agent, at the Fronting Agent's Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency and (C) all other amounts of principal, interest and other Obligations payable by the Borrowers in any currency other than Dollars under the Loan Documents shall be made in such currency by 12:00 noon (local time) on the date when due, in funds immediately available, without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff, for the account of the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, at its Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency. Prior to the existence of a Default, all amounts due hereunder and all payments of reimbursement obligations arising from drawings under Letters of Credit shall be made ratably among the applicable Lenders in the case of payments of principal or interest in respect of Competitive Bid Advances and ratably among all of the Lenders in the case of all other payments (other than reimbursement obligations under Letters of Credit paid to and fronting fees retained by the Issuing Lender for its own account, payments of principal and interest in respect of Fronted Advances (which are subject to Section 2.08(f)(ii) below) and fronting fees retained by the Fronting Lenders for their own accounts, the administrative and auction fees retained by the Administrative Agent for its own account and the administrative fee retained by the Fronting Agent for its own account). Except as provided in Section 9.01(b), during the existence of any Default, all payments of principal due hereunder and all payments of reimbursement obligations arising from drawings under Letters of Credit shall be applied ratably among all outstanding Advances and Participation Interests. Each payment delivered to the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, for the account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly, but in any event not later than the close of business on the date received by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, if received by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, by 12:00 noon (local time), by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, to such Lender in the same type and currency of funds which the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, received at such Lender's address specified pursuant to Article 14 or at any Lending Installation specified by such Lender in a written notice received by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable. If the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as 40
applicable, shall fail to pay any Lender the amount due such Lender pursuant to this Section when due, the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, shall be obligated to pay to such Lender interest on the amount that should have been paid hereunder for each day from the date such amount shall have become due until the date such amount is paid at the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.08(f), if, after the making of any Advance or issuance of any Letter of Credit in any currency other than Dollars, currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency with the result that different types of such currency (the "New Currency") are introduced and the type of currency in which the Advance was made or such Letter of Credit was issued (the "Original Currency") no longer exists or the applicable Borrower is not able to make payment to the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, for the account of the applicable Lenders in such Original Currency, then all payments to be made by such Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document in such currency shall be made in such amount and such type of the New Currency as shall be equivalent (based upon market value) to the amount of such payment otherwise due hereunder or under such Loan Document in the Original Currency, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrowers take all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.08(f), if, after the making of any Advance or issuance of any Letter of Credit in any currency other than Dollars, the applicable Borrower is not able to make payment to the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, for the account of the applicable Lenders in the type of currency in which such Advance was made or such Letter of Credit was issued (or in any New Currency as set forth above) because of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulation, then such Advance or reimbursement obligations shall instead be repaid when due in Dollars in a principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount (as of the date of repayment) of such Advance or such reimbursement obligations. In the event any amount paid to any Lender hereunder is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, each Lender shall, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, repay to the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, the amount so paid to such Lender, with interest for the period commencing on the date such payment is returned by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, until the date the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, receives such repayment at a rate per annum equal to, during the period to but excluding the date two Business Days after such request, the Federal Funds Effective Rate, and thereafter, the Alternate Base Rate plus two percent (2%) per annum. (ii) Allocation Among the Lenders of Payments Received in Respect of Fronted Loans and Fronted Advances. Each Fronting Lender shall receive, for its own account, all payments or prepayments of principal with respect to its Fronted Loans; provided, however, upon the funding of the Purchasing Lenders' Participation Interests with respect to a Fronted Loan pursuant 41
to Section 2.06(f), such Purchasing Lenders shall be deemed Fronting Lenders with respect to such Fronted Loan and shall be entitled to receive their pro rata share of any payment or prepayment of principal with respect to such Fronted Loan. Until the Purchasing Lenders are required to fund their Participation Interest in a Funded Loan, subject to Section 2.08(d), (i) the Fronting Lender that made such Fronted Loan shall receive interest on such Fronted Loan equal to (A) the Eurocurrency Base Rate for such Fronted Loan plus (B) its ratable share of the Eurocurrency Margin (in proportion to the ratio that its Commitment bears to the Aggregate Commitment) for such Fronted Loan plus (C) its MLA Cost for such Fronted Loan and (ii) each Purchasing Lender shall receive interest on such Fronted Loan in an amount equal to its ratable share of the Eurocurrency Margin (in proportion to the ratio that its Commitments bear to the Aggregate Commitment) for such Fronted Loan. After the Purchasing Lenders fund their Participation Interests in a Fronted Loan, subject to Section 2.08(d), each Fronting Lender with respect to such Fronted Loan shall receive interest on such Fronted Loan equal to (A) the Eurocurrency Base Rate for such Fronted Loan plus (B) its ratable share of the Eurocurrency Margin for such Fronted Loan plus (C) its MLA Cost for such Fronted Loan. For purposes of clarification, this Section 2.08(f)(ii) is intended to address the allocation among the Lenders of payments of principal and interest on Fronted Loans and Fronted Advances received from the Borrowers and is not intended to create any additional obligation of any Borrower hereunder. (g) Evidence of Debt; Telephonic Notices. Each Lender is hereby authorized to record in accordance with its usual practice, the date, the currency, the amount and the maturity of each of its Loans made hereunder; provided, however, that any failure to so record shall not affect any Borrower's obligations under this Credit Agreement. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent such Lender's Loans shall be evidenced by a Note. Except as otherwise set forth herein, each Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to extend or continue Advances, effect selections of Types of Advances and transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any Person or Persons the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent or any Lender reasonably believes to be an Authorized Representative. If requested by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, or any Lender, each Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, a written confirmation of each telephonic notice given by it signed by an Authorized Representative. If the written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent and the Lenders shall govern absent manifest error. (h) Notification of Advances, Interest Rates and Prepayments. Promptly after receipt thereof, (i) the Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice, Aggregate Fronting Sublimit reduction notice, Committed Borrowing Notice, Dollar Continuation/Conversion Notice, Non-Dollar Continuation Conversion Notice, Competitive Bid Borrowing 42
Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder and (ii) the Fronting Agent will notify each Fronting Lender of the contents of each Fronted Borrowing Notice and repayment notice received by it hereunder. In addition, (A) with respect to each Committed Borrowing Notice, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of its pro rata share of the Advance to be made pursuant to such Committed Borrowing Notice and (B) with respect to each Fronted Borrowing Notice, the Fronting Agent shall notify each Fronting Lender of its pro rata share of the Advance to be made pursuant to such Fronted Borrowing Notice. The Administrative Agent will notify the applicable Borrower and each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Fixed Rate Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give each Borrower and each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent's failure to give any such notice will not affect any Borrower's obligation to pay interest to the Lenders at the applicable interest rate. The Fronting Agent will notify Whirlpool, Whirlpool Finance and each Fronting Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Fronted Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate; provided, however, that the Fronting Agent's failure to give any such notice will not affect Whirlpool's or Whirlpool Finance's obligation to pay interest to the Fronting Lenders at the applicable interest rate. (i) Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent. Unless the applicable Borrower or Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, prior to the date on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, of (i) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a Loan or (ii) in the case of a Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or fees to the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, for the account of the applicable Lenders, that it does not intend to make such scheduled payment, the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, may assume that such scheduled payment has been made. The Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such scheduled payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If such Lender or Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such scheduled payment to the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, the recipient of such scheduled payment shall, on demand by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, repay to the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, until the date the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of such a repayment due from a Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day, or (y) in the case of such a repayment due from a Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan. (j) Market Disruption. Notwithstanding the satisfaction of all conditions referred to in Article 5 with respect to any Advance or any Letter of Credit in any currency other than Dollars, if there shall occur on or prior to the date of such Advance or issuance of such 43
Letter of Credit any change in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls which would in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders make it impracticable for the Eurocurrency Committed Loans or Fronted Loans, as applicable, comprising such Advance or such Letter of Credit to be denominated in the currency specified by the applicable Borrower, then the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to such Borrower and the Lenders, and such Loans or such Letter of Credit shall not be denominated in such currency but shall, in the case of Eurocurrency Committed Loans, be made on such Borrowing Date as Floating Rate Loans or issued on such date in Dollars, in the case of Letters of Credit, be issued on such date in Dollars and, in the case of Fronted Loans, be made on such Borrowing Date as Fixed Rate Loans on such date in Dollars, in an aggregate principal amount or face amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount or face amount specified in the related Committed Borrowing Notice, LOC Documents or Fronted Borrowing Notice, as applicable, unless such Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least one Business Day before such date that it elects not to borrow or have such Letter of Credit issued on such date. (k) Lending Installations. Subject to Section 3.06, each Lender may (i) from time to time book its Loans at any Lending Installation(s) selected by such Lender, and (ii) by written or telecopy notice to the Administrative Agent (and, if applicable, the Fronting Agent) and the Borrowers, designate (or change any such prior designation) a Lending Installation through which Loans of a particular Type will be made by it and for whose account payments on such Loans are to be made. All terms of this Credit Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and any Notes of a Lender shall be deemed held by such Lender for the benefit of its appropriate Lending Installation. Each Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (and, if applicable, the Fronting Agent) and Whirlpool on or prior to the date of this Credit Agreement of the Lending Installation which it intends to utilize for each Type and currency of Loan hereunder. (l) Withholding Tax Exemption. (i) Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof shall: (A) (1) on or before the date of any payment by a Borrower incorporated in the United States under this Credit Agreement to such Lender, deliver to the Borrowers incorporated in the United States and the Administrative Agent two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or successor applicable form, as the case may be, certifying that it is entitled to receive payments under this Credit Agreement, including any fees, without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes; (2) deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent two further copies of any such form or certification on or before the date that any such form or certification expires or becomes obsolete and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Borrowers; and 44
(3) obtain such extensions of time for filing and complete such forms or certifications as may reasonably be requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent; or (B) in the case of any such Lender that is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (1) represent to the Borrowers (for the benefit of the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent) that it is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (2) agree to furnish to the Borrowers, on or before the date of any payment by the Borrowers, with a copy to the Administrative Agent, two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or successor applicable form certifying to such Lender's legal entitlement at the date of such certificate to an exemption from U.S. withholding tax under the provisions of Section 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments to be made under this Credit Agreement (and to deliver to the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent two further copies of such form on or before the date it expires or becomes obsolete and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recently provided form and, if necessary, obtain any extensions of time reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent for filing and completing such forms), and (3) agree, to the extent legally entitled to do so, upon reasonable request by the Borrowers, to provide to the Borrowers (for the benefit of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent) such other forms as may be reasonably required in order to establish the legal entitlement of such Lender to an exemption from withholding with respect to payments under this Credit Agreement; provided, that any Lender that delivers the forms and representation provided in this clause (B) must also deliver to the Borrower or Administrative Agent two accurate, complete and signed copies of either Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or, in each case, an applicable successor form, establishing a complete exemption from withholding of United States federal income tax imposed on the payment of any fees, if applicable, to such Lender. Notwithstanding the above, if any change in treaty, law or regulation has occurred after the date such Person becomes a Lender hereunder which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Lender so advises the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent then such Lender shall be exempt from such requirements. Each Person that shall become a Lender or a participant of a Lender pursuant to Section 13.02 or 13.03 shall, upon the effectiveness of the related transfer, be required to provide all of the forms, certifications and statements required pursuant to this subsection (i); provided that in the case of a participant of a Lender, the obligations of such participant of a Lender pursuant to this subsection (i) shall be determined as if the participant of a Lender were a Lender except that such participant of a Lender shall furnish all such required forms, certifications and statements to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased. 45
(ii) If any withholding, deduction or other taxes (whether United States, Netherlands or otherwise) shall be or become applicable after the date of this Credit Agreement to any payments by the Borrowers to a Lender hereunder, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to make, fund or maintain the Loan or Loans, as the case may be, through another lending office located in another jurisdiction so as to reduce, to the fullest extent possible, the Borrowers' liability hereunder, if the making, funding or maintenance of such Loan or Loans through such other office does not, in the reasonable judgment of the Lender, materially affect the Lender of such Loan. (m) Allocation of the Aggregate Commitment Among the Borrowers. The Borrowers understand and agree that (i) subject to the terms and conditions of this Credit Agreement, the Lenders will honor Committed Borrowing Notices, Competitive Bid Borrowing Notices, requests for the issuance of Letters of Credit and Fronted Borrowing Notices in the order received by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, and (ii) as a result, one or more of the Borrowers may be unable to borrow or increase borrowings hereunder if other Borrowers have already borrowed hereunder in amounts which have caused the Dollar Amount of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans plus the outstanding LOC Obligations to equal the Aggregate Commitment. SECTION 2.09. BORROWING SUBSIDIARIES; ADDITIONAL BORROWING SUBSIDIARIES. Whirlpool may at any time or from time to time, with the consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, designate any of its Subsidiaries (other than any Subsidiary having its seat or its center of management in Austria) to become an "Additional Borrowing Subsidiary" (and thereby a "Borrowing Subsidiary" and a "Borrower") hereunder by satisfying the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.02. Upon satisfaction of such conditions precedent such Subsidiary shall for all purposes be a party hereto as a Borrower as fully as if it had executed and delivered this Credit Agreement. So long as the principal of and interest on any Advances made to any Borrowing Subsidiary under this Credit Agreement and any LOC Obligations of such Borrowing Subsidiary shall have been repaid or paid in full and all other obligations of such Borrowing Subsidiary under this Credit Agreement shall have been fully performed (and all Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Borrowing Subsidiary have been fully cash-collateralized to the satisfaction of the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender), Whirlpool may, by not less than five Business Days' prior notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders thereof), terminate such Borrowing Subsidiary's status as a Borrower hereunder; provided, however, that Whirlpool shall concurrently terminate, if applicable, the status as a Borrower hereunder of any Subsidiary of the terminated Borrowing Subsidiary. 46
SECTION 2.10. REGULATION D COMPENSATION. Each Lender may require each Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on its Eurocurrency Committed Loans and Fronted Loans, additional interest on the related Eurocurrency Committed Loan or Fronted Loan of such Lender at a rate per annum determined by such Lender up to but not exceeding the excess of (i) (A) the Eurocurrency Base Rate then in effect for such Loan divided by (B) one minus the Reserve Requirement applicable to such Lender over (ii) such Eurocurrency Base Rate. Any Lender wishing to require payment of such additional interest (x) shall so notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, in which case such additional interest on the Eurocurrency Committed Loans or Fronted Loans of such Lender to such Borrower shall be payable to such Lender at the place indicated in such notice with respect to each Interest Period commencing at least three Business Days after the giving of such notice and (y) shall notify such Borrower at least five Business Days prior to each date on which interest is payable on its Eurocurrency Committed Loans or Fronted Loans of the amount then due such Lender under this Section. ARTICLE 3 CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES SECTION 3.01. TAXES. (a) Payments to be Free and Clear. Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.01(c), all sums payable by each Borrower under the Loan Documents, whether in respect of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be paid without deduction for any present and future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings imposed by any government or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof (but excluding franchise taxes and any tax imposed on or measured by the net income, receipts, profits or gains of any Lender) and all interest, penalties or similar liabilities with respect thereto (collectively, "Taxes"), which amounts shall be paid by the applicable Borrower as provided in Section 3.01(b) below. The applicable Borrower will pay each Lender the amounts necessary such that the net amount of the principal, interest, fees or other sums received and retained by each Lender is not less than the amount payable under this Credit Agreement. (b) Grossing-up of Payments. Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.01(c), if: (i) any Borrower or any other Person is required by law to make any deduction or withholding on account of any Taxes from any sum paid or expressed to be payable by such Borrower to any Lender under this Credit Agreement, or (ii) any party to this Credit Agreement (or any Person on its behalf) other than a Borrower is required by law to deduct or withhold any Tax from, or make a payment of Taxes with respect to, any such sum received or receivable by any Lender under this Credit Agreement: (A) the applicable party shall notify the Administrative Agent and, if such party is not the applicable Borrower, the Administrative Agent will notify the applicable Borrower of any such requirement or any change in any such requirement as soon as such party becomes aware of it; 47
(B) the applicable Borrower shall pay all Taxes before the date on which penalties attached thereto become due and payable, such payment to be made (if the liability to pay is imposed on such Borrower) for its own account or (if that liability is imposed on any other party to this Credit Agreement) on behalf of and in the name of that party; (C) the sum payable by the applicable Borrower in respect of which the relevant deduction, withholding or payment is required shall (except, in the case of any such payment, to the extent that the amount thereof is not ascertainable when that sum is paid) be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of that deduction, withholding or payment, that party receives on the due date and retains (free from any liability in respect of any such deduction, withholding or payment of Taxes) a sum equal to that which it would have received and so retained had no such deduction, withholding or payment of Taxes been required or made; and (D) within thirty days after payment of any sum from which the applicable Borrower is required by law to make any deduction or withholding of Taxes, and within thirty days after the due date of payment of any Tax or other amount which it is required to pay pursuant to the foregoing subsection (B) of this Section 3.01(b), the applicable Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent all such certified documents and other evidence as to the making of such deduction, withholding or payment as (x) are satisfactory to the affected parties as proof of such deduction, withholding or payment and of the remittance thereof to the relevant taxing or other authority, and (y) are required by any such party to enable it to claim a tax credit with respect to such deduction, withholding or payment. (c) Conditions to Gross-up. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 3.01 to the contrary, no Borrower shall have any obligation to pay any Taxes pursuant to this Section 3.01, or to pay any amount to the Administrative Agent or any Lender pursuant to this Section 3.01, to the extent that such amount results from the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent or Fronting Agent to comply with its obligations pursuant to Section 2.08(l) or Section 13.05. (d) Refunds. If any Lender receives a refund in respect of Taxes paid by any Borrower, it shall promptly pay such refund, together with any other amounts paid by such Borrower pursuant to Section 3.01 in connection with such refunded Taxes, to such Borrower, provided that such Borrower agrees to promptly return such refund to the applicable Lender after it receives notice from the applicable Lender that it is required to repay such refund. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to require any Lender to disclose confidential tax information. 48
SECTION 3.02. INCREASED COSTS. If, at any time after the date of this Credit Agreement, the adoption of any applicable law or the application of any applicable governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof, or the compliance of any Lender therewith, (i) imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve, assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation (other than amounts paid pursuant to Section 2.10 and other than reserves and assessments taken into account in determining the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency Committed Advances or Fronted Advances), or (ii) imposes any other condition (not being included within the Taxes covered by Section 3.01), the result of which is to increase the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation of making, funding or maintaining Eurocurrency Loans or Letters of Credit or reduces any amount receivable by any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation in connection with Eurocurrency Loans or Letters of Credit, or requires any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of Eurocurrency Loans held or interest received by it, by an amount deemed material by such Lender, then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender, the applicable Borrower or Whirlpool shall pay such Lender that portion of such increased expense incurred or reduction in an amount received which such Lender determines is attributable to making, funding and maintaining its Eurocurrency Loans or Letters of Credit and its Commitment to make Eurocurrency Loans or issue or participate in Letters of Credit; provided, however, that any amount payable pursuant to this Section 3.02 shall be limited to the amount incurred from and after the date one hundred fifty days prior to the date that such Lender makes such demand; and provided, further, that any amount payable pursuant to this Section 3.02 shall be paid by the applicable Borrower to the extent that such amount is reasonably allocable to such Borrower and the Advances made to it and shall otherwise be payable by Whirlpool. SECTION 3.03. CHANGES IN CAPITAL ADEQUACY REGULATIONS. If a Lender determines that the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender, any Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender is increased as a result of a Change (as hereafter defined), then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the applicable Borrower or Whirlpool shall pay such Lender the amount which such Lender reasonably determines is necessary to compensate it for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such increased capital which such Lender determines is attributable to this Credit Agreement, its Loans, its Letters of Credit or its obligation to make Loans or issue Letters of Credit hereunder (after taking into account such Lender's policies as to capital adequacy); provided, however, that any amount payable pursuant to this Section 3.03 shall be limited to the amount incurred from and after the date one hundred fifty days prior to the date that 49
such Lender makes such demand; and provided, further, that any amount payable pursuant to this Section 3.02 shall be paid by the applicable Borrower to the extent that such amount is reasonably allocable to such Borrower and the Advances made to it and shall otherwise be payable by Whirlpool. "Change" means (i) any change after the date of this Credit Agreement in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines (as hereafter defined), or (ii) any adoption of or change in any other law, governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline, interpretation, or directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the date of this Credit Agreement which affects the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any Lender or any Lending Installation or any corporation controlling any Lender. "Risk-Based Capital Guidelines" means (x) the risk-based capital guidelines in effect in the United States on the date of this Credit Agreement, including transition rules, and (y) the corresponding capital regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities outside the United States in effect on the date of this Credit Agreement, including transition rules. SECTION 3.04. AVAILABILITY OF TYPES AND CURRENCIES. If any Lender determines that maintenance at a suitable Lending Installation of any Type of its Eurocurrency Loans or any Letter of Credit denominated in any Agreed Currency would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation or directive, whether or not having the force of law, and notifies the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent of such determination, then the affected currency shall cease to be an Agreed Currency and the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent shall suspend the availability of the affected Type and currency of Advance and Letters of Credit and, if such Lender determines that it is necessary, require that any Eurocurrency Loan of the affected Type and currency be repaid or any Letters of Credit denominated in the affected currency be cash collateralized. If any Lender determines that deposits of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurocurrency Committed Advances or Fronted Advances denominated in any Agreed Currency are not available, then the affected currency shall cease to be an Agreed Currency and the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent shall suspend the availability of Eurocurrency Committed Advances or Fronted Advances denominated in the affected currency. If any Lender determines that the combination of the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency Committed Advances, Letters of Credit and Fronted Advances denominated in any Agreed Currency and payments due pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.02 with respect to such Eurocurrency Committed Advances, such Letters of Credit or such Fronted Advances does not accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining Eurocurrency Committed Advances, Letters of Credit and Fronted Advances in the affected currency, then the affected currency shall cease to be an Agreed Currency and the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent shall suspend the availability of Eurocurrency Committed Advances, Letters of Credit and Fronted Advances denominated in the affected currency. SECTION 3.05. FUNDING INDEMNIFICATION. If any payment of a Fixed Rate Loan occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period, whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a Fixed Rate Loan is not made on the date specified by the applicable Borrower for any reason other than default by a Lender, such Borrower will indemnify each Lender for any loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, any loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain such Fixed Rate Loan (but excluding loss of profits). 50
SECTION 3.06. MITIGATION OF ADDITIONAL COSTS OR ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES. If, in respect of any Lender, circumstances arise which would or would upon the giving of notice result in: (i) an increase in the liability of a Borrower to such Lender under Section 3.01, 3.02 or 3.03; (ii) the unavailability of a Type or currency of Committed Advance or Fronted Advance under Section 3.04; or (iii) a Lender being unable to deliver the forms required by Section 2.08(l); then, without in any way limiting, reducing or otherwise qualifying the applicable Borrower's obligations under any of the Sections referred to above in this Section 3.06, such Lender shall promptly upon becoming aware of the same notify the Administrative Agent thereof and shall, in consultation with the Administrative Agent and Whirlpool and to the extent that it can do so without disadvantaging itself, take such reasonable steps as may be reasonably open to it to mitigate the effects of such circumstances (including, without limitation, the designation of an alternate Lending Installation or the transfer of its Loans to another Lending Installation). If and so long as a Lender has been unable to take, or has not taken, steps acceptable to Whirlpool to mitigate the effect of the circumstances in question, such Lender shall be obliged, at the request and expense of Whirlpool, to assign all its rights and obligations hereunder to another Person nominated by Whirlpool with the approval of the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Lender (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) and willing to participate in the facility in place of such Lender; provided that (i) all obligations owed to such assigning Lender (including, if such Lender is the Issuing Lender, the cancellation or replacement of or other accommodation with respect to outstanding Letters of Credit in a manner satisfactory to it) shall be paid in full and (ii) such Person satisfies all of the requirements of this Credit Agreement including, but not limited to, providing the forms required by Sections 2.08(l) and 13.03(b). Notwithstanding any such assignment, the obligations of the Borrowers under Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03 and 10.06 shall survive any such assignment and be enforceable by such Lender. SECTION 3.07. LENDER STATEMENTS; SURVIVAL OF INDEMNITY. Each Lender shall deliver to the applicable Borrower and Whirlpool a written statement of such Lender as to the amount due, if any, under Section 3.01, 3.02, 3.03 or 3.05. Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the applicable Borrower in the absence of manifest error. Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a Fixed Rate Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded its Fixed Rate Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the Fixed Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written statement shall be payable within 15 days after receipt by the applicable Borrower and Whirlpool of the written statement. The obligations of any Borrower under Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03 or 3.05 shall survive payment of any other of such Borrower's Obligations and the termination of this Credit Agreement. 51
ARTICLE 4 GUARANTY SECTION 4.01. GUARANTY. For valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, and to induce the Lenders to make Advances and issue or participate in Letters of Credit to each of the Borrowing Subsidiaries, Whirlpool hereby irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally guarantees prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of any and all existing and future obligations of each of the Borrowing Subsidiaries to the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, under or with respect to the Loan Documents, whether for principal, interest (including, without limitation, all interest accruing subsequent to the commencement of any case, proceeding or other action relating to any Borrowing Subsidiary under the Bankruptcy Code or any similar law with respect to the bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of any Borrowing Subsidiary, and all interest which, but for any such case, proceeding or other action would otherwise accrue), fees, expenses or otherwise (collectively, the "Guaranteed Obligations"). Whirlpool also agrees that all payments under this guaranty shall be made in the same currency and manner as provided herein for the Guaranteed Obligations. SECTION 4.02. WAIVERS. Whirlpool waives notice of the acceptance of this guaranty and of the extension or continuation of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof. Whirlpool further waives presentment, protest, notice of notices delivered or demand made on any Borrowing Subsidiary or action or delinquency in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, including any right to require the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent and the Lenders to sue any Borrowing Subsidiary, any other guarantor or any other Person obligated with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, or otherwise to enforce payment thereof against any collateral securing the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof. SECTION 4.03. GUARANTY ABSOLUTE. This guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not of collection, it is a primary obligation of Whirlpool and not one of surety, and the validity and enforceability of this guaranty shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and shall not be impaired or affected by, any of the following: (a) any extension, modification or renewal of, or indulgence with respect to, or substitutions for, the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto at any time; (b) any failure or omission to enforce 52
any right, power or remedy with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto, or any collateral; (c) any waiver of any right, power or remedy or of any default with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto, or any collateral; (d) any release, surrender, compromise, settlement, waiver, subordination or modification, with or without consideration, of any collateral, any other guaranties with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, or any other obligation of any Person with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (e) the enforceability or validity of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or the genuineness, enforceability or validity of any agreement relating thereto or with respect to any collateral; (f) the application of payments received from any source to the payment of obligations other than the Guaranteed Obligations, any part thereof or amounts which are not covered by this guaranty even though the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent and the Lenders might lawfully have elected to apply such payments to any part or all of the Guaranteed Obligations or to amounts which are not covered by this guaranty; (g) any change in the ownership of any Borrowing Subsidiary or the insolvency, bankruptcy or any other change in the legal status of any Borrowing Subsidiary; (h) the change in or the imposition of any law, decree, regulation or other governmental act which does or might impair, delay or in any way affect the validity, enforceability or payment when due of the Guaranteed Obligations; (i) the failure of Whirlpool or any Borrowing Subsidiary to maintain in full force, validity or effect or to obtain or renew when required all governmental and other approvals, licenses or consents required in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations or this guaranty, or to take any other action required in connection with the performance of all obligations pursuant to the Guaranteed Obligations or this guaranty; (j) the existence of any claim, setoff or other rights which Whirlpool may have at any time against any Borrowing Subsidiary, or any other Person in connection herewith or an unrelated transaction; or (k) any other circumstances, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, which could constitute a defense to a guarantor; all whether or not Whirlpool shall have had notice or knowledge of any act or omission referred to in the foregoing clauses (a) through (k) of this Section 4.03. It is agreed that Whirlpool's liability hereunder is several and independent of any other guaranties or other obligations at any time in effect with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof and that Whirlpool's liability hereunder may be enforced regardless of the existence, validity, enforcement or non-enforcement of any such other guaranties or other obligations or any provision of any applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit payment by any Borrowing Subsidiary of the Guaranteed Obligations in the manner agreed upon between such Borrowing Subsidiary and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. SECTION 4.04. CONTINUING GUARANTY. The Lenders may make or continue Loans to and issue Letters of Credit for the account of any of the Borrowing Subsidiaries from time to time without notice to or authorization from Whirlpool regardless of the financial or other condition of any Borrowing Subsidiary at the time any Loan is made or continued or any Letter of Credit is issued, and no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose or discuss with Whirlpool its assessment of the financial condition of any of the Borrowing Subsidiaries. This guaranty shall continue in effect, notwithstanding any extensions, modifications, renewals or indulgences with respect to, or substitution for, the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been paid in full and all of the Commitments shall have expired or been terminated. 53
SECTION 4.05. DELAY OF SUBROGATION. Until the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full, Whirlpool shall not exercise any right of subrogation with respect to payments made by Whirlpool pursuant to this guaranty. SECTION 4.06. ACCELERATION. Whirlpool agrees that, as between Whirlpool on the one hand, and the Lenders, the Fronting Agent and the Administrative Agent, on the other hand, the obligations of any Borrowing Subsidiary guaranteed under this Article 4 may be declared to be forthwith due and payable, or may be deemed automatically to have been accelerated, as provided in Section 9.01 for purposes of this Article 4, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition (whether in a bankruptcy proceeding affecting such Borrowing Subsidiary or otherwise) preventing such declaration as against such Borrowing Subsidiary and that, in the event of such declaration or automatic acceleration, such obligations (whether or not due and payable by such Borrowing Subsidiary) shall forthwith become due and payable by Whirlpool for purposes of this Article 4. SECTION 4.07. REINSTATEMENT. The obligations of Whirlpool under this Article 4 shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and Whirlpool agrees that it will indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent and each Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent or such Lender in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law. ARTICLE 5 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT SECTION 5.01. EFFECTIVENESS.

To ensure the legality, validity, enforceability or admissibility in evidence of each such Loan Document in such jurisdiction, it is not necessary that any such Loan Document or any other document be filed or recorded with any court or other authority of such jurisdiction or that any stamp or similar tax be paid on or in respect of any such Loan Documents. SECTION 6.16 SOLVENCY.

In computing the amount of contingent liabilities at any time, it is intended that such liabilities will be computed at the amount which, in light of all the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability. SECTION 6.17 TAX SHELTER REGULATIONS. The Borrowers do not intend to treat the Advances as being a "reportable transaction" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4). In the event any Borrower determines to take any action inconsistent with such intention, it will promptly notify the Administrative Agent thereof. If any Borrower so notifies the Administrative Agent, such Borrower acknowledges that one or more of the Lenders may treat its Advances as part of a transaction that is subject to Treasury Regulation Section 301.6112-1, and such Lender or Lenders, as applicable, will maintain the lists and other records required by such Treasury Regulation. 61

(b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Credit Agreement, after acceleration of the Obligations, all amounts collected or received by the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent or any Lender on account of amounts outstanding under any of the Loan Documents shall be paid over or delivered as follows: FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) of the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent or any of the Lenders in connection with enforcing the rights of the Lenders under the Loan Documents; SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent the Issuing Lender or any Lender; THIRD, to the payment of all accrued interest payable to the Lenders hereunder; FOURTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the Advances and to the payment or cash collateralization of the outstanding LOC Obligations, pro rata, as set forth below; FIFTH, to all other obligations which shall have become due and payable under the Credit Documents and not repaid pursuant to clauses "FIRST" through "FOURTH" above; and SIXTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus. In carrying out the foregoing, (a) amounts received shall be applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next succeeding category; (b) each of the Lenders shall receive an amount equal to its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the then outstanding Advances and LOC Obligations held by such Lender bears to the aggregate then outstanding Advances and LOC Obligations) of amounts available to be applied pursuant to clauses "FIRST", "THIRD," "FOURTH" and "FIFTH" above; and (c) to the extent that any amounts available for distribution pursuant to clause "FOURTH" above are attributable to the issued but undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit, such amounts shall be held by the Administrative Agent in a cash collateral account and applied (x) first, to reimburse the Issuing Lender from time to time for any drawings under such Letters of Credit and (y) then, following the expiration of all Letters of Credit, to all other obligations of the types described in clauses "FOURTH" and "FIFTH" above in the manner provided in this Section 9.01. 74

If, for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment against any Borrower in any court or in any jurisdiction, it becomes necessary to convert into or from any currency other than the Obligation Currency (such other currency being hereinafter referred to as the "Judgment Currency") an amount due in the Obligation Currency, the conversion shall be made at the Dollar Amount, determined as of the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which the judgment is given (such Business Day being hereinafter referred to as the "Judgment Currency Conversion Date"). (ii) If there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing between the Judgment Currency Conversion Date and the date of actual payment of the amount due, such amount payable by the applicable Borrower shall be reduced or increased, as applicable, such that the amount paid in the Judgment Currency, when converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment, will produce the amount of the Obligation Currency which could have been purchased with the amount of Judgment Currency stipulated in the judgment or judicial award at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Judgment Currency Conversion Date. Each Borrower agrees to pay any additional amounts payable by it under this subsection (ii) as a separate obligation notwithstanding any such judgment or judicial award. SECTION 9.03. AMENDMENTS. Subject to the provisions of this Article 9, the Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with the consent in writing of the Required Lenders) and the Borrowers may enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or the Borrowers hereunder or waiving any Default hereunder; provided, however, that no such supplemental agreement shall without the consent of each Lender directly or indirectly affected thereby: (i) Extend the maturity of any Loan or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of any interest thereon or extend the time of payment of any reimbursement obligation under a Letter of Credit; (ii) Reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of any fees due hereunder or amounts due under Section 3.01, 3.02, 3.03 or 3.05; 75

The Administrative Agent may waive payment of the fee required under Section 13.03(b) without obtaining the consent of any of the Lenders. SECTION 9.04. PRESERVATION OF RIGHTS. No delay or omission of the Lenders, the Fronting Agent or the Administrative Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and the making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of a Default or the inability of any Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Loan or Letter of Credit shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable, pursuant to Section 9.03, and then only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies contained in the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be available to the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent and the Lenders until the Obligations have been paid in full. 76

The expenses of arbitration shall be paid by such Foreign Borrower. 79

Each of the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent may execute any of its duties as Administrative Agent or as the Fronting Agent, as applicable, hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the Lenders, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to the agency hereby created and its duties hereunder and under any other Loan Document. SECTION 11.07. RELIANCE ON DOCUMENTS; COUNSEL. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any Note, LOC Document, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, statement, paper or document reasonably and in good faith believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and, in respect to legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, which counsel may be employees of the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent. 83
SECTION 11.08. REIMBURSEMENT AND INDEMNIFICATION. The Lenders agree to reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent ratably in proportion to their respective Commitments for (i) any amounts not reimbursed by the Borrowers for which the Administrative Agent (acting as such) or the Fronting Agent (acting as such) is entitled to reimbursement by the Borrowers under the Loan Documents, (ii) for any other expenses not reimbursed by the Borrowers incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents, and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever and not reimbursed by the Borrowers which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (acting as such) or the Fronting Agent (acting as such) in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby, or the enforcement of any of the terms thereof or of any such other documents, provided that no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable. SECTION 11.09. RIGHTS AS A LENDER. With respect to its respective Commitment, Loans made by it, and any Notes issued to it, the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent, the Syndication Agent and each Documentation Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan Document as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent, the Syndication Agent or a Documentation Agent, as the case may be, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent, the Syndication Agent and each Documentation Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender. The Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent, the Syndication Agent, each Documentation Agent and each Lender may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in addition to those contemplated by this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, with any Borrower or any Subsidiary of a Borrower. SECTION 11.10. LENDER CREDIT DECISION. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent, the Syndication Agent, any Documentation Agent or any other Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by Whirlpool and the other Borrowers and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent, the Syndication Agent, any Documentation Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 84
SECTION 11.11. SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT/FRONTING AGENT. Each of the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrowers, such resignation to be effective upon the appointment of a successor Administrative Agent or Fronting Agent, as applicable. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint (with, so long as no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the consent of Whirlpool, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), on behalf of the Borrowers and the Lenders, a successor Administrative Agent or Fronting Agent, as applicable. If no successor Administrative Agent or Fronting Agent, as applicable, shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty days after the resigning Administrative Agent's or Fronting Agent's, as applicable, giving notice of its resignation, then such resignation shall nevertheless become effective and thereafter the Lenders shall perform all duties of the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor in accordance with the terms above. No successor Administrative Agent or Fronting Agent shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until such successor has accepted the appointment. Any successor Administrative Agent shall be a commercial bank having capital and retained earnings of at least $100,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent or as Fronting Agent, as applicable, hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent or Fronting Agent, as applicable, such successor shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning Administrative Agent or resigning Fronting Agent, as applicable. Upon the effectiveness of the resignation of an Administrative Agent or a Fronting Agent, the resigning Person shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the resignation of any Administrative Agent or Fronting Agent, the provisions of this Article 11 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent or Fronting Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. ARTICLE 12 SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS SECTION 12.01. SETOFF. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of the Lenders under applicable law, if any Borrower becomes insolvent, however evidenced, or any Default (or Unmatured Default pursuant to Section 8.02, 8.05 or 8.06) occurs, any and all deposits (including all account balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or available) and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender to or for the credit or account of any Borrower may be offset and applied toward the payment of the Obligations owing to such Lender, whether or not the Obligations, or any part thereof, shall then be due, matured or unmatured, contingent or non-contingent. 85
SECTION 12.02. RATABLE PAYMENTS. If, after the occurrence of a Default, any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise, has payment made to it upon its share of any Advance (other than a Competitive Bid Advance) or LOC Obligations (other than payments received pursuant to Article 3) in a greater proportion than that received by any other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a portion of the Loans comprising such Advance held by the other Lenders or to purchase a Participation Interest in such LOC Obligations so that after such purchase each Lender will hold its ratable proportion of Loans comprising such Advance or Participation Interests in such LOC Obligations. The Lenders further agree among themselves that if payment to a Lender obtained by such Lender through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim or other event as aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Lender which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by payment in cash or a repurchase of a participation theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit (together with its share of any accrued interest payable with respect thereto) to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored. The Borrowers agree that any Lender so purchasing such a participation may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan, LOC Obligation or other obligation in the amount of such participation. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Credit Agreement, if any Lender or the Administrative Agent shall fail to remit to the Administrative Agent or any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender or the Administrative Agent to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender pursuant to this Credit Agreement on the date when such amount is due, such payments shall be made together with interest thereon if paid within two Business Days of the date when such amount is due at a per annum rate equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate and thereafter at a per annum rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender. If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section 12.02 applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders under this Section 12.02 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim. ARTICLE 13 BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; PARTICIPATIONS; ASSIGNMENTS SECTION 13.01. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The terms and provisions of the Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrowers, the Lenders, the Issuing Lender, the Fronting Agent and the Administrative Agent and their respective successors and assigns, except that (i) no Borrower shall have the right to assign its rights or obligations under the Loan Documents, and (ii) any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance with Section 13.03. Notwithstanding clause (ii) of this Section, any Lender may at any time, without the consent of any Borrower, the Syndication Agent, the Documentation Agents, the Fronting Agent or the 86
Administrative Agent, assign all or any portion of its rights under this Credit Agreement and its Notes, if any, to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided, however, that no such assignment shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder. The Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent may treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until such payee complies with Section 13.03 in the case of an assignment thereof or, in the case of any other transfer, a written notice of the transfer is filed with the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent. Any assignee or transferee of a Lender's rights or obligations hereunder agrees by acceptance thereof to be bound by all the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents. Any request, authority or consent of any Person, who at the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the holder of any Note, shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of such Note or of any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor. SECTION 13.02. PARTICIPATIONS. (a) Permitted Participations; Effect. Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants") participating interests in all or a portion of its rights, obligations or rights and obligations under the Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, all amounts payable by the Borrowers under this Credit Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participating interests, and the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents. (b) Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the sole right to approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Loan or Commitment in which such Participant has an interest which forgives principal, interest or fees or reduces the interest rate or fees payable with respect to any such Loan, Letter of Credit or Commitment, postpones any date fixed for any regularly-scheduled payment of principal of, or interest or fees on, any such Loan, Letter of Credit or Commitment, releases any guarantor of any such Loan or releases any substantial portion of collateral, if any, securing any such Loan. (c) Benefit of Setoff. The Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section 12.01 in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents, provided that each Lender shall retain the right of setoff provided in Section 12.01 with respect to the amount of participating interests sold to each Participant. The Lenders agree to share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the right of setoff provided in Section 12.01, agrees to share with each Lender, any amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance with Section 12.02 as if each Participant were a Lender. 87
SECTION 13.03. ASSIGNMENTS. (a) Permitted Assignments. Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time assign to one or more banks or other entities ("Purchasers") any part of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents; provided that, no assignment may be made without the prior written consent of Whirlpool and the Administrative Agent in their sole discretion, unless (i) such Lender retains at all times a Commitment which, is not less than $15,000,000 (unless such Lender is assigning all of its Commitment), (ii) each such assignment to any Purchaser of any portion of such Lender's Commitment shall be in an amount which is not less than $15,000,000 (or, if less, the remaining amount of its Commitment) and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (iii) such Lender has provided Whirlpool with three Business Days prior notice of such assignment, including such information regarding the Purchaser as Whirlpool may reasonably request, and Whirlpool has confirmed, on behalf of the Dutch Borrowers, that the Purchaser has the status of a Professional Market Party. For purposes of clause (iii) above, if Whirlpool does not raise any objection within the three Business Day period, it shall be deemed to have confirmed that the Purchaser is a Professional Market Party. Each such assignment shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit "F" hereto or in such other form as may be agreed to by the parties thereto. The consent of Whirlpool and the Administrative Agent shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an affiliate thereof, and the consent of each Issuing Lender shall be required prior to any assignment becoming effective; provided, however, that if a Default has occurred and is continuing, the consent of Whirlpool shall not be required. No consents required by this Section 13.03(a) shall be unreasonably withheld. (b) Effect; Effective Date. Upon (i) delivery to the Administrative Agent of a notice of assignment substantially in the form attached as Annex "I" to Exhibit "F" hereto (a "Notice of Assignment"), together with any consent required by Section 13.03(a), (ii) payment of a $3,500 processing fee to the Administrative Agent for processing such assignment and (iii) recordation of such assignment in the Register as required by Section 13.03(c), such assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified in such Notice of Assignment. The Notice of Assignment shall contain a representation by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the consideration used to make the purchase of the Commitment, Loans and Participation Interests under the applicable assignment agreement are "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and that the rights and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will not be "plan assets" under ERISA. On and after the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this Credit Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by the Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party hereto, and no further consent or action by the Borrowers, the Lenders or the Administrative Agent shall be required to release the transferor Lender with respect to the percentage of the Aggregate Commitment, Loans and Participation Interests assigned to such Purchaser. 88
(c) Register. The Borrowers hereby designate the Administrative Agent to serve as the Borrowers' agent, solely for the purpose of this paragraph, to maintain a register (the "Register") on which the Administrative Agent will record each Lender's Commitment, the Loans made by each Lender, and each repayment in respect of the principal amount of the Loans of each Lender and annexed to which the Administrative Agent shall retain a copy of Notice of Assignment delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 13.03(b). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person in whose name a Loan is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice or any provisions herein to the contrary. A Lender's Commitment and the Loans made pursuant thereto may be assigned or otherwise transferred in whole or in part only by registration of such assignment or transfer in the Register. Any assignment or transfer of a Lender's Commitment or the Loans made pursuant thereto shall be registered in the Register only upon delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Notice of Assignment duly executed by the assignor thereof. No assignment or transfer of a Lender's Commitment or the Loans made pursuant thereto shall be effective unless such assignment or transfer shall have been recorded in the Register by the Administrative Agent as provided in this Section. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. SECTION 13.04. DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION. Each Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender's possession concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries. SECTION 13.05. TAX TREATMENT. If any interest in any Loan Document is transferred to any Transferee, the transferor Lender shall cause such Transferee, as a condition to such transfer, to comply with the provisions of Section 2.08(l). SECTION 13.06. SPC'S. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an "SPC") the option to fund all or any part of any Advance that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to fund pursuant to this Credit Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Advance, (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to fund all or any part of such Advance, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to fund such Advance pursuant to the terms hereof, (iii) no SPC shall have any voting rights pursuant to Section 9.03 (all such voting rights shall be retained by the Granting Lenders), (iv) with respect to notices, payments and other matters hereunder, the Credit Parties, the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent and the Lenders shall not be obligated to deal with an SPC, but may limit their communications and other dealings relevant to such SPC to the applicable Granting Lender and (v) the Granting Lender has provided Whirlpool with three 89
Business Days prior notice of such assignment, including such information regarding the SPC as Whirlpool may reasonably request, and Whirlpool has confirmed, on behalf of the Dutch Borrowers, that the SPC has the status of a Professional Market Party. For purposes of clause (v) above, if Whirlpool does not raise any objection within the three Business Day period, it shall be deemed to have confirmed that the SPC is a Professional Market Party. The funding of an Advance by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent that, and as if, such Advance were funded by such Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or payment under this Credit Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable for so long as, and to the extent, the Granting Lender provides such indemnity or makes such payment. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreements shall survive termination of this Credit Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Credit Agreement, any SPC may disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its funding of Advances to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancements to such SPC. This Section may not be amended without the prior written consent of each Granting Lender, all or any part of whose Advance is being funded by an SPC at the time of such amendment. SECTION 13.07 REPRESENTATION OF THE LENDERS. Each Lender represents and warrants to each of the Dutch Borrowers that such Lender is a Professional Market Party. ARTICLE 14 NOTICES SECTION 14.01. GIVING NOTICE. (a) Except as otherwise permitted by Section 2.07(g) or as provided in subsection (b) below, all notices and other communications provided to any party hereto under this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be in writing or by telecopy (and promptly confirmed) and addressed or delivered to such party at its address set forth on Schedule V hereto or at such other address as may be designated by such party in a notice to the other parties. Any notice, if mailed and properly addressed with postage prepaid, or sent overnight delivery via a reputable carrier, shall be deemed given when received; any notice, if transmitted by telecopy, shall be deemed given when transmitted. (b) So long as Citibank or any of its Affiliates is the Administrative Agent, materials required to be delivered pursuant to Section 7.01(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent in an electronic or other acceptable medium in a format acceptable to the 90
Administrative Agent and the Lenders by e-mail at oploanswebadmin@citigroup.com or if by another medium to the address of the Administrative Agent. In the event such materials are transmitted to such e-mail address such transmission shall satisfy the Borrowers' obligation to deliver such materials. The Borrowers agree that the Administrative Agent may make such materials, as well as any other written information, documents, instruments and other material relating to the Borrowers, any of their Subsidiaries or any other materials or matters relating to this Credit Agreement, the Notes or any of the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the "Communications") available to the Lenders by posting such notices on Intralinks or a substantially similar electronic system (the "Platform"). The Borrowers acknowledge that (i) the distribution of material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure and that there are confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution, (ii) the Platform is provided "as is" and "as available" and (iii) neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Affiliates warrants the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of the Communications or the Platform and each expressly disclaims liability for errors or omissions in the Communications or the Platform. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including, without limitation, any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made by the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in connection with the Platform. (c) Each Lender agrees that notice to it (as provided in the next sentence) (a "Notice") specifying that any Communications have been posted to the Platform shall constitute effective delivery of such information, documents or other materials to such Lender for purposes of this Credit Agreement; provided that if requested by any Lender the Administrative Agent shall deliver a copy of the Communications to such Lender by email or telecopier. Each Lender agrees (i) to notify the Administrative Agent in writing of such Lender's e-mail address to which a Notice may be sent by electronic transmission (including by electronic communication) on or before the date such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter to ensure that the Administrative Agent has on record an effective e-mail address for such Lender) and (ii) that any Notice may be sent to such e-mail address. SECTION 14.02. CHANGE OF ADDRESS. Subject to Section 10.10(b), each Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent and each Lender may change the address for service of notice upon it by a notice in writing to the other parties hereto. ARTICLE 15 COUNTERPARTS This Credit Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one agreement, and any of the parties hereto may execute this Credit Agreement by signing any such counterpart. This Credit Agreement shall be effective when it has been executed by the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent and the Lenders and the Administrative Agent has either received such executed counterparts or has been notified, by telecopy, that such party has executed its counterparts. Delivery of an executed counterpart by facsimile shall be effective as an original executed counterpart and shall be deemed a representation that an original executed counterpart will be delivered. 91
ARTICLE 16 PATRIOT ACT NOTICE Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "Act"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each borrower, guarantor or grantor (the "Loan Parties"), which information includes the name and address of each Loan Party and other information that will allow such Lender to identify such Loan Party in accordance with the Act. 92
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders have caused this Credit Agreement to be duly executed by their duly authorized officers, all as of the day and year first above written.

(i) Each Competitive Bid Quote shall in any case specify: (A) the proposed Borrowing Date, which shall be the same as that set forth in the applicable Invitation for Competitive Bid Quotes; (B) the principal amount of the Competitive Bid Loan for which each such offer is being made, (1) which principal amount may be greater than, less than or equal to the Commitment of the quoting Lender, but in no case greater than the unutilized Aggregate Commitment, (2) which principal amount must be at least $5,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000, and (3) which principal amount may not exceed the principal amount of Competitive Bid Loans for which offers were requested; (C) in the case of a Eurocurrency Auction, the Competitive Bid Margin offered for each such Competitive Bid Loan; (D) in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, the Absolute Rate offered for each such Competitive Bid Loan; (E) the applicable Interest Period; and (F) the identity of the quoting Lender. 24
(ii) The Administrative Agent shall reject any Competitive Bid Quote that: (A) is not substantially in the form of Exhibit "D" hereto or does not specify all of the information required by Section 2.04(d)(i); (B) contains qualifying, conditional or similar language, other than any such language contained in Exhibit "D" hereto; (C) proposes terms other than or in addition to those set forth in the applicable Invitation for Competitive Bid Quotes; or (D) arrives after the time set forth in Section 2.04(d)(i). (iii) If any Competitive Bid Quote shall be rejected pursuant to Section 2.04(d)(ii), then the Administrative Agent shall notify the relevant Lender of such rejection as soon as practicable. (e) Notice to Borrower. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the applicable Borrower of the terms (i) of any Competitive Bid Quote submitted by a Lender that is in accordance with Section 2.04 and (ii) of any Competitive Bid Quote that is in accordance with Section 2.04 and amends, modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a previous Competitive Bid Quote submitted by such Lender with respect to the same Competitive Bid Quote Request. Any such subsequent Competitive Bid Quote shall be disregarded by the Administrative Agent unless such subsequent Competitive Bid Quote specifically states that it is submitted solely to correct a manifest error in such former Competitive Bid Quote. The Administrative Agent's notice to the applicable Borrower shall specify the aggregate principal amount of Competitive Bid Loans for which offers have been received for each Interest Period specified in the related Competitive Bid Quote Request and the respective principal amounts and Competitive Bid Margins or Absolute Rates, as the case may be, so offered. (f) Acceptance and Notice by Borrower. Subject to the receipt of the notice from the Administrative Agent referred to in Section 2.04(e), not later than 11:30 A.M. (New York City time) (i) at least three Business Days prior to the proposed Borrowing Date, in the case of a Eurocurrency Auction or (ii) on the proposed Borrowing Date, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, the applicable Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such Borrower's acceptance or rejection of the offers so notified to it pursuant to Section 2.04(e); provided, however, that the failure by such Borrower to give such notice to the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be a rejection by such Borrower of all such offers. In the case of acceptance, such notice substantially in the form or Exhibit "L" hereto (a "Competitive Bid Borrowing Notice") shall specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for each Interest Period that are accepted. The applicable Borrower may accept or reject any Competitive Bid Quote in whole or in part; provided that: 25
(i) the aggregate principal amount of each Competitive Bid Advance may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related Competitive Bid Quote Request; (ii) acceptance of offers may only be made on the basis of ascending Competitive Bid Margins or Absolute Rates, as the case may be; and (iii) the applicable Borrower may not accept any offer of the type described in Section 2.04(d)(ii) or that otherwise fails to comply with the requirements of this Credit Agreement for the purpose of obtaining a Competitive Bid Loan under this Credit Agreement. (g) Allocation by the Administrative Agent. If offers are made by two or more Lenders with the same Competitive Bid Margins or Absolute Rates, as the case may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which offers are permitted to be accepted for the related Interest Period, the principal amount of Competitive Bid Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall be allocated by the Administrative Agent among such Lenders as nearly as possible (in such multiples of $1,000,000 as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of such offers. Allocations by the Administrative Agent of the amounts of Competitive Bid Loans shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall promptly, but in any event on the same Business Day in the case of Eurocurrency Bid Rate Advances, and by 12:30 P.M. (New York City time) on the same Business Day in the case of Absolute Rate Advances, notify each Lender of its receipt of a Competitive Bid Borrowing Notice and the aggregate principal amount of each Competitive Bid Advance allocated to each participating Lender. SECTION 2.05. FRONTED ADVANCE SUBFACILITY. (a) Fronted Advances. From and including the Effective Date and prior to the Termination Date, each Fronting Lender severally agrees, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Credit Agreement and notwithstanding the amount of Competitive Bid Loans made by such Fronting Lender, to make Fronted Loans to Whirlpool and Whirlpool Finance from time to time in amounts the Dollar Amount of which shall not exceed, in the aggregate at any one time outstanding, the amount of its Fronting Commitment. Each Fronted Advance hereunder shall consist of borrowings made from the several Fronting Lenders ratably in proportion to the ratio that their respective Fronting Commitments bear to the Aggregate Fronting Sublimit. The Fronted Advances shall be repaid as provided by the terms of Sections 2.02 and 2.05(f). (b) Types of Fronted Advances. The Fronted Advances shall be Fixed Rate Advances. (c) Reductions in Aggregate Fronting Sublimit. Whirlpool may permanently reduce the Aggregate Fronting Sublimit in whole, or in part ratably among the Fronting Lenders in integral multiples of $25,000,000, upon at least three Business Days' written notice to the Administrative Agent, which notice shall specify the amount of any such reduction; provided, however, that the amount of the Aggregate Fronting Sublimit may not be reduced below the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Fronted Advances. 26
(d) Minimum Amount of Each Fronted Advance. Each Fronted Advance made or continued hereunder shall be in the minimum Dollar Amount of $25,000,000. (e) Method of Requesting New Fronted Advances. Whirlpool or Whirlpool Finance, as applicable, shall give the Fronting Agent, with a copy to the Administrative Agent, an irrevocable notice substantially in the form of Exhibit "K" hereto (a "Fronted Borrowing Notice") not later than 9:30 a.m. (London, England time) on the Borrowing Date of each Fronted Advance. A Fronted Borrowing Notice shall in accordance with all the terms and conditions of this Credit Agreement specify: (i) the Borrower to which such Fronted Advance is to be made; (ii) the Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day, of such Fronted Advance; (iii) the Agreed Currency of such Fronted Advance; (iv) the aggregate amount of such Fronted Advance; and (v) the Interest Period of such Fronted Advance, which shall be for a period of one to seven days. (f) Payment and Participations of Fronted Advances. At the time that a Fronting Lender makes a Fronted Loan, each Lender (a "Purchasing Lender") shall be deemed, without any further action by any Person, to have purchased from such Fronting Lender an unfunded participation (ratably in proportion to the ratio that such Purchasing Lender's Commitment bears to the Aggregate Commitment), without recourse or warranty of such Fronting Lender, in such Fronted Loan. Whirlpool and Whirlpool Finance each agree to repay all Fronted Advances obtained by such Borrower on the earlier of (i) the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance or (ii) the Termination Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither Whirlpool nor Whirlpool Finance shall be permitted to request a new Fronted Advance to repay an outstanding Fronted Advance if the period from the date of the first outstanding Fronted Advance to the date of the repayment of the new Fronted Advance would exceed seven days. Each repayment of a Fronted Advance may be accomplished by requesting a Committed Advance, which request is not subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.04. In the event that Whirlpool or Whirlpool Finance, as applicable, shall fail to timely repay any Fronted Advance, and in any event upon (A) a request by the Fronting Agent, (B) the occurrence of a Default described in Section 8.05 or 8.06 or (C) the acceleration of any Obligations or termination of any 27
Commitment pursuant to Section 9.01, each Purchasing Lender shall fund its participation in accordance with the preceding paragraph in such Fronted Advance (regardless of (1) whether the conditions precedent thereto set forth in Section 5.04 hereof are then satisfied, (2) whether or not Whirlpool or Whirlpool Finance, as applicable, has submitted a Committed Borrowing Notice and whether or not the Commitments are then in effect, (3) whether an Unmatured Default or a Default exists or (4) whether all the Obligations have been accelerated) and pay the proceeds thereof to the Fronting Agent, for the account of the Fronting Lenders, at the Fronting Agent's Eurocurrency Payment Office, or at such other Lending Installation of the Fronting Agent as may be specified in writing by the Fronting Agent, in the applicable Agreed Currency and in immediately available funds. If such amount is not in fact made available to the Fronting Agent, for the account of the Fronting Lenders, by any Purchasing Lender, the Fronting Lenders shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Purchasing Lender, together with accrued interest thereon for each day from the date of demand thereof, if paid within two Business Days after demand at the Federal Funds Effective Rate and thereafter at the Alternate Base Rate. If a Purchasing Lender does not pay such amount forthwith as required by this Section 2.05(f), and until such time as such Purchasing Lender makes the required payment, the Fronting Lenders shall be deemed to continue to have outstanding Fronted Advances in the amount of such unpaid participation obligation for all purposes of the Loan Documents other than those provisions requiring the other Purchasing Lenders to purchase a participation therein. Further, such Purchasing Lender shall be deemed to have assigned any and all payments made of principal and interest on its Loans, and any other amounts due to it hereunder to the Fronting Lenders to fund Fronted Advances in the amount of the participation in Fronted Advances that such Purchasing Lender failed to purchase pursuant to this Section 2.05(f) until such amount has been purchased (as a result of such assignment or otherwise). SECTION 2.06. FEES. (a) Facility Fee. Whirlpool hereby agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, ratably in proportion to their Commitments, a facility fee at the Facility Fee Rate on the daily actual amount of the Aggregate Commitment (in each case, without regard to the outstanding principal amount of the Loans) for the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the Termination Date, which fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each Payment Date, commencing December 31, 2005, and on the Termination Date. (b) Utilization Fee. With respect to each day prior to the Term Loan Conversion Date that the Dollar Amount of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Loans exceeds the product of (i) one-half (1/2) times (ii) Aggregate Commitment, Whirlpool hereby agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, ratably in proportion to their Commitments, a utilization fee at a per annum rate equal to the Utilization Fee Rate on the Dollar Amount of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans on each such day, which fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each Payment Date, commencing December 31, 2005, and on the Termination Date. 28
(c) Administration Fees. Whirlpool hereby agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent for their respective accounts such arrangement and administration fees as are heretofore and hereafter agreed upon in writing by Whirlpool and the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable. (d) Competitive Bid Fees. Upon submission of a Competitive Bid Quote Request to the Administrative Agent, the applicable Borrower hereby agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for its sole account an auction fee of $1,000. (e) Fronting Fees. Whirlpool hereby agrees to pay to the Fronting Agent, for the account of the Fronting Lenders, ratably in proportion to their Fronting Commitments, a fronting fee at a per annum rate equal to 0.125% on the Dollar Amount of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Fronted Loans on each such day, which fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each Payment Date, commencing December 31, 2005, and on the Termination Date. SECTION 2.07. GENERAL FACILITY TERMS. (a) Method of Borrowing. On each Borrowing Date, each applicable Lender shall make available its Loan or Loans, if any, in the requested Agreed Currency, (i) if such Loan is denominated in Dollars, not later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent, at its address specified in or pursuant to Article 14, (ii) if such Loan (other than a Fronted Loan) is denominated in another currency, not later than 12:00 noon, local time in the city of the Administrative Agent's Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency, in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent, at the Administrative Agent's Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency and (iii) if such Loan is a Fronted Loan, not later than 12:00 noon (London, England time), in funds immediately available to the Fronting Agent, at the Fronting Agent's Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency. The Administrative Agent or Fronting Agent, as applicable, will make the funds so received from the applicable Lenders available to the applicable Borrower at the Administrative Agent's or Fronting Agent's aforesaid address, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.07(a), to the extent that a Loan made by a Lender matures on the Borrowing Date of a requested Loan denominated in the same Agreed Currency as that of the maturing Loan, such Lender shall apply the proceeds of the Loan it is then making to the repayment of principal of the maturing Loan. (b) Prepayments. (i) Optional Prepayments. Each Borrower may from time to time prepay all of its outstanding Floating Rate Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of $5,000,000 (and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 if in excess thereof), any portion of the outstanding Floating Rate Advances upon one Business Day's prior notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Borrower may from time to time prepay all of its outstanding Eurocurrency Committed Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate Dollar Amount of $5,000,000 29
and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 if in excess thereof, any portion of the outstanding Eurocurrency Committed Advances upon three Business Days' prior notice to the Administrative Agent. Whirlpool or Whirlpool Finance, as applicable, may from time to time prepay all of its outstanding Fronted Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate Dollar Amount of $5,000,000, any portion of the outstanding Fronted Advances upon three Business Days' prior notice to the Fronting Agent (with a copy to the Administrative Agent). No Competitive Bid Loan may be prepaid prior to the last day of its applicable Interest Period without the prior consent of the Lender holding such Competitive Bid Loan, which consent may be given or withheld at such Lender's sole and absolute discretion. Any such prepayment pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.07 of a Eurocurrency Committed Advance, a Fronted Advance or a Competitive Bid Loan prior to the end of its applicable Interest Period shall be subject to the provisions of Section 3.05. (ii) Mandatory Prepayments. (A) Aggregate Commitment. If at any time, the sum of the Dollar Amount of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Advances shall exceed the Aggregate Commitment, the Borrowers immediately shall prepay outstanding Advances in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess. (B) Aggregate Fronting Sublimit. If at any time, the Dollar Amount of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Fronted Advances shall exceed the Aggregate Fronting Sublimit, the Borrowers immediately shall prepay outstanding Fronted Advances in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess. (c) Interest Rates; Interest Periods. Subject to Section 2.07(d), (i) each Floating Rate Advance (and each Floating Rate Loan making up such Floating Rate Advance) shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and including the date such Advance is made or is converted from a Eurocurrency Committed Advance pursuant to Section 2.03(f) to but excluding the date it is paid or is converted into a Eurocurrency Committed Advance pursuant to Section 2.03(f), at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate for such day, (ii) each Eurocurrency Committed Advance (and each Eurocurrency Loan making up such Eurocurrency Committed Advance) shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day of each Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate determined pursuant hereto as applicable to such Eurocurrency Committed Advance for each day during such Interest Period, (iii) each Fronted Advance (and each Fronted Loan making up such Fronted Advance) shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day 30
of each Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate determined pursuant hereto as applicable to such Fronted Advance for each day during such Interest Period, (iv) each Absolute Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Absolute Rate determined pursuant hereto as applicable to such Absolute Rate Loan, and (v) each Eurocurrency Bid Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Bid Rate determined pursuant hereto as applicable to such Eurocurrency Bid Rate Loan. Changes in the rate of interest on each Floating Rate Advance will take effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate. No Interest Period shall end after the Termination Date. (d) Rate after Certain Defaults. (i) During the existence of any Default (other than pursuant to Section 8.02(i)), the Required Lenders may, at their option by notice to the Borrowers, declare that each Advance shall bear interest or accrue an issuance fee, respectively, at a rate per annum equal to the rate otherwise applicable to such Advance or such fee plus 1% per annum. (ii) During the existence of any Default under Section 8.02(i), each Advance (and each Loan making up such Advance) not paid when due, whether by acceleration or otherwise, shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and including the date such Advance matures (or the date such reimbursement obligation arises), whether by acceleration or otherwise, to but excluding the date it is paid, at the rate otherwise applicable to such Advance plus 2% per annum or, if no rate is applicable, the Alternate Base Rate plus 2% per annum, payable on demand. (iii) During the existence of any Default, the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the Borrowers, declare that no Advance may be converted into or continued as a Dollar-denominated Eurocurrency Committed Advance. (e) Interest Payment Dates; Interest Basis. Interest accrued on each Floating Rate Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof, on any date on which such Floating Rate Advance is prepaid or converted, whether due to acceleration or otherwise, at maturity and thereafter on demand. Subject to the next sentence, interest accrued on each Fixed Rate Advance shall be payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which such Fixed Rate Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or otherwise, at maturity and thereafter on demand. Interest accrued on each Fixed Rate Advance having an Interest Period longer than three months shall also be payable on the last day of each 90 day interval (in the case of Absolute Rate Advances) or three-month interval (in the case of 31
Eurocurrency Committed Advances or Eurocurrency Bid Rate Advances) during such Interest Period. Interest on all Fixed Rate Advances (other than Fixed Rate Advances denominated in Sterling), all Floating Rate Advances which bear interest based on the Federal Funds Effective Rate and all fees due hereunder shall be calculated for the actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year. Interest on all Fixed Rate Advances denominated in Sterling shall be calculated for the actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a 365/366 day year. Interest on all Floating Rate Advances which bear interest based on the Prime Rate shall be calculated for the actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a 365, or when appropriate 366, day year. Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior to noon (local time) at the place of payment. If any payment of principal of, or interest on, an Advance or of fees due hereunder shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in connection with such payment. Each Borrower promises to pay interest on its respective Advances as provided in this Section 2.07(e). (f) Method of Payment. (i) General. Each Advance shall be paid, repaid or prepaid in the currency in which such Advance was made in the amount borrowed or paid and interest payable thereon shall be paid in such currency. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.07(a), (A) all amounts of principal, interest, fees and other Obligations payable by the Borrowers in Dollars under the Loan Documents (other than in respect of Fronted Advances) shall be made in Dollars by 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date when due in funds immediately available, without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff, to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's address specified pursuant to Article 14, or at such other Lending Installation of the Administrative Agent as may be specified in writing by the Administrative Agent to the Borrowers, (B) all amounts of principal and interest payable by Whirlpool or Whirlpool Finance, as applicable, with respect to Fronted Advances shall be made in the applicable currency by 12:00 noon (London, England time or, in the case of amounts payable in Dollars, New York time) on the date when due, in funds immediately available, without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff, for the account of the Fronting Agent, at the Fronting Agent's Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency and (C) all other amounts of principal, interest and other Obligations payable by the Borrowers in any currency other than Dollars under the Loan Documents shall be made in such currency by 12:00 noon (local time) on the date when due, in funds immediately available, without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff, for the account of the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, at its Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency. Prior to the existence of a Default, all amounts due 32
hereunder shall be made ratably among the applicable Lenders in the case of payments of principal or interest in respect of Competitive Bid Advances and ratably among all of the Lenders in the case of all other payments (other than payments of principal and interest in respect of Fronted Advances (which are subject to Section 2.07(f)(ii) below) and fronting fees retained by the Fronting Lenders for their own accounts, the administrative and auction fees retained by the Administrative Agent for its own account and the administrative fee retained by the Fronting Agent for its own account). Except as provided in Section 9.01(b), during the existence of any Default, all payments of principal due hereunder shall be applied ratably among all outstanding Advances and Participation Interests. Each payment delivered to the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, for the account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly, but in any event not later than the close of business on the date received by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, if received by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, by 12:00 noon (local time), by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, to such Lender in the same type and currency of funds which the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, received at such Lender's address specified pursuant to Article 14 or at any Lending Installation specified by such Lender in a written notice received by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable. If the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, shall fail to pay any Lender the amount due such Lender pursuant to this Section when due, the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, shall be obligated to pay to such Lender interest on the amount that should have been paid hereunder for each day from the date such amount shall have become due until the date such amount is paid at the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.07(f), if, after the making of any Advance in any currency other than Dollars, currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency with the result that different types of such currency (the "New Currency") are introduced and the type of currency in which the Advance was made (the "Original Currency") no longer exists or the applicable Borrower is not able to make payment to the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, for the account of the applicable Lenders in such Original Currency, then all payments to be made by such Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document in such currency shall be made in such amount and such type of the New Currency as shall be equivalent (based upon market value) to the amount of such payment otherwise due hereunder or under such Loan Document in the Original Currency, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrowers take all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.07(f), if, after the making of any Advance in any currency other than Dollars, the applicable Borrower is not able to make payment to the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, for the account of the applicable Lenders in the type of currency in which such Advance was made (or in any New Currency as set forth above) because of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulation, then such Advance or reimbursement obligations shall instead be repaid when due in Dollars in a principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount (as of the date of repayment) of such Advance or such reimbursement 33
obligations. In the event any amount paid to any Lender hereunder is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, each Lender shall, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, repay to the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, the amount so paid to such Lender, with interest for the period commencing on the date such payment is returned by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, until the date the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, receives such repayment at a rate per annum equal to, during the period to but excluding the date two Business Days after such request, the Federal Funds Effective Rate, and thereafter, the Alternate Base Rate plus two percent (2%) per annum. (ii) Allocation Among the Lenders of Payments Received in Respect of Fronted Loans and Fronted Advances. Each Fronting Lender shall receive, for its own account, all payments or prepayments of principal with respect to its Fronted Loans; provided, however, upon the funding of the Purchasing Lenders' Participation Interests with respect to a Fronted Loan pursuant to Section 2.05(f), such Purchasing Lenders shall be deemed Fronting Lenders with respect to such Fronted Loan and shall be entitled to receive their pro rata share of any payment or prepayment of principal with respect to such Fronted Loan. Until the Purchasing Lenders are required to fund their Participation Interest in a Funded Loan, subject to Section 2.07(d), (i) the Fronting Lender that made such Fronted Loan shall receive interest on such Fronted Loan equal to (A) the Eurocurrency Base Rate for such Fronted Loan plus (B) its ratable share of the Eurocurrency Margin (in proportion to the ratio that its Commitment bears to the Aggregate Commitment) for such Fronted Loan plus (C) its MLA Cost for such Fronted Loan and (ii) each Purchasing Lender shall receive interest on such Fronted Loan in an amount equal to its ratable share of the Eurocurrency Margin (in proportion to the ratio that its Commitments bear to the Aggregate Commitment) for such Fronted Loan. After the Purchasing Lenders fund their Participation Interests in a Fronted Loan, subject to Section 2.07(d), each Fronting Lender with respect to such Fronted Loan shall receive interest on such Fronted Loan equal to (A) the Eurocurrency Base Rate for such Fronted Loan plus (B) its ratable share of the Eurocurrency Margin for such Fronted Loan plus (C) its MLA Cost for such Fronted Loan. For purposes of clarification, this Section 2.07(f)(ii) is intended to address the allocation among the Lenders of payments of principal and interest on Fronted Loans and Fronted Advances received from the Borrowers and is not intended to create any additional obligation of any Borrower hereunder. (g) Evidence of Debt; Telephonic Notices. Each Lender is hereby authorized to record in accordance with its usual practice, the date, the currency, the amount and the maturity of each of its Loans made hereunder; provided, however, that any failure to so record shall not affect any Borrower's obligations under this Credit Agreement. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent such 34
Lender's Loans shall be evidenced by a Note. Except as otherwise set forth herein, each Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to extend or continue Advances, effect selections of Types of Advances and transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any Person or Persons the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent or any Lender reasonably believes to be an Authorized Representative. If requested by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, or any Lender, each Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, a written confirmation of each telephonic notice given by it signed by an Authorized Representative. If the written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent and the Lenders shall govern absent manifest error. (h) Notification of Advances, Interest Rates and Prepayments. Promptly after receipt thereof, (i) the Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice, Aggregate Fronting Sublimit reduction notice, Committed Borrowing Notice, Dollar Continuation/Conversion Notice, Non-Dollar Continuation Conversion Notice, Competitive Bid Borrowing Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder and (ii) the Fronting Agent will notify each Fronting Lender of the contents of each Fronted Borrowing Notice and repayment notice received by it hereunder. In addition, (A) with respect to each Committed Borrowing Notice, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of its pro rata share of the Advance to be made pursuant to such Committed Borrowing Notice and (B) with respect to each Fronted Borrowing Notice, the Fronting Agent shall notify each Fronting Lender of its pro rata share of the Advance to be made pursuant to such Fronted Borrowing Notice. The Administrative Agent will notify the applicable Borrower and each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Fixed Rate Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give each Borrower and each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent's failure to give any such notice will not affect any Borrower's obligation to pay interest to the Lenders at the applicable interest rate. The Fronting Agent will notify Whirlpool, Whirlpool Finance and each Fronting Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Fronted Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate; provided, however, that the Fronting Agent's failure to give any such notice will not affect Whirlpool's or Whirlpool Finance's obligation to pay interest to the Fronting Lenders at the applicable interest rate. (i) Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent. Unless the applicable Borrower or Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, prior to the date on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, of (i) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a Loan or (ii) in the case of a Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or fees to the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, for the account of the applicable Lenders, that it does not intend to make such scheduled payment, the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, may assume that such scheduled payment has been made. The Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, 35
may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such scheduled payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If such Lender or Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such scheduled payment to the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, the recipient of such scheduled payment shall, on demand by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, repay to the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, until the date the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of such a repayment due from a Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day, or (y) in the case of such a repayment due from a Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan. (j) Market Disruption. Notwithstanding the satisfaction of all conditions referred to in Article 5 with respect to any Advance in any currency other than Dollars, if there shall occur on or prior to the date of such Advance any change in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls which would in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders make it impracticable for the Eurocurrency Committed Loans or Fronted Loans, as applicable, comprising such Advance to be denominated in the currency specified by the applicable Borrower, then the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to such Borrower and the Lenders, and such Loans shall not be denominated in such currency but shall, in the case of Eurocurrency Committed Loans, be made on such Borrowing Date as Floating Rate Loans or issued on such date in Dollars and, in the case of Fronted Loans, be made on such Borrowing Date as Fixed Rate Loans on such date in Dollars, in an aggregate principal amount or face amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount or face amount specified in the related Committed Borrowing Notice or Fronted Borrowing Notice, as applicable, unless such Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least one Business Day before such date that it elects not to borrow on such date. (k) Lending Installations. Subject to Section 3.06, each Lender may (i) from time to time book its Loans at any Lending Installation(s) selected by such Lender, and (ii) by written or telecopy notice to the Administrative Agent (and, if applicable, the Fronting Agent) and the Borrowers, designate (or change any such prior designation) a Lending Installation through which Loans of a particular Type will be made by it and for whose account payments on such Loans are to be made. All terms of this Credit Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and any Notes of a Lender shall be deemed held by such Lender for the benefit of its appropriate Lending Installation. Each Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (and, if applicable, the Fronting Agent) and Whirlpool on or prior to the date of this Credit Agreement of the Lending Installation which it intends to utilize for each Type and currency of Loan hereunder. (l) Withholding Tax Exemption. 36
(i) Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof shall: (A) (1) on or before the date of any payment by a Borrower incorporated in the United States under this Credit Agreement to such Lender, deliver to the Borrowers incorporated in the United States and the Administrative Agent two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or successor applicable form, as the case may be, certifying that it is entitled to receive payments under this Credit Agreement, including any fees, without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes; (2) deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent two further copies of any such form or certification on or before the date that any such form or certification expires or becomes obsolete and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Borrowers; and (3) obtain such extensions of time for filing and complete such forms or certifications as may reasonably be requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent; or (B) in the case of any such Lender that is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (1) represent to the Borrowers (for the benefit of the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent) that it is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (2) agree to furnish to the Borrowers, on or before the date of any payment by the Borrowers, with a copy to the Administrative Agent, two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or successor applicable form certifying to such Lender's legal entitlement at the date of such certificate to an exemption from U.S. withholding tax under the provisions of Section 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments to be made under this Credit Agreement (and to deliver to the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent two further copies of such form on or before the date it expires or becomes obsolete and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recently provided form and, if necessary, obtain any extensions of time reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent for filing and completing such forms), and (3) agree, to the extent legally entitled to do so, upon reasonable request by the Borrowers, to provide to the Borrowers (for the benefit of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent) such other forms as may be reasonably required in order to establish the legal entitlement of such Lender to an exemption from withholding with respect to payments under this Credit Agreement; provided, that any Lender that delivers the forms and representation provided in this clause (B) must also deliver to the Borrower or Administrative Agent two accurate, complete and signed copies of either Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or, in each case, an applicable successor form, establishing a complete exemption from withholding of United States federal income tax imposed on the payment of any fees, if applicable, to such Lender. 37
Notwithstanding the above, if any change in treaty, law or regulation has occurred after the date such Person becomes a Lender hereunder which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Lender so advises the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent then such Lender shall be exempt from such requirements. Each Person that shall become a Lender or a participant of a Lender pursuant to Section 13.02 or 13.03 shall, upon the effectiveness of the related transfer, be required to provide all of the forms, certifications and statements required pursuant to this subsection (i); provided that in the case of a participant of a Lender, the obligations of such participant of a Lender pursuant to this subsection (i) shall be determined as if the participant of a Lender were a Lender except that such participant of a Lender shall furnish all such required forms, certifications and statements to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased. (ii) If any withholding, deduction or other taxes (whether United States, Netherlands or otherwise) shall be or become applicable after the date of this Credit Agreement to any payments by the Borrowers to a Lender hereunder, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to make, fund or maintain the Loan or Loans, as the case may be, through another lending office located in another jurisdiction so as to reduce, to the fullest extent possible, the Borrowers' liability hereunder, if the making, funding or maintenance of such Loan or Loans through such other office does not, in the reasonable judgment of the Lender, materially affect the Lender of such Loan. (m) Allocation of the Aggregate Commitment Among the Borrowers. The Borrowers understand and agree that (i) subject to the terms and conditions of this Credit Agreement, the Lenders will honor Committed Borrowing Notices, Competitive Bid Borrowing Notices and Fronted Borrowing Notices in the order received by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, and (ii) as a result, one or more of the Borrowers may be unable to borrow or increase borrowings hereunder if other Borrowers have already borrowed hereunder in amounts which have caused the Dollar Amount of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans to equal the Aggregate Commitment. SECTION 2.08. BORROWING SUBSIDIARIES; ADDITIONAL BORROWING SUBSIDIARIES. Whirlpool may at any time or from time to time, with the consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, designate any of its Subsidiaries (other than any Subsidiary having its seat or its center of management in Austria) to become an "Additional Borrowing Subsidiary" (and thereby a "Borrowing Subsidiary" and a "Borrower") hereunder by satisfying the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.03. Upon satisfaction of such conditions precedent such Subsidiary shall for all purposes be a party hereto as a Borrower as fully as if it had executed and delivered this Credit Agreement. So long as the principal of and interest on any Advances made to any 38
Borrowing Subsidiary under this Credit Agreement shall have been repaid or paid in full and all other obligations of such Borrowing Subsidiary under this Credit Agreement shall have been fully performed, Whirlpool may, by not less than five Business Days' prior notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders thereof), terminate such Borrowing Subsidiary's status as a Borrower hereunder; provided, however, that Whirlpool shall concurrently terminate, if applicable, the status as a Borrower hereunder of any Subsidiary of the terminated Borrowing Subsidiary. SECTION 2.09. REGULATION D COMPENSATION. Each Lender may require each Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on its Eurocurrency Committed Loans and Fronted Loans, additional interest on the related Eurocurrency Committed Loan or Fronted Loan of such Lender at a rate per annum determined by such Lender up to but not exceeding the excess of (i) (A) the Eurocurrency Base Rate then in effect for such Loan divided by (B) one minus the Reserve Requirement applicable to such Lender over (ii) such Eurocurrency Base Rate. Any Lender wishing to require payment of such additional interest (x) shall so notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, in which case such additional interest on the Eurocurrency Committed Loans or Fronted Loans of such Lender to such Borrower shall be payable to such Lender at the place indicated in such notice with respect to each Interest Period commencing at least three Business Days after the giving of such notice and (y) shall notify such Borrower at least five Business Days prior to each date on which interest is payable on its Eurocurrency Committed Loans or Fronted Loans of the amount then due such Lender under this Section. ARTICLE 3 CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES SECTION 3.01. TAXES. (a) Payments to be Free and Clear. Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.01(c), all sums payable by each Borrower under the Loan Documents, whether in respect of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be paid without deduction for any present and future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings imposed by any government or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof (but excluding franchise taxes and any tax imposed on or measured by the net income, receipts, profits or gains of any Lender) and all interest, penalties or similar liabilities with respect thereto (collectively, "Taxes"), which amounts shall be paid by the applicable Borrower as provided in Section 3.01(b) below. The applicable Borrower will pay each Lender the amounts necessary such that the net amount of the principal, interest, fees or other sums received and retained by each Lender is not less than the amount payable under this Credit Agreement. (b) Grossing-up of Payments. Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.01(c), if: (i) any Borrower or any other Person is required by law to make any deduction or withholding on account of any Taxes from any sum paid or expressed to be payable by such Borrower to any 39
Lender under this Credit Agreement, or (ii) any party to this Credit Agreement (or any Person on its behalf) other than a Borrower is required by law to deduct or withhold any Tax from, or make a payment of Taxes with respect to, any such sum received or receivable by any Lender under this Credit Agreement: (A) the applicable party shall notify the Administrative Agent and, if such party is not the applicable Borrower, the Administrative Agent will notify the applicable Borrower of any such requirement or any change in any such requirement as soon as such party becomes aware of it; (B) the applicable Borrower shall pay all Taxes before the date on which penalties attached thereto become due and payable, such payment to be made (if the liability to pay is imposed on such Borrower) for its own account or (if that liability is imposed on any other party to this Credit Agreement) on behalf of and in the name of that party; (C) the sum payable by the applicable Borrower in respect of which the relevant deduction, withholding or payment is required shall (except, in the case of any such payment, to the extent that the amount thereof is not ascertainable when that sum is paid) be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of that deduction, withholding or payment, that party receives on the due date and retains (free from any liability in respect of any such deduction, withholding or payment of Taxes) a sum equal to that which it would have received and so retained had no such deduction, withholding or payment of Taxes been required or made; and (D) within thirty days after payment of any sum from which the applicable Borrower is required by law to make any deduction or withholding of Taxes, and within thirty days after the due date of payment of any Tax or other amount which it is required to pay pursuant to the foregoing subsection (B) of this Section 3.01(b), the applicable Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent all such certified documents and other evidence as to the making of such deduction, withholding or payment as (x) are satisfactory to the affected parties as proof of such deduction, withholding or payment and of the remittance thereof to the relevant taxing or other authority, and (y) are required by any such party to enable it to claim a tax credit with respect to such deduction, withholding or payment. (c) Conditions to Gross-up. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 3.01 to the contrary, no Borrower shall have any obligation to pay any Taxes pursuant to this Section 3.01, or to pay any amount to the Administrative Agent or any Lender pursuant to this Section 3.01, to the extent that such amount results from the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent or Fronting Agent to comply with its obligations pursuant to Section 2.07(l) or Section 13.05. 40
(d) Refunds. If any Lender receives a refund in respect of Taxes paid by any Borrower, it shall promptly pay such refund, together with any other amounts paid by such Borrower pursuant to Section 3.01 in connection with such refunded Taxes, to such Borrower, provided that such Borrower agrees to promptly return such refund to the applicable Lender after it receives notice from the applicable Lender that it is required to repay such refund. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to require any Lender to disclose confidential tax information. SECTION 3.02. INCREASED COSTS. If, at any time after the date of this Credit Agreement, the adoption of any applicable law or the application of any applicable governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof, or the compliance of any Lender therewith, (i) imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve, assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation (other than amounts paid pursuant to Section 2.09 and other than reserves and assessments taken into account in determining the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency Committed Advances or Fronted Advances), or (ii) imposes any other condition (not being included within the Taxes covered by Section 3.01), the result of which is to increase the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation of making, funding or maintaining Eurocurrency Loans or reduces any amount receivable by any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation in connection with Eurocurrency Loans, or requires any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of Eurocurrency Loans held or interest received by it, by an amount deemed material by such Lender, then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender, the applicable Borrower or Whirlpool shall pay such Lender that portion of such increased expense incurred or reduction in an amount received which such Lender determines is attributable to making, funding and maintaining its Eurocurrency Loans and its Commitment to make Eurocurrency Loans or issue; provided, however, that any amount payable pursuant to this Section 3.02 shall be limited to the amount incurred from and after the date one hundred fifty days prior to the date that such Lender makes such demand; and provided, further, that any amount payable pursuant to this Section 3.02 shall be paid by the applicable Borrower to the extent that such amount is reasonably allocable to such Borrower and the Advances made to it and shall otherwise be payable by Whirlpool. SECTION 3.03. CHANGES IN CAPITAL ADEQUACY REGULATIONS. If a Lender determines that the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender, any Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender is increased as a result of a Change (as hereafter defined), then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the applicable Borrower or 41
Whirlpool shall pay such Lender the amount which such Lender reasonably determines is necessary to compensate it for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such increased capital which such Lender determines is attributable to this Credit Agreement, its Loans or its obligation to make Loans hereunder (after taking into account such Lender's policies as to capital adequacy); provided, however, that any amount payable pursuant to this Section 3.03 shall be limited to the amount incurred from and after the date one hundred fifty days prior to the date that such Lender makes such demand; and provided, further, that any amount payable pursuant to this Section 3.02 shall be paid by the applicable Borrower to the extent that such amount is reasonably allocable to such Borrower and the Advances made to it and shall otherwise be payable by Whirlpool. "Change" means (i) any change after the date of this Credit Agreement in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines (as hereafter defined), or (ii) any adoption of or change in any other law, governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline, interpretation, or directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the date of this Credit Agreement which affects the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any Lender or any Lending Installation or any corporation controlling any Lender. "Risk-Based Capital Guidelines" means (x) the risk-based capital guidelines in effect in the United States on the date of this Credit Agreement, including transition rules, and (y) the corresponding capital regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities outside the United States in effect on the date of this Credit Agreement, including transition rules. SECTION 3.04. AVAILABILITY OF TYPES AND CURRENCIES. If any Lender determines that maintenance at a suitable Lending Installation of any Type of its Eurocurrency Loans denominated in any Agreed Currency would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation or directive, whether or not having the force of law, and notifies the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent of such determination, then the affected currency shall cease to be an Agreed Currency and the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent shall suspend the availability of the affected Type and currency of Advance and, if such Lender determines that it is necessary, require that any Eurocurrency Loan of the affected Type and currency be repaid. If any Lender determines that deposits of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurocurrency Committed Advances or Fronted Advances denominated in any Agreed Currency are not available, then the affected currency shall cease to be an Agreed Currency and the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent shall suspend the availability of Eurocurrency Committed Advances or Fronted Advances denominated in the affected currency. If any Lender determines that the combination of the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency Committed Advances and Fronted Advances denominated in any Agreed Currency and payments due pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.02 with respect to such Eurocurrency Committed Advances or such Fronted Advances does not accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining Eurocurrency Committed Advances and Fronted Advances in the affected currency, then the affected currency shall cease to be an Agreed Currency and the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent shall suspend the availability of Eurocurrency Committed Advances and Fronted Advances denominated in the affected currency. SECTION 3.05. FUNDING INDEMNIFICATION. If any payment of a Fixed Rate Loan occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period, whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a Fixed Rate Loan is not made on the date specified by the applicable Borrower for any reason other than default by a Lender, such Borrower will indemnify each Lender for any loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, any loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain such Fixed Rate Loan (but excluding loss of profits). 42
SECTION 3.06. MITIGATION OF ADDITIONAL COSTS OR ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES. If, in respect of any Lender, circumstances arise which would or would upon the giving of notice result in: (i) an increase in the liability of a Borrower to such Lender under Section 3.01, 3.02 or 3.03; (ii) the unavailability of a Type or currency of Committed Advance or Fronted Advance under Section 3.04; or (iii) a Lender being unable to deliver the forms required by Section 2.07(l); then, without in any way limiting, reducing or otherwise qualifying the applicable Borrower's obligations under any of the Sections referred to above in this Section 3.06, such Lender shall promptly upon becoming aware of the same notify the Administrative Agent thereof and shall, in consultation with the Administrative Agent and Whirlpool and to the extent that it can do so without disadvantaging itself, take such reasonable steps as may be reasonably open to it to mitigate the effects of such circumstances (including, without limitation, the designation of an alternate Lending Installation or the transfer of its Loans to another Lending Installation). If and so long as a Lender has been unable to take, or has not taken, steps acceptable to Whirlpool to mitigate the effect of the circumstances in question, such Lender shall be obliged, at the request and expense of Whirlpool, to assign all its rights and obligations hereunder to another Person nominated by Whirlpool with the approval of the Administrative Agent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) and willing to participate in the facility in place of such Lender; provided that (i) all obligations owed to such assigning Lender shall be paid in full and (ii) such Person satisfies all of the requirements of this Credit Agreement including, but not limited to, providing the forms required by Sections 2.07(l) and 13.03(b). Notwithstanding any such assignment, the obligations of the Borrowers under Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03 and 10.06 shall survive any such assignment and be enforceable by such Lender. SECTION 3.07. LENDER STATEMENTS; SURVIVAL OF INDEMNITY. Each Lender shall deliver to the applicable Borrower and Whirlpool a written statement of such Lender as to the amount due, if any, under Section 3.01, 3.02, 3.03 or 3.05. Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the applicable Borrower in the absence of manifest error. Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a Fixed Rate Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded its Fixed Rate Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type and 43
maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the Fixed Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written statement shall be payable within 15 days after receipt by the applicable Borrower and Whirlpool of the written statement. The obligations of any Borrower under Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03 or 3.05 shall survive payment of any other of such Borrower's Obligations and the termination of this Credit Agreement. ARTICLE 4 GUARANTY SECTION 4.01. GUARANTY. For valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, and to induce the Lenders to make Advances to each of the Borrowing Subsidiaries, Whirlpool hereby irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally guarantees prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of any and all existing and future obligations of each of the Borrowing Subsidiaries to the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, under or with respect to the Loan Documents, whether for principal, interest (including, without limitation, all interest accruing subsequent to the commencement of any case, proceeding or other action relating to any Borrowing Subsidiary under the Bankruptcy Code or any similar law with respect to the bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of any Borrowing Subsidiary, and all interest which, but for any such case, proceeding or other action would otherwise accrue), fees, expenses or otherwise (collectively, the "Guaranteed Obligations"). Whirlpool also agrees that all payments under this guaranty shall be made in the same currency and manner as provided herein for the Guaranteed Obligations. SECTION 4.02. WAIVERS. Whirlpool waives notice of the acceptance of this guaranty and of the extension or continuation of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof. Whirlpool further waives presentment, protest, notice of notices delivered or demand made on any Borrowing Subsidiary or action or delinquency in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, including any right to require the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent and the Lenders to sue any Borrowing Subsidiary, any other guarantor or any other Person obligated with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, or otherwise to enforce payment thereof against any collateral securing the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof. SECTION 4.03. GUARANTY ABSOLUTE. This guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not of collection, it is a primary obligation of Whirlpool and not one of surety, and the validity and enforceability of this guaranty shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and shall not be impaired or affected by, any of the following: (a) any extension, modification or renewal of, or indulgence with respect to, or substitutions for, the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or any 44
agreement relating thereto at any time; (b) any failure or omission to enforce any right, power or remedy with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto, or any collateral; (c) any waiver of any right, power or remedy or of any default with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto, or any collateral; (d) any release, surrender, compromise, settlement, waiver, subordination or modification, with or without consideration, of any collateral, any other guaranties with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, or any other obligation of any Person with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (e) the enforceability or validity of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or the genuineness, enforceability or validity of any agreement relating thereto or with respect to any collateral; (f) the application of payments received from any source to the payment of obligations other than the Guaranteed Obligations, any part thereof or amounts which are not covered by this guaranty even though the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent and the Lenders might lawfully have elected to apply such payments to any part or all of the Guaranteed Obligations or to amounts which are not covered by this guaranty; (g) any change in the ownership of any Borrowing Subsidiary or the insolvency, bankruptcy or any other change in the legal status of any Borrowing Subsidiary; (h) the change in or the imposition of any law, decree, regulation or other governmental act which does or might impair, delay or in any way affect the validity, enforceability or payment when due of the Guaranteed Obligations; (i) the failure of Whirlpool or any Borrowing Subsidiary to maintain in full force, validity or effect or to obtain or renew when required all governmental and other approvals, licenses or consents required in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations or this guaranty, or to take any other action required in connection with the performance of all obligations pursuant to the Guaranteed Obligations or this guaranty; (j) the existence of any claim, setoff or other rights which Whirlpool may have at any time against any Borrowing Subsidiary, or any other Person in connection herewith or an unrelated transaction; or (k) any other circumstances, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, which could constitute a defense to a guarantor; all whether or not Whirlpool shall have had notice or knowledge of any act or omission referred to in the foregoing clauses (a) through (k) of this Section 4.03. It is agreed that Whirlpool's liability hereunder is several and independent of any other guaranties or other obligations at any time in effect with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof and that Whirlpool's liability hereunder may be enforced regardless of the existence, validity, enforcement or non-enforcement of any such other guaranties or other obligations or any provision of any applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit payment by any Borrowing Subsidiary of the Guaranteed Obligations in the manner agreed upon between such Borrowing Subsidiary and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. SECTION 4.04. CONTINUING GUARANTY. The Lenders may make or continue Loans to any of the Borrowing Subsidiaries from time to time without notice to or authorization from Whirlpool regardless of the financial or other condition of any Borrowing Subsidiary at the time any Loan is made or continued, and no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose or discuss with Whirlpool its assessment of the financial condition of any of the Borrowing Subsidiaries. This guaranty shall continue in effect, notwithstanding any extensions, modifications, renewals or indulgences with respect to, or substitution for, the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been paid in full and all of the Commitments shall have expired or been terminated. 45
SECTION 4.05. DELAY OF SUBROGATION. Until the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full, Whirlpool shall not exercise any right of subrogation with respect to payments made by Whirlpool pursuant to this guaranty. SECTION 4.06. ACCELERATION. Whirlpool agrees that, as between Whirlpool on the one hand, and the Lenders, the Fronting Agent and the Administrative Agent, on the other hand, the obligations of any Borrowing Subsidiary guaranteed under this Article 4 may be declared to be forthwith due and payable, or may be deemed automatically to have been accelerated, as provided in Section 9.01 for purposes of this Article 4, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition (whether in a bankruptcy proceeding affecting such Borrowing Subsidiary or otherwise) preventing such declaration as against such Borrowing Subsidiary and that, in the event of such declaration or automatic acceleration, such obligations (whether or not due and payable by such Borrowing Subsidiary) shall forthwith become due and payable by Whirlpool for purposes of this Article 4. SECTION 4.07. REINSTATEMENT. The obligations of Whirlpool under this Article 4 shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and Whirlpool agrees that it will indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent and each Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent or such Lender in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law. ARTICLE 5 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT Section 5.01. Closing. This Credit Agreement shall not be effective until a date (the "Closing Date") upon which each Borrower which is an original signatory hereto (each, an "Original Borrower" and collectively, the "Original Borrowers") has furnished or caused to be furnished to the Administrative Agent the following: 46

To ensure the legality, validity, enforceability or admissibility in evidence of each such Loan Document in such jurisdiction, it is not necessary that any such Loan Document or any other document be filed or recorded with any court or other authority of such jurisdiction or that any stamp or similar tax be paid on or in respect of any such Loan Documents.

than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of such Person on its debts as they become absolute and matured. In computing the amount of contingent liabilities at any time, it is intended that such liabilities will be computed at the amount which, in light of all the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability. SECTION 6.17 TAX SHELTER REGULATIONS. The Borrowers do not intend to treat the Advances as being a "reportable transaction" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4).

ARTICLE 9 ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES Section 9.01. Acceleration; Allocation of Payments after Acceleration. (a) If any Default described in Section 8.05 or 8.06 occurs, the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder shall automatically terminate and the Obligations of the Borrowers shall immediately become due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind (all of which each Borrower hereby expressly waives) or any other election or action on the part of the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent or any Lender. If any other Default occurs, the Required Lenders may (i) terminate or suspend the obligations of the 65
Lenders to make Loans hereunder or (ii) declare the Obligations of the Borrowers to be due and payable, or both, in each case upon written notice to the Borrowers, whereupon such obligations shall terminate or be suspended, as the case may be, and/or the Obligations shall become immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of which each Borrower hereby expressly waives. (b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Credit Agreement, after acceleration of the Obligations, all amounts collected or received by the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent or any Lender on account of amounts outstanding under any of the Loan Documents shall be paid over or delivered as follows: FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) of the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent or any of the Lenders in connection with enforcing the rights of the Lenders under the Loan Documents; SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent or any Lender; THIRD, to the payment of all accrued interest payable to the Lenders hereunder; FOURTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the Advances, pro rata, as set forth below; FIFTH, to all other obligations which shall have become due and payable under the Credit Documents and not repaid pursuant to clauses "FIRST" through "FOURTH" above; and SIXTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus. In carrying out the foregoing, (a) amounts received shall be applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next succeeding category and (b) each of the Lenders shall receive an amount equal to its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the then outstanding Advances held by such Lender bears to the aggregate then outstanding Advances) of amounts available to be applied pursuant to clauses "FIRST", "THIRD," "FOURTH" and "FIFTH" above. SECTION 9.02. JUDGMENT CURRENCY. (i) The Borrowers' obligations under the Credit Documents to make payments in an applicable Agreed Currency (the "Obligation Currency") shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender or recovery pursuant to any judgment expressed in or converted into any currency other than the Obligation Currency, except to the extent that such tender or recovery results in the effective receipt by the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent or a Lender of the full 66
amount of the Obligation Currency expressed to be payable to the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent or such Lender under the Credit Documents. If, for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment against any Borrower in any court or in any jurisdiction, it becomes necessary to convert into or from any currency other than the Obligation Currency (such other currency being hereinafter referred to as the "Judgment Currency") an amount due in the Obligation Currency, the conversion shall be made at the Dollar Amount, determined as of the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which the judgment is given (such Business Day being hereinafter referred to as the "Judgment Currency Conversion Date"). (ii) If there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing between the Judgment Currency Conversion Date and the date of actual payment of the amount due, such amount payable by the applicable Borrower shall be reduced or increased, as applicable, such that the amount paid in the Judgment Currency, when converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment, will produce the amount of the Obligation Currency which could have been purchased with the amount of Judgment Currency stipulated in the judgment or judicial award at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Judgment Currency Conversion Date. Each Borrower agrees to pay any additional amounts payable by it under this subsection (ii) as a separate obligation notwithstanding any such judgment or judicial award. SECTION 9.03. AMENDMENTS. Subject to the provisions of this Article 9, the Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with the consent in writing of the Required Lenders) and the Borrowers may enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or the Borrowers hereunder or waiving any Default hereunder; provided, however, that no such supplemental agreement shall without the consent of each Lender directly or indirectly affected thereby: (i) Extend the maturity of any Loan or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of any interest thereon; (ii) Reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of any fees due hereunder or amounts due under Section 3.01, 3.02, 3.03 or 3.05; (iii) Increase the percentage specified in clause (i) in the definition of Required Lenders or reduce the percentage specified in clause (ii) in the definition of Required Lenders; (iv) Extend the Termination Date or increase the amount of the Commitment of any Lender hereunder, or permit any Borrower to assign its rights under this Credit Agreement; (v) Amend, modify or waive Section 9.01, this Section 9.03, or Article 12; or (vi) Release Whirlpool from its Guaranteed Obligations. 67

No amendment of any provision of this Credit Agreement relating to the Fronting Agent shall be effective without the written consent of the Fronting Agent.

The Administrative Agent may waive payment of the fee required under Section 13.03(b) without obtaining the consent of any of the Lenders. SECTION 9.04. PRESERVATION OF RIGHTS. No delay or omission of the Lenders, the Fronting Agent or the Administrative Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and the making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of a Default or the inability of any Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Loan shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable, pursuant to Section 9.03, and then only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies contained in the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be available to the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent and the Lenders until the Obligations have been paid in full. ARTICLE 10 GENERAL PROVISIONS SECTION 10.01. SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS. All representations and warranties of the Borrowers contained in this Credit Agreement shall survive the making of the Loans herein contemplated. SECTION 10.02. GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION.

SECTION 10.05. SEVERAL OBLIGATIONS. The respective obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent is authorized to act as such). The failure of any Lender to perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from any of its obligations hereunder. No Lender shall have any liability for the failure of any other Lender to perform its obligations hereunder. This Credit Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer any right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to this Credit Agreement and their respective successors and assigns. SECTION 10.06. EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION. Whirlpool shall reimburse the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent for any costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent in connection with the preparation, negotiation review, execution, delivery, amendment, modification and administration of the Loan Documents. Whirlpool also agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent and the Lenders for any costs, internal charges and out-of- pocket expenses (including attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys for the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent and the Lenders, which attorneys may be employees of the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent or any Lender) paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent or any Lender in connection with the collection and enforcement of the Loan Documents. Whirlpool further agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent and each Lender and each of their respective directors, officers, affiliates, agents and employees (each an "Indemnified Person") against all losses, claims, damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, all expenses of litigation or preparation therefor whether or not the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent a Lender or any other Indemnified Person is a party thereto) which any of them may pay or incur arising out of or relating to the Loan Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby or the direct or indirect application or proposed application of the proceeds of any Loan hereunder; provided, however, that Whirlpool shall not be liable to any Indemnified Person for any such loss, claim, damage, penalty, judgment, liability or expense resulting from such Indemnified Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Notwithstanding anything in this Credit Agreement to the contrary, Whirlpool shall indemnify the Lenders for all losses, taxes (including withholding taxes), liabilities and expenses incurred or arising out of making Advances in Agreed Currencies other than Dollars. The obligations of Whirlpool under this Section 10.06 shall survive the termination of this Credit Agreement. 69
SECTION 10.07. SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. Any provision in any Loan Document that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared to be severable. SECTION 10.08. NONLIABILITY OF LENDERS. The relationship between the Borrowers and the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent shall be solely that of borrower and lender. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to any Borrower. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent nor any Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Borrowers to review or inform any of the Borrowers of any matter in connection with any phase of the business or operations of any of the Borrowers. SECTION 10.09. CHOICE OF LAW. THE LOAN DOCUMENTS SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. SECTION 10.10. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. (a) EACH BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL OR NEW YORK STATE COURT SITTING IN NEW YORK CITY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENTS AND EACH BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN ANY SUCH COURT AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW ANY OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE AS TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT OR THAT SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE FRONTING AGENT OR ANY LENDER TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST A BORROWER IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BY A BORROWER AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE FRONTING AGENT OR ANY LENDER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE FRONTING AGENT OR ANY LENDER INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN A COURT IN NEW YORK CITY, UNLESS SUCH BORROWER IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH JURISDICTION. 70
(b) Each Borrowing Subsidiary domiciled outside of the United States (a "Foreign Borrower") hereby irrevocably appoints Whirlpool as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact (the "Service of Process Agent") in its name, place and stead to accept service of any and all writs, summons and other legal process and any such enforcement proceeding brought in the State of New York and agrees that service by the mailing, of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to it at the address for notices pursuant to Section V, such service to become effective 30 days after such mailing, of any enforcement proceeding may be made upon such Service of Process Agent and that it will take such action as necessary to continue such appointment in full force and effect or to appoint another such Service of Process Agent satisfactory to the Administrative Agent for service of process. Whirlpool hereby irrevocably accepts such appointment and agrees to serve in the capacity of Service of Process Agent.

Upon the request and submission of any controversy or claim for arbitration hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall give such Foreign Borrower not less than 45 days written notice of the request for arbitration, the nature of the controversy or claim, and the time and place set for arbitration. Such Foreign Borrower agrees that such notice is reasonable to enable it sufficient time to prepare and present its case before the arbitration panel. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitration panel may be entered in any court including, without limitation, any court of the State of New York or any federal court sitting in the State of New York. The expenses of arbitration shall be paid by such Foreign Borrower.

Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Fronting Agent shall have any implied duties to the Lenders or any obligation to the Lenders to take any action thereunder except any action specifically provided by the Loan Documents to be taken by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable. 73
SECTION 11.03. GENERAL IMMUNITY. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent, the Syndication Agent, any Documentation Agent nor any of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable to any of the Borrowers, the Lenders or any Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with the Loan Documents except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. SECTION 11.04. NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOANS, RECITALS, ETC. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent, the Syndication Agent, any Documentation Agent nor any of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into or verify (i) any statement, warranty or representation made by any other Person in connection with any Loan Document or any extension of credit hereunder; (ii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of any other Person under any Loan Document; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article 5, except receipt of items required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable; or (iv) the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability (other than its own execution and delivery), genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the perfection or priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to be created under or in connection with, this Credit Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent, the Syndication Agent nor any Documentation Agent shall have any duty to disclose to the Lenders information that is not required to be furnished by a Borrower to the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent at such time, but is voluntarily furnished by any Borrower to the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent, the Syndication Agent or any Documentation Agent (either in its capacity as Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent, Syndication Agent or Documentation Agent, as the case may be, or in its individual capacity). Neither the Syndication Agent, any Documentation Agent, the Co-Lead Arrangers nor the Joint Book Managers shall have any duties or obligations in that capacity under the Loan Documents. SECTION 11.05. ACTION ON INSTRUCTIONS OF LENDERS. The Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by the Required Lenders or all the Lenders, as applicable, and such instructions and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder and under any other Loan Document unless it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and all liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action, provided that such indemnity shall not include liability, costs and expenses arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable. 74
SECTION 11.06. EMPLOYMENT OF AGENTS AND COUNSEL. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent may execute any of its duties as Administrative Agent or as the Fronting Agent, as applicable, hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the Lenders, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to the agency hereby created and its duties hereunder and under any other Loan Document. SECTION 11.07. RELIANCE ON DOCUMENTS; COUNSEL. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any Note, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, statement, paper or document reasonably and in good faith believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and, in respect to legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, which counsel may be employees of the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent. SECTION 11.08. REIMBURSEMENT AND INDEMNIFICATION. The Lenders agree to reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent ratably in proportion to their respective Commitments for (i) any amounts not reimbursed by the Borrowers for which the Administrative Agent (acting as such) or the Fronting Agent (acting as such) is entitled to reimbursement by the Borrowers under the Loan Documents, (ii) for any other expenses not reimbursed by the Borrowers incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents, and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever and not reimbursed by the Borrowers which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (acting as such) or the Fronting Agent (acting as such) in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby, or the enforcement of any of the terms thereof or of any such other documents, provided that no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable. SECTION 11.09. RIGHTS AS A LENDER. With respect to its respective Commitment, Loans made by it, and any Notes issued to it, the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent, the Syndication Agent and each Documentation Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan Document as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent, the Syndication Agent or a Documentation Agent, as the case may be, and 75
the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent, the Syndication Agent and each Documentation Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender. The Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent, the Syndication Agent, each Documentation Agent and each Lender may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in addition to those contemplated by this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, with any Borrower or any Subsidiary of a Borrower. SECTION 11.10. LENDER CREDIT DECISION. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent, the Syndication Agent, any Documentation Agent or any other Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by Whirlpool and the other Borrowers and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent, the Syndication Agent, any Documentation Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents. SECTION 11.11. SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT/FRONTING AGENT. Each of the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrowers, such resignation to be effective upon the appointment of a successor Administrative Agent or Fronting Agent, as applicable. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint (with, so long as no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the consent of Whirlpool, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), on behalf of the Borrowers and the Lenders, a successor Administrative Agent or Fronting Agent, as applicable. If no successor Administrative Agent or Fronting Agent, as applicable, shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty days after the resigning Administrative Agent's or Fronting Agent's, as applicable, giving notice of its resignation, then such resignation shall nevertheless become effective and thereafter the Lenders shall perform all duties of the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Agent, as applicable, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor in accordance with the terms above. No successor Administrative Agent or Fronting Agent shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until such successor has accepted the appointment. Any successor Administrative Agent shall be a commercial bank having capital and retained earnings of at least $100,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any 76
appointment as Administrative Agent or as Fronting Agent, as applicable, hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent or Fronting Agent, as applicable, such successor shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning Administrative Agent or resigning Fronting Agent, as applicable. Upon the effectiveness of the resignation of an Administrative Agent or a Fronting Agent, the resigning Person shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the resignation of any Administrative Agent or Fronting Agent, the provisions of this Article 11 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent or Fronting Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. ARTICLE 12 SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS SECTION 12.01. SETOFF. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of the Lenders under applicable law, if any Borrower becomes insolvent, however evidenced, or any Default (or Unmatured Default pursuant to Section 8.02, 8.05 or 8.06) occurs, any and all deposits (including all account balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or available) and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender to or for the credit or account of any Borrower may be offset and applied toward the payment of the Obligations owing to such Lender, whether or not the Obligations, or any part thereof, shall then be due, matured or unmatured, contingent or non-contingent. SECTION 12.02. RATABLE PAYMENTS. If, after the occurrence of a Default, any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise, has payment made to it upon its share of any Advance (other than a Competitive Bid Advance) in a greater proportion than that received by any other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a portion of the Loans comprising such Advance held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase each Lender will hold its ratable proportion of Loans comprising such Advance. The Lenders further agree among themselves that if payment to a Lender obtained by such Lender through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim or other event as aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Lender which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by payment in cash or a repurchase of a participation theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit (together with its share of any accrued interest payable with respect thereto) to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored. The Borrowers agree that any Lender so purchasing such a participation may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan or other obligation in the amount of such participation. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Credit Agreement, if any Lender or the Administrative Agent shall fail to remit to the Administrative Agent or any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender or the Administrative Agent to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender pursuant to this Credit Agreement on the date when such amount is due, such payments shall be made together with interest thereon if paid within two Business Days of the date when such amount is due at a per annum rate equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate and thereafter at a per annum rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender. If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section 12.02 applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders under this Section 12.02 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim. 77
ARTICLE 13 BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; PARTICIPATIONS; ASSIGNMENTS; REPRESENTATION OF THE LENDERS SECTION 13.01. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The terms and provisions of the Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrowers, the Lenders, the Fronting Agent and the Administrative Agent and their respective successors and assigns, except that (i) no Borrower shall have the right to assign its rights or obligations under the Loan Documents, and (ii) any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance with Section 13.03. Notwithstanding clause (ii) of this Section, any Lender may at any time, without the consent of any Borrower, the Syndication Agent, the Documentation Agents, the Fronting Agent or the Administrative Agent, assign all or any portion of its rights under this Credit Agreement and its Notes, if any, to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided, however, that no such assignment shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder. The Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent may treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until such payee complies with Section 13.03 in the case of an assignment thereof or, in the case of any other transfer, a written notice of the transfer is filed with the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent. Any assignee or transferee of a Lender's rights or obligations hereunder agrees by acceptance thereof to be bound by all the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents. Any request, authority or consent of any Person, who at the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the holder of any Note, shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of such Note or of any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor. SECTION 13.02. PARTICIPATIONS. (a) Permitted Participations; Effect. Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants") participating interests in all or a portion of its rights, obligations or rights and obligations under the Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, all amounts payable by the Borrowers under this Credit Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participating interests, and the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents. 78
(b) Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the sole right to approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Loan or Commitment in which such Participant has an interest which forgives principal, interest or fees or reduces the interest rate or fees payable with respect to any such Loan or Commitment, postpones any date fixed for any regularly-scheduled payment of principal of, or interest or fees on, any such Loan or Commitment, releases any guarantor of any such Loan or releases any substantial portion of collateral, if any, securing any such Loan. (c) Benefit of Setoff. The Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section 12.01 in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents, provided that each Lender shall retain the right of setoff provided in Section 12.01 with respect to the amount of participating interests sold to each Participant. The Lenders agree to share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the right of setoff provided in Section 12.01, agrees to share with each Lender, any amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance with Section 12.02 as if each Participant were a Lender. SECTION 13.03. ASSIGNMENTS. (a) Permitted Assignments. Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time assign to one or more banks or other entities ("Purchasers") any part of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents; provided that, no assignment may be made without the prior written consent of Whirlpool and the Administrative Agent in their sole discretion, unless (i) such Lender retains at all times a Commitment which, is not less than $15,000,000 (unless such Lender is assigning all of its Commitment), (ii) each such assignment to any Purchaser of any portion of such Lender's Commitment shall be in an amount which is not less than $15,000,000 (or, if less, the remaining amount of its Commitment) and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (iii) such Lender has provided Whirlpool with three Business Days prior notice of such assignment, including such information regarding the Purchaser as Whirlpool may reasonably request, and Whirlpool has confirmed, on behalf of the Dutch Borrowers, that the Purchaser has the status of a Professional Market Party. For purposes of clause (iii) above, if Whirlpool does not raise any objection within the three Business Day period, it shall be deemed to have confirmed that the Purchaser is a Professional Market Party. Each such assignment shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit "F" hereto or in such other form as may be agreed to by the parties thereto. The consent of Whirlpool and the Administrative Agent shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an affiliate thereof; provided, however, that if a Default has occurred and is continuing, the consent of Whirlpool shall not be required. No consents required by this Section 13.03(a) shall be unreasonably withheld. 79
(b) Effect; Effective Date. Upon (i) delivery to the Administrative Agent of a notice of assignment substantially in the form attached as Annex "I" to Exhibit "F" hereto (a "Notice of Assignment"), together with any consent required by Section 13.03(a), (ii) payment of a $3,500 processing fee to the Administrative Agent for processing such assignment and (iii) recordation of such assignment in the Register as required by Section 13.03(c), such assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified in such Notice of Assignment. The Notice of Assignment shall contain a representation by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the consideration used to make the purchase of the Commitment, Loans and Participation Interests under the applicable assignment agreement are "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and that the rights and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will not be "plan assets" under ERISA. On and after the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this Credit Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by the Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party hereto, and no further consent or action by the Borrowers, the Lenders or the Administrative Agent shall be required to release the transferor Lender with respect to the percentage of the Aggregate Commitment, Loans and Participation Interests assigned to such Purchaser. (c) Register. The Borrowers hereby designate the Administrative Agent to serve as the Borrowers' agent, solely for the purpose of this paragraph, to maintain a register (the "Register") on which the Administrative Agent will record each Lender's Commitment, the Loans made by each Lender, and each repayment in respect of the principal amount of the Loans of each Lender and annexed to which the Administrative Agent shall retain a copy of Notice of Assignment delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 13.03(b). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person in whose name a Loan is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes of this Credit Agreement, notwithstanding notice or any provisions herein to the contrary. A Lender's Commitment and the Loans made pursuant thereto may be assigned or otherwise transferred in whole or in part only by registration of such assignment or transfer in the Register. Any assignment or transfer of a Lender's Commitment or the Loans made pursuant thereto shall be registered in the Register only upon delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Notice of Assignment duly executed by the assignor thereof. No assignment or transfer of a Lender's Commitment or the Loans made pursuant thereto shall be effective unless such assignment or transfer shall have been recorded in the Register by the Administrative Agent as provided in this Section. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. SECTION 13.04. DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION. Each Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender's possession concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries. 80
SECTION 13.05. TAX TREATMENT. If any interest in any Loan Document is transferred to any Transferee, the transferor Lender shall cause such Transferee, as a condition to such transfer, to comply with the provisions of Section 2.07(l). SECTION 13.06. SPC'S. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an "SPC") the option to fund all or any part of any Advance that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to fund pursuant to this Credit Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Advance, (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to fund all or any part of such Advance, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to fund such Advance pursuant to the terms hereof, (iii) no SPC shall have any voting rights pursuant to Section 9.03 (all such voting rights shall be retained by the Granting Lenders), (iv) with respect to notices, payments and other matters hereunder, the Credit Parties, the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent and the Lenders shall not be obligated to deal with an SPC, but may limit their communications and other dealings relevant to such SPC to the applicable Granting Lender and (v) the Granting Lender has provided Whirlpool with three Business Days prior notice of such assignment, including such information regarding the SPC as Whirlpool may reasonably request, and Whirlpool has confirmed, on behalf of the Dutch Borrowers, that the SPC has the status of a Professional Market Party. For purposes of clause (v) above, if Whirlpool does not raise any objection within the three Business Day period, it shall be deemed to have confirmed that the SPC is a Professional Market Party. The funding of an Advance by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent that, and as if, such Advance were funded by such Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or payment under this Credit Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable for so long as, and to the extent, the Granting Lender provides such indemnity or makes such payment. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreements shall survive termination of this Credit Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Credit Agreement, any SPC may disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its funding of Advances to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancements to such SPC. This Section may not be amended without the prior written consent of each Granting Lender, all or any part of whose Advance is being funded by an SPC at the time of such amendment. SECTION 13.07 REPRESENTATION OF THE LENDERS. Each Lender represents and warrants to each of the Dutch Borrowers that such Lender is a Professional Market Party. 81
ARTICLE 14 NOTICES SECTION 14.01. GIVING NOTICE. (a) Except as otherwise permitted by Section 2.07(g) or as provided in subsection (b) below, all notices and other communications provided to any party hereto under this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be in writing or by telecopy (and promptly confirmed) and addressed or delivered to such party at its address set forth on Schedule V hereto or at such other address as may be designated by such party in a notice to the other parties. Any notice, if mailed and properly addressed with postage prepaid, or sent overnight delivery via a reputable carrier, shall be deemed given when received; any notice, if transmitted by telecopy, shall be deemed given when transmitted. (b) So long as Citibank or any of its Affiliates is the Administrative Agent, materials required to be delivered pursuant to Section 7.01(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent in an electronic or other acceptable medium in a format acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders by e-mail at oploanswebadmin@citigroup.com or if by another medium to the address of the Administrative Agent. In the event such materials are transmitted to such e-mail address such transmission shall satisfy the Borrowers' obligation to deliver such materials. The Borrowers agree that the Administrative Agent may make such materials, as well as any other written information, documents, instruments and other material relating to the Borrowers, any of their Subsidiaries or any other materials or matters relating to this Credit Agreement, the Notes or any of the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the "Communications") available to the Lenders by posting such notices on Intralinks or a substantially similar electronic system (the "Platform"). The Borrowers acknowledge that (i) the distribution of material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure and that there are confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution, (ii) the Platform is provided "as is" and "as available" and (iii) neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Affiliates warrants the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of the Communications or the Platform and each expressly disclaims liability for errors or omissions in the Communications or the Platform. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including, without limitation, any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made by the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in connection with the Platform. (c) Each Lender agrees that notice to it (as provided in the next sentence) (a "Notice") specifying that any Communications have been posted to the Platform shall constitute effective delivery of such information, documents or other materials to such Lender for purposes of this Credit Agreement; provided that if requested by any Lender the Administrative Agent shall deliver a copy of the Communications to such Lender by email or telecopier. Each Lender agrees (i) to notify the Administrative Agent in writing of such Lender's e-mail address to which a Notice may be sent by electronic transmission (including by electronic communication) on or before the date such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter to ensure that the Administrative Agent has on record an effective e-mail address for such Lender) and (ii) that any Notice may be sent to such e-mail address. 82
SECTION 14.02. CHANGE OF ADDRESS. Subject to Section 10.10(b), each Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent and each Lender may change the address for service of notice upon it by a notice in writing to the other parties hereto. ARTICLE 15 COUNTERPARTS This Credit Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one agreement, and any of the parties hereto may execute this Credit Agreement by signing any such counterpart. This Credit Agreement shall be effective when it has been executed by the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Agent and the Lenders and the Administrative Agent has either received such executed counterparts or has been notified, by telecopy, that such party has executed its counterparts. Delivery of an executed counterpart by facsimile shall be effective as an original executed counterpart and shall be deemed a representation that an original executed counterpart will be delivered. ARTICLE 16 PATRIOT ACT NOTICE Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "Act"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each borrower, guarantor or grantor (the "Loan Parties"), which information includes the name and address of each Loan Party and other information that will allow such Lender to identify such Loan Party in accordance with the Act. 83

Whirlpool Additional information: - --------------------------------- This document contains forward-looking statements that speak only as of this date. Whirlpool disclaims any obligation to update these statements. Forward-looking statements in this document include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expected earnings per share, cash flow, and material and oil-related costs for the full year 2005, as well as expectations as to the closing of the proposed merger with Maytag Corporation. Many risks and
uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from Whirlpool's forward-looking statements. Among these factors are: (1) intense competition in the home appliance industry reflecting the impact of both new and established global, including Asian and European, manufacturers and the strength of trade customers; (2) Whirlpool's ability to continue its strong relationship with Sears Holding Corporation in North America (accounting for approximately 17% of Whirlpool's 2004 consolidated net sales of $13 billion) and other significant trade customers, and the ability of these trade customers to maintain or increase market share; (3) the impact of general economic factors on demand for Whirlpool's products, such as gross domestic product, consumer interest rates, consumer confidence, retail trends, housing starts, sale of existing homes, and the level of mortgage refinancing; (4) the ability of Whirlpool to achieve its business plans, including productivity improvements, cost control, leveraging of its global operating platform and acceleration of the rate of innovation; (5) fluctuations in the cost of key materials (including steel, oil, plastic resins, copper and zinc) and components and the ability of Whirlpool to offset cost increases; (6) the ability of suppliers of critical parts, components and manufacturing equipment to deliver sufficient quantities to Whirlpool in a timely and cost-effective manner; (7) changes in market conditions, health care cost trends and pending regulation that could increase future funding obligations for pension and post-retirement benefit plans; (8) the cost of compliance with environmental and health and safety regulation, including new regulations in Europe regarding appliance disposal; (9) potential exposure to product liability claims, including the outcome of Whirlpool's previously-announced investigation of a supplier-related quality and potential product safety problem that may affect up to 3.5 million appliances manufactured between 2000 and 2002; (10) the impact of labor relations; (11) Whirlpool's ability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights; (12) the ability of Whirlpool to manage foreign currency and its effective tax rate; (13) global, political and/or economic uncertainty and disruptions, especially in Whirlpool's significant geographic markets, including uncertainty and disruptions arising from natural disasters, including possible effects of recent U.S. hurricanes, or terrorist activities; and (14) risks associated with operations outside the U.S. Other such factors relate to Whirlpool's pending merger with Maytag Corporation, including (1) the ability of Whirlpool and Maytag to satisfy the conditions to closing (including Maytag shareholder approval and regulatory approval) and timing of the process; (2) the effect on Maytag's business of the pending transaction; and (3) in the event the merger is completed, Whirlpool's ability to integrate the business of Maytag on a timely basis and realize the full anticipated benefits of the merger within the current estimate of costs.
