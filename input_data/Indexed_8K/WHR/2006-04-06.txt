Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets. On March 31, 2006, Whirlpool Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Whirlpool"), completed its acquisition of Maytag Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Maytag"). Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 22, 2005 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among Whirlpool, Whirlpool Acquisition Co. ("Whirlpool Acquisition") and Maytag, Whirlpool Acquisition merged with and into Maytag (the "Merger"), as a result of which Maytag became a wholly owned subsidiary of Whirlpool. The Merger Agreement is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 2.1 to this Report. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of Maytag common stock outstanding at the effective time of the Merger was converted into the right to receive (i) 0.1196 of a share of Whirlpool common stock, and (ii) $10.50 in cash. The aggregate consideration paid to former Maytag shareholders consisted of approximately 9.6 million shares of Whirlpool common stock and approximately $848 million in cash. Whirlpool obtained the cash portion of the consideration for the Merger through the issuance of commercial paper under commercial paper programs supported by committed bank facilities, as described in Whirlpool's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 (the "2005 10-K"). Whirlpool intends to reissue the commercial paper as it matures from time to time. On March 29, 2006, following Department of Justice clearance of the Merger, borrowing capacity of $500 million under Whirlpool's 364-Day Credit Facility and the remaining $1 billion of borrowing capacity under its Amended and Restated Long-Term Five-Year Credit Agreement became available. The facilities are described in the 2005 10-K and are incorporated by reference as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 to this Report. Item 2.03. Creation of Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant. On March 31, 2006, Maytag retired approximately $185 million aggregate principal amount of Maytag's 6.875% Notes due 2006 (plus accrued interest) upon maturity using available cash of Maytag and Whirlpool and approximately $30 million aggregate principal amount of commercial paper issued by Whirlpool. The information contained in Item 2.01 hereof regarding Whirlpool's issuance of commercial paper to fund the cash portion of the consideration for the Merger is incorporated herein by reference. Whirlpool expects to refinance a portion of its commercial paper borrowings in the capital markets. On April 3, 2006, Whirlpool assumed the obligations for approximately $67 million of the letters of credit issued by Maytag under its credit facility and subsequently Maytag terminated its credit facility. Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits. (a) Financial Statements of Businesses Acquired.
