Exhibit 99.1
 
 
BENTON HARBOR, Mich., April 25, 2006
Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE: WHR) today announced that net earnings increased 37 percent for the first quarter of 2006 to $118 million, or $1.70 per diluted share, compared to $86 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, in the same period last year. The increase reflects strong trade and consumer demand for the company's innovative products around the world. Net sales increased 10 percent to $3.5 billion during the current period and represented a first-quarter record.
 
"Our first-quarter results reflect solid performance by all regional businesses, strong earnings momentum generated from innovation, productivity, and leverage from our global operating platform," said Jeff M. Fettig, Whirlpool's chairman and chief executive officer. "These results reflect the 19th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales improvement and each of our four regional businesses delivered higher operating income during the quarter."
 
Record unit shipments, sales growth and a positive product mix combined with productivity improvements to drive a double-digit improvement in operating profit and offset acquisition related expenses, higher commodity prices, higher new product introduction costs and increased restructuring costs. Results also benefited from a reduced effective tax rate.
 
Results in the quarter do not include Maytag Corporation. Expenses of $13 million associated with the transaction are included within the company's first-quarter operating profit. Maytag's operating results will be included in the company's second-quarter statement of operations.
 
Fettig added: "Industry demand remains positive and we continue to maintain our outlook on the strength of the economic environment despite volatile commodity prices. Our plans, which include accelerating new product innovation to the marketplace, driving total cost productivity, controlling spending by reducing overhead and infrastructure while increasing investments in consumer activities and managing our overall mix of business, remain on track. We remain confident in the underlying operating fundamentals of our business and are pleased with our first-quarter operating and financial performance."
 
During the quarter, cash used in operating activities of $202 million improved $83 million compared to last year, primarily due to lower working capital requirements.

Among these factors are: (1) intense competition in the home appliance industry reflecting the impact of both new and established global, including Asian and European, manufacturers and the strength of trade customers; (2) Whirlpool's ability to continue its strong relationship with Sears Holding Corporation in North America (accounting for approximately 16% of Whirlpool's 2005 consolidated net sales of $14 billion) and other significant trade customers, and the ability of these trade customers to maintain or increase market share; (3) Whirlpool's ability to integrate the recently acquired Maytag Corporation on a timely basis and realize the full anticipated benefits of the merger within the current estimate of costs; (4) demand for Whirlpool's products, including the strength of the U.S. building industry and the level of interest rates; (5) the ability of Whirlpool to achieve its business plans, including productivity improvements, cost control, leveraging of its global operating platform and acceleration of the rate of innovation; (6) fluctuations in the cost of key materials (including steel, oil, plastic resins, copper and zinc) and components and the ability of Whirlpool to offset cost increases; (7) the ability of suppliers of critical parts, components and manufacturing equipment to deliver sufficient quantities to Whirlpool in a timely and cost-effective manner; (8) changes in market conditions, health care cost trends and pending regulation that could increase future funding obligations for pension and post-retirement benefit plans; (9) the cost of compliance with environmental and health and safety regulation, including new regulations in Europe regarding
appliance disposal; (10) potential exposure to product liability claims, including the outcome of Whirlpool's previously-announced investigation of a supplier-related quality and potential product safety problem that may affect up to 3.5 million appliances manufactured between 2000 and 2002; (11) the impact of labor relations; (12) Whirlpool's ability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights; (13) the ability of Whirlpool to manage foreign currency and its effective tax rate; (14) global, political and/or economic uncertainty and disruptions, especially in Whirlpool's significant geographic markets, including uncertainty and disruptions arising from natural disasters; and (15) risks associated with operations outside the U.S. Additional information concerning these factors can be found in Whirlpool's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the annual report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2005.
