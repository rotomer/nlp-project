BENTON HARBOR, Mich., July 25, 2006
Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE: WHR) today announced that second quarter net sales rose 33 percent to a record $4.7 billion, reflecting the acquisition of Maytag Corporation and strong consumer demand for the company's innovative products around the world. Excluding the company's recent acquisition, net sales increased approximately 5 percent.
 
Net earnings from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2006 were $100 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, compared to $96 million, or $1.42 per diluted share in the same period last year. Second quarter net earnings include the results and integration costs of the company's recent acquisition of Maytag.
 
During the second quarter, the company announced its intention to sell the Hoover floor-care, Dixie Narco vending systems, Amana commercial microwave and Jade commercial products appliance businesses. The financial results from these businesses are included in discontinued operations. Total net earnings for the second quarter, including discontinued operations, were $91 million or $1.14 per diluted share.
 
"We are pleased with our second quarter financial results, as well as the rapid progress made in integrating the Maytag business," said Jeff M. Fettig, Whirlpool's chairman and chief executive officer. "All of our regional businesses delivered higher unit volume, sales and operating profit performance during the quarter. I am particularly pleased with the trade and consumer response to our new product innovations, which have been exceptional. We expect material and oil-related cost increases to continue to accelerate during the second-half of 2006. Accordingly, the company is implementing cost-based price adjustments, productivity initiatives and cost controls to offset the heightened cost environment. Our Maytag integration activities are progressing at an efficient and disciplined pace and remain on-track with previous expectations."
 
Operating profit results, which reflect strong sales growth and productivity improvements, offset purchase accounting charges, acquisition integration related expenses, higher commodity prices, new product introduction costs and increased restructuring costs.
 
 
Fettig added: "Global industry growth for the second quarter was in-line with our expectations and consistent with our prior guidance. As previously communicated, we  expect flat-to-moderate industry unit shipment growth during the second half of the year and anticipate global industry growth of 1-to-2 percent in 2007. We continue to successfully introduce a cadence of new product innovation to the marketplace, aggressively invest in our future innovation pipeline, execute plans to drive continuous cost productivity, and implement actions to respond to the current material cost environment. Despite somewhat softer near-term demand, the underlying industry fundamentals remain positive."
 
During the quarter, cash provided by continuing operations of $81 million improved $190 million compared to last year, primarily due to improvements in working capital. Results also reflect the Maytag brand operations and include $44 million of cash outflow related to acquisition integration costs.

Revenue of $3.3 billion increased approximately 50 percent compared to last year, reflecting the acquisition of Maytag, continued strong consumer preference for the company's innovative product offering and increasing demand for new product innovations. Excluding acquisition effect, sales increased approximately 5 percent. For the quarter, the company's U.S. unit shipments of major appliances (T7)* exceeded industry levels, which were up slightly.
Whirlpool North America
 
Operating profit of $192 million for the quarter included purchase accounting charges, acquisition integration expenses, planned new product launch costs and higher material prices. The cost increases were mitigated by strong demand and productivity improvements.

Revenueincreased approximately 5 percentfrom last year's levels to a record $806 million, driven by strong Whirlpool brand performance. Currency translations did not have a material impact on sales.

Whirlpool Europe
 
Strong sales performance, continued improvements in productivity and reductions in administrative costs led to a double-digit improvement in operating profit of 21 percent and a record second quarter operating profit of $45 million.

Outlook
 
"We continue to make excellent progress toward the integration of our Maytag business and remain confident in our ability to realize the value creating opportunities of this  combination," said Fettig.
 
Fettig continued: "The year is progressing as previously expected and we are pleased with our first half-year performance. We receive positive feedback from consumers and trade customers every day validating the strength of our product innovation portfolio and continue to accelerate the advancement of innovation as a core competency throughout the company. We have been addressing the heightened material and oil-related cost environment by driving total cost productivity, implementing cost-based price adjustments, controlling spending by reducing overhead and infrastructure while increasing investments in consumer activities and managing our overall mix of business. These actions are driving success in the current economic environment."
 
"Based on our current assessment, we continue to expect full-year 2006 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $6.00 to $6.25 and free cash flow to be in the $200-to-$300 million range. The company also continues to expect 2007 full-year earnings per diluted share to be approximately $9.00," added Fettig.
 
 
Cash Flow Reconciliation
 
The table below reconciles projected 2006 cash provided by continuing operations determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States to free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure.  Management believes that free cash flow provides shareholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing the company's ability to fund its activities and obligations.  There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures, including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similarly named non-GAAP measures whose calculations may differ from the company's calculations.  As defined by the company, free cash flow is cash provided by continuing operations after capital expenditures and proceeds from the sale of assets.  Free cash flow does not include potential proceeds from the sale of discontinued businesses.  The projections shown here are based upon many estimates and are inherently subject to change based on future decisions made by management and the board of directors of the company and significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies.
