On October 30, 2008, Whirlpool Corporation ("Whirlpool") initiated borrowing $800 million under its Amended and Restated Long Term Five-Year Credit Agreement dated December 2, 2005 ("Amended and Restated Credit Agreement"). Because of continuing uncertainty concerning access to the commercial paper market, Whirlpool has decided to exit the commercial paper market at this time. The funds will be used to repay maturing commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. This is a revolving credit facility and amounts may be borrowed and repaid from time to time. This borrowing bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.35%. After giving effect to this borrowing, Whirlpool has an additional $1.4 billion available for borrowing under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, a portion of which it may borrow from time to time in the foreseeable future.
A description of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and a complete copy thereof, is included in Whirlpool's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 6, 2005, and incorporated by reference herein.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
