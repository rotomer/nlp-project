On February 27, 2009, Whirlpool Corporation (the "Company") entered into Amendment No. 1 (the "Amendment") to the Amended and Restated Long-Term Five-Year Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), dated as of December 1, 2005, by and among the Company, certain other borrowers, the lenders referred to therein, Citibank N.A., administrative agent and fronting agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, and ABN Amro Bank N.V., Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of America, as documentation agents. The Amendment was effective immediately.
The Amendment amends the $2.2 billion Credit Agreement to (1) increase the Company's maximum Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to 3.5 to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, reverting to 3.0 to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter ended thereafter; (2) reduce the Company's minimum Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to 1.5 to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, reverting to 2.0 to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter ended thereafter; (3) limit the value of the assets subject to non-permitted liens to an amount equal to $200,000,000, and permit liens on assets located outside of the United States arising by operation of law; (4) exclude an amount of non-recurring cash restructuring charges of up to $100,000,000 on a rolling 12 month basis for the purposes of calculating "Consolidated EBIT" and "Consolidated EBITDA" under the Credit Agreement; (5) for purposes of calculating the "Leverage Ratio," provide for a $200,000,000 exclusion from the definition of "Indebtedness" for net assets or liabilities with respect to hedging contracts; and (6) increase the spread over LIBOR to 3%, the spread over prime to 2%, and the utilization fee to be paid, if amounts borrowed exceed $1.1 billion, to 1% of the outstanding loans, each as of the date hereof; and (7) replace the facility fee with an unused commitment fee of 0.50%, as of the date hereof. The Company expects to pay the agents and lenders under the Credit Agreement an amendment fee of 0.25% of the commitments or approximately $5,500,000 during the first quarter of 2009. A copy of the Amendment will be filed with the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for its quarter ended March 31, 2009.
For the full-year 2009, the Company continues to expect earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.00 to $4.00, and free cash flow for the year to be from $300 million to $400 million.
