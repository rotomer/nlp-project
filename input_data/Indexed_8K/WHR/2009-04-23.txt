Any of the voting powers, designations, preferences, rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions of any such series may be made dependent upon facts ascertainable outside this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any amendment thereto or outside the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of each such series of Preferred Stock adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, provided that the manner in which such facts shall operate upon the voting powers, designations, preferences, rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions of each such series of Preferred Stock is clearly and expressly set forth in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of each such series of Preferred Stock adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Authority to adopt such resolution or resolutions stating and expressing any or all of the foregoing is hereby expressly vested in the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
In particular and without limitation of the foregoing, the Board of Directors may establish, designate and fix the following with respect to each such series of Preferred Stock: the voting rights, if any, of the stock of each such series which may, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, include (i) the right to more or less than one vote per share on any or all matters voted upon by the stockholders, (ii) the right to vote, as a series by itself or together with other series of Preferred Stock or together with all series of the Preferred Stock as it class, upon such matters, under such circumstances and upon such conditions as the Board of Directors may fix, including, without limitation, the right, voting as a series by itself or together with other series of Preferred Stock or together with all series of Preferred Stock as a class, to elect one or more directors of the Corporation, and (iii) the right to vote cumulatively, as a series by itself or together with other series of Preferred Stock or together with all series of Preferred Stock as a class in any election of directors of the Corporation; the dividend rights, if any, of holders of stock of each such series; the terms on which stock of each

The holders of Common Stock, subject to the provisions of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation and to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, shall have and possess all of the rights appertaining to capital stock of the Corporation.
No holder of Common Stock of the Corporation shall be entitled as such to any preemptive right to subscribe for, purchase or receive any part of the shares of stock of the Corporation at any time held in its treasury or of any unissued shares of any class of stock of the Corporation, either authorized at present or which may at any time hereafter be authorized, or of any issue of notes, bonds or debentures, whether or not convertible into any class of stock of the Corporation, or of any issue of warrants, options or rights to subscribe for shares of any class of stock of the Corporation.
FIFTH: (a) Subject to the rights of holders of Preferred Stock, the number of directors of the Corporation shall be determined from time to time by, or in the manner provided in, the By-Laws of the Corporation. Commencing at the annual meeting of stockholders that is held in calendar year 2010 (the "2010 Annual Meeting"), directors shall be elected annually for terms of one year, except that any director in office at the 2010 Annual Meeting whose term expires at the annual meeting of stockholders held in calendar year 2011 or calendar year 2012 (a "Continuing Classified Director") shall continue to hold office until the end of the term for which such director was elected and until such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified. Accordingly, at the 2010 Annual Meeting, the successors of the directors whose terms expire at that meeting shall be elected for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders that is held in calendar year 2011 and until such directors' successors shall have been elected and qualified. At the annual meeting of stockholders that is held in calendar year 2011, the successors of the directors whose terms expire at that meeting shall be elected for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders that is held in calendar year 2012 and until such directors' successors shall have been elected and qualified. At each annual meeting of stockholders thereafter, all directors shall be elected for terms expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders and until such directors' successors shall have been elected and qualified. Any vacancy in the Board of Directors or newly created directorship resulting from any increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum.
(b) Directors elected prior to the 2010 Annual Meeting and any director appointed to fill a vacancy of any director elected prior to the 2010 Annual Meeting, may be removed from office only for cause. Any other director may be removed from office with or without cause.
(c) Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the election of directors shall be given in the manner provided in the By-Laws.
SIXTH: (a) A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.
If the Delaware General Corporation Law hereafter is amended to further eliminate or limit the liability of a director, then a director of the Corporation, in addition to the circumstances in which a director is not personally liable as set forth in the preceding paragraph, shall not be liable to the fullest extent permitted by the amended Delaware General Corporation Law.
Any repeal or modification of the foregoing two paragraphs by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.
(b)(1) Each individual who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that such individual, or an individual of whom such individual is the legal representative, (i) is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, (ii) is or was serving (at such time as such individual is or was a director or officer of the Corporation) at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, administrator, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans or (iii) is or was serving (at such time as such individual is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation) at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee or administrator of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, partner, trustee, administrator, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, partner, trustee, administrator, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, partner, trustee, administrator, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of such indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) hereof with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
The right to indemnification conferred in this Section shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter "advances"); provided, however, that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by an indemnitee in such indemnitee's capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all advances if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section or otherwise. The Corporation may, by action of its Board of Directors or by action of any person to whom the Board of Directors has delegated such authority, provide indemnification to other employees and agents of the Corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification.
(b)(2) If a claim under paragraph (b)(1) of this Section is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover advances, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such claim. In any action brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right hereunder (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any, has been tendered to the Corporation) it shall be a defense that, and in any action brought by the Corporation to recover advances the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such advances if, the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to an action brought by the indemnitee or create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any action brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right hereunder or by the Corporation to recover payments by the Corporation of advances, the burden of proof shall be on the Corporation.
(b)(3) The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Article shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, By-Law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
(b)(4) The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.
 
SEVENTH: The following provisions are inserted for the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation and to create, define, limit and regulate the powers of the Corporation, the directors and the stockholders:
(a) The Board of Directors shall have power to adopt, amend, alter and repeal the By-Laws of the Corporation.
(b) The presence at any stockholders' meeting, in person or by proxy, of stockholders of the Corporation representing at least 50% of the voting power of the then outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereat shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the purpose of transacting business, except as otherwise provided by statute, but a smaller number may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall be obtained.
(c) The Board of Directors may from time to time determine whether and to what extent and at what times and places and under what conditions and regulations the books and records of the Corporation or any of them shall be open to the inspection of the stockholders, and no stockholder shall have any right to inspect any document, book or record of the Corporation, except as conferred by statute, unless authorized by resolution of the Board of Directors.
(d) Any contract, transaction or act of the Corporation or of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof, or of any officer of the Corporation, which shall be ratified at any annual meeting of stockholders, or at any special meeting thereof called for such purpose, by the holders of a majority of the voting power of the then outstanding stock entitled to vote thereon, shall be as valid and as binding as though ratified by every stockholder of the Corporation.
(e) Any action required or permitted, to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be taken at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders' of the Corporation and the power of stockholders to consent in writing, without a meeting, to the taking of any such action is specifically denied.
EIGHTH: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between this Corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between this Corporation and its stockholders, or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application in a summary way of this Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof, or on the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for this Corporation under the provisions of Section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed for this Corporation under the provisions of Section 279 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of this Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of this Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of this Corporation as a consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization shall, if sanctioned
by the court to which the said application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of stockholders, of this Corporation, as the case may be, and also on this Corporation.
NINTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, or repeal any of the provisions contained in its Restated Certificate of Incorporation in the manner now or hereafter set forth in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation and as prescribed by statute, and all rights and powers conferred on officers, directors and stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

(b) .
Other Participants
(i) Individual awards for Other Participants shall be based on (i) the Other Participant's Target Award and (ii) Corporate and/or Noncorporate performance. In addition, individual performance will be a component of individual awards if approved by the Committee. For each Plan Year, the Chief Executive Officer shall recommend for Other Participants, subject to the approval of the Committee, the Target Award Percentages and performance goals for that Plan Year. Target Award Percentages shall reflect the Participant's job responsibilities and opportunity and authority to affect overall financial results. An Other Participant whose Target Award is changed during the Plan Year shall receive a Final Award based on the amount of Base Salary actually earned while in each Target Award category during the Plan Year.
(ii) Performance for Other Participants shall be measured based on Corporate and/or Noncorporate (if appropriate) results and, if authorized by the Committee, individual performance. If authorized by the Committee, individual performance goals shall be set during the Company's Performance Management Process. The Chief Executive Officer shall recommend, subject to the approval of the Committee, the process for measuring Corporate and Noncorporate performance. Such recommendation shall include:
(1) Organizational level of performance measurement, e.g., Corporate, business unit, division, product line, or another level, either singly or in combination;
(2) Specific measures of performance for each organizational level; and
(3) Specific performance goals for each organizational level.
For each Plan year, the Chief Executive Officer shall recommend, subject to the approval of the Committee, a range of performance goals for Corporate and/or Noncorporate results and the Individual Performance Factors. Each performance range and the range of
 
Individual Performance Factors shall include a level of performance at which 100% of the Target Award shall be earned. In addition, each range shall include levels of performance above and below the 100% performance level.
(iii) For Other Participants at the Corporate level, performance shall, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, be measured on overall Company results. For all other Other Participants, performance shall, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, be measured on Corporate and/or applicable Noncorporate results as authorized by the Committee. The performance measures to be used for Other Participants shall be chosen from among the Covered Employee Performance Measures or any other operational, financial or other performance metric selected by the Committee. Performance measures need not be the same within the Company. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may select among the performance measures from Plan Year to Plan Year.
(iv) Once established, performance goals applicable to Other Participants normally shall not be changed during the Plan Year. However, if the Chief Executive Officer determines that external changes or other unanticipated business conditions have materially affected the fairness of the goals, then the Chief Executive Officer may recommend and the Committee may approve appropriate adjustments to the performance goals applicable to Other Participants (either up or down) during the Plan Year.
(v) Normally, Other Participants shall not receive any payout when the applicable performance goals are not achieved. If the applicable performance goals are not achieved, the Chief Executive Officer may recommend, subject to the approval of the Committee, payment of awards on a discretionary basis to Other Participants. Further, the Chief Executive Officer may recommend, subject to the approval of the Committee, an adjustment of the performance goals applicable to Other Participants in the event of a Plan Year consisting of less than 12 months.
(vi)Individual performance shall be reflected in the Final Award based on the performance rating assigned to an Other Participant as part of the Performance Management Process if the Committee establishes individual performance as part of the performance criteria for an award.
4.2 FINAL AWARD DETERMINATIONS:
(a) . The Committee may establish a formula to determine the Final Award to be payable to the Covered Employee Participant provided that the Covered Employee Performance Goals are met, which formula may, but is not required to, consist of Base Salary multiplied by Individual Performance factor multiplied by Results Factor multiplied by Target Award Percentage. In determining a Covered Employee Participant's Final Award, the Committee shall have the sole and absolute discretion to reduce (including a reduction to zero) the amount of the Maximum Award. The Committee's exercise of negative discretion to reduce the Maximum Award of one Covered Employee Participant
Covered Employee Participants
 
shall not have the effect of increasing the Final Award payable to any other Covered Employee Participant. For the sake of clarity, in no event shall a Covered Employee Participant's Final Award exceed the Covered Employee Participant's Maximum Award.
(b) . At the end of each Plan Year, Final Awards shall be computed for each Other Participant. The Committee retains the discretion to decrease or eliminate the amount of the Final Award otherwise payable to an Other Participant.
Other Participants
(c) . Participants must be actively employed by the Company on the last day of the Plan Year to receive an award for that Plan Year, except as provided in Sections 6.1, 6.2, and 7.1.
All Participants
4.3 DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY:
The Committee may, in its discretion, delegate to the Chief Executive Officer and/or the Vice President Global Human Resources, the authority to take any actions with respect to individual awards for Other Participants that may be taken by the Committee pursuant to the Plan.
5.1 TIMING AND FORM OF PAYMENT:
(a) At the end of each Plan Year, the Chief Executive Officer shall report the level of achievement of the applicable performance goals for Participants to the Committee. Prior to any payment hereunder, the Committee shall certify in writing the extent to which the Covered Employee Performance Measures for Covered Employee Participants and performance measures for Other Participants have been satisfied and approve the payment of Final Awards. With respect to Covered Employee Participants only, the Committee may not waive the achievement of the applicable Covered Employee Participant Goals, except upon the occurrence of an event as specified in Section 7.1 and to the extent specified therein.
(b) Payments of Final Awards to Participants shall be made in cash in a lump sum on March 14th of the calendar year following the applicable Plan Year, provided no Participant shall be entitled to damages with respect to Final Awards paid after March 14th of any calendar year.
(c) Payment of Final Awards may be delayed to a date after the designated payment date specified in Section 5.1(b) under the circumstances described in this Section 5.1(c), provided the Company treats all payments to similarly situated Participants on a reasonably consistent basis.
(i) . A payment to a Covered Employee Participant may be delayed to the extent the Company reasonably anticipates that if the payment were made as scheduled, the Company's deduction with
Payments Subject to Code Section 162(m)
 
respect to such payment would not be permitted due to the applicability of Code Section 162(m), provided that the payment is made either during the Covered Employee Participant's first taxable year in which the Company reasonably anticipates, or should reasonably anticipate, that if the payment is made during such year, the deduction of such payment will not be barred by the applicability of Code Section 162(m) or during the period beginning with the date of the Covered Employee Participant's "separation from service" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A) and ending on the later of the last day of the taxable year of the Company in which the Covered Employee Participant separates from service or the 15th day of the third month following the Covered Participant's "separation from service," and provided further that all scheduled payments to that Covered Employee Participant that could be delayed in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(7)(i) are also delayed. Where the payment is delayed to a date on or after the Covered Employee Participant's "separation from service," the payment will be considered a payment upon a "separation from service" for purposes of the rules under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(2) (payments to specified employees upon a "separation from service") and, in the case of a specified employee (within the meaning of Code Section 409A), the date that is six months after the Covered Employee Participant's "separation from service" is substituted for any reference to the Participant's "separation from service" in the first sentence of this Section 5.1(c)(i). No election may be provided to the Covered Employee Participant with respect to the timing of payment under this Section 5.1(c)(i).
(ii) . A payment may be delayed where the Company reasonably anticipates that the making of the payment will violate Federal securities laws or other applicable law; provided that the payment is made at the earliest date at which the Company reasonably anticipates that the making of the payment will not cause such violation. For this purpose, the making of a payment that would cause inclusion in gross income or the application of any penalty provision or other provision of the Code is not treated as a violation of applicable law.
Payments that would Violate Federal Securities Laws or Other Applicable Law
(iii) . The Company may delay a payment upon such other events and conditions as the Commissioner may prescribe in generally applicable guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
Other Events and Conditions
5.2 DEFERRAL OF PAYMENTS:
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.1 describing the form and timing of payment of Final Awards granted pursuant to the Plan, a Participant who is eligible for and has elected to make deferrals of compensation under the terms of the Whirlpool Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan II may defer payment of all or part of a Final Award granted pursuant to the Plan provided that the time and form of the election to defer and the payment of any portion of the Final Award so deferred shall be governed by the terms of the Whirlpool Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan II.
 
5.3 APPLICATION OF CODE SECTION 409A:
Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, if it is determined that any payment hereunder constitutes "nonqualified deferred compensation" that would be paid upon the "separation from service" of a "specified employee" (as such terms are defined in Code Section 409A), then any such payment that otherwise would have been paid within six months after the Participant's "separation from service" shall be accrued, without interest, and its payment delayed until the first day of the seventh month following the Participant's "separation from service," or if earlier, the Participant's death, at which point the accrued amount will be paid as a single, lump sum cash payment.
6.1 COVERED EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANTS:
(a) If a Covered Employee Participant's employment is terminated by reason of death, or Disability during the Plan Year, the Committee may approve a Final Award for the Covered Employee Participant for the Plan Year. The Final Award shall be paid in accordance with Article V.
(b) Except for terminations listed in Section 6.1(a) or in connection with a termination due to a Change in Control as defined in Section 7.1, in the event a Covered Employee Participant's employment is terminated for any other reason including voluntary and involuntary termination, the Committee may award all or part of such Covered Employee Participant's Maximum Award, if the Covered Employee Performance Goal(s) with respect to such award are otherwise met at the completion of the Plan Year in which such termination of employment occurred.
6.2 OTHER PARTICIPANTS:
(a) If an Other Participant's employment is terminated by reason of death, Disability (as defined in the Whirlpool Employees Pension Plan), retirement, reduction-in-force, or an Other Participant is transferred to an affiliate that does not participate in the Plan, the Other Participant's Final Award shall be based on (i) the Other Participant's actual Base Salary paid through the date of termination, (ii) the Other Participant's Target Award Percentage, (iii) Corporate/Noncorporate performance as measured at the end of the Plan Year, and (iv) if authorized by the Committee, individual performance as determined under the Performance Management Process. The Final Award shall be paid in accordance with Article V.
(b) "Retirement" shall mean a Participant's termination of employment after his or her "Early Retirement Age" or "Normal Retirement Age" as set forth in the Part II Supplement to the Whirlpool Employees Pension Plan for the Salaried Employees Participating Group. "Reduction-in-force" shall have the meaning as defined in the Whirlpool Corporation Personnel Policy Manual.
 
(c) Except for terminations listed in Section 6.2(a) or a termination due to a Change in Control as defined in Section 7.1, in the event an Other Participant's employment is terminated for any other reason including voluntary and involuntary termination, the Other Participant shall not be entitled to an award for the Plan Year in which the termination occurs. However, the Chief Executive Officer may recommend and the Committee approve an award for the Plan Year in which an Other Participant's termination occurs.
6.3 BONUS CLAWBACK:
Any Participant who would otherwise be eligible for an award pursuant to a completed Plan Year shall not be entitled to any payment under that award, and shall be required to repay the Company any payment of such award, if (i) the Participant is terminated by or otherwise leaves employment with the Company within two years following completion of the Plan Year and such termination of employment arises out, is due to, or is in any way connected with any misconduct or violation of Company policy, (ii) the Participant becomes employed with a competitor within the two year period following termination, or for any other reason considered by the Committee in its sole discretion to be detrimental to the Company or its interests.
7.1 CHANGE IN CONTROL:

or
(2) The Participant's Target Award Percentage times his actual Base Salary rate in effect on the date of the Change in Control.
(b) The Committee as constituted immediately prior to the Change in Control shall determine how actual Corporate and Noncorporate performance should be measured for
 
purposes of determining the Results Factor in the Final Award calculation in Section 7.1(a). The Committee's determination shall be conclusive and final.
(c) Final Awards shall be paid in cash to the Participant as soon as administratively possible but no later than 30 days following a Change in Control.
7.2 DEFINITION OF CHANGE IN CONTROL:
A "Change in Control" shall be defined as set forth in the Whirlpool Employees Pension Plan, as amended, provided that to the extent any payment under Section 7.1 is a payment of deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall only occur if the event giving rise to the change in control would also constitute a "change in control event" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.
