Item 8.01 Other Events.
As previously disclosed, government authorities in various jurisdictions are conducting antitrust investigations of the global compressor industry, including our compressor business headquartered in Brazil. On December 18, 2009, a court in Brazil suspended a related criminal proceeding as to certain employees at the request of the public prosecutor. If those individuals comply with certain conditions imposed by the court, including payment to a government fund, a charitable donation, and periodic reporting to authorities, the proceedings against them would be dismissed after three years. Suspension and dismissal of the proceeding does not involve any admission or finding of wrongdoing. Among those subject to the suspension and possible dismissal of proceeding is Paulo Periquito, President, Whirlpool International.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
