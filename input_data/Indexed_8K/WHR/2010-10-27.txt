 Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE: WHR) announced today third-quarter net earnings of $79 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, compared to $87 million, or $1.15 per diluted share reported during the same period last year. Third-quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share
BENTON HARBOR, Mich., October 27, 2010
1
totaled $2.22 compared to $1.67 in the prior year. Sales of $4.5 billion increased 0.5 percent from the third quarter of 2009.
Third-quarter operating profit totaled $234 million compared with $189 million in the prior year. Results were favorably impacted by cost reduction and productivity initiatives and increased monetization of certain tax credits. These favorable factors were partially offset by higher material costs and lower product price/mix. Third-quarter adjusted operating profit
2
totaled $234 million compared to $193 million in the prior year.
"As expected, we faced a challenging environment during the quarter which resulted in a significant slowing in sales growth compared to the first half of the year," said Jeff M. Fettig, chairman and chief executive officer of Whirlpool Corporation. "Our ongoing focus on cost reductions, productivity and innovative new product launches continues to enable us to adapt to changes in the macroeconomic environment."
During the nine months ended September 30, 2010, the company reported cash flow from operations of $377 million. On a year-to-date basis, Whirlpool Corporation generated free cash flow
3
of $(1) million compared with $373 million in the prior year.
 
 
THIRD-QUARTER REGIONAL REVIEW
Whirlpool North America
Third-quarter sales of $2.4 billion decreased 3 percent from the prior year. North America unit shipments increased approximately 1 percent. U.S. industry unit shipments of major appliances (T7)
4
decreased 3 percent during the third quarter.
Third-quarter 2010 adjusted operating profit
2
for the North America region totaled $114 million compared to $147 million in the prior year. Third-quarter results were unfavorably impacted by lower product price/mix and higher material costs. These factors were partially offset by favorable cost reduction and productivity initiatives.
Based on the current economic outlook, the company now expects full-year 2010 U.S. industry unit shipments to increase approximately 3 percent compared to the previous expectation of a 5 percent increase.
Whirlpool Europe
Whirlpool Europe reported third-quarter sales of $827 million, an 8 percent decrease from the prior year. Excluding the effects of currency, sales were approximately equal to the prior year. Overall industry unit demand during the quarter increased approximately 3 to 4 percent compared with the prior year.
The region reported an operating profit of $26 million during the third quarter compared to an operating profit of $14 million in the previous year. The year-over-year improvement was primarily the result of successful cost reduction and productivity initiatives. The improvement was partially offset by lower price/mix and higher material costs.
The company now expects full-year 2010 industry growth in the 1 to 3 percent range compared to the prior expectation of flat demand.
 
 
Whirlpool Latin America
Whirlpool Latin America reported third-quarter net sales of $1.1 billion, an increase of 13 percent from the prior year. Excluding currency translation, sales increased approximately 9 percent.
Operating profit totaled $143 million in the third quarter compared with $93 million in the prior year. The improvement in profitability is primarily related to increased monetization of certain tax credits, cost reductions and productivity initiatives. These factors were partially offset by higher material costs and lower price/mix.
The company continues to anticipate full-year 2010 Brazilian appliance shipments will increase approximately 10 percent.
Whirlpool Asia
Whirlpool Asia reported third-quarter sales of $195 million, increasing 21 percent from the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 16 percent. On an adjusted basis
2
, third quarter operating profit of $5 million was approximately equal to the prior year level. Favorable unit volume levels were offset by higher material and oil-related costs.
The company now expects full-year 2010 industry unit shipments in Asia to increase 8 to10 percent compared to the previous expectation of a 5 to 8 percent increase.
Outlook
For the full-year 2010, Whirlpool Corporation expects reported earnings per diluted share between $7.80 and $8.30. On an adjusted basis, the company's outlook is between $9.56 to $10.06 per share. For the full year, the company continues to expect to generate free cash flow
3
of approximately $550 million to $650 million. The company's earnings and free cash flow projections are based upon current economic forecasts and business plans.
"As we have previously noted, we continue to see a volatile and rapidly changing global economy, which we expect to continue in the near term," said Fettig. "The actions we have put in place have allowed us to offset negative environmental factors and maintain our full-year adjusted earnings outlook."

Forward-looking statements in this document may include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expected earnings per share, cash flow, productivity and material and oil-related prices. Many risks, contingencies and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from Whirlpool's forward-looking statements. Among these factors are: (1) changes in economic conditions which affect demand for our products, including the strength of the building industry and the level of interest rates; (2) the effects of the global economic crisis on our customers, suppliers and the availability of credit; (3) Whirlpool's ability to continue its relationship with significant trade customers, and the ability of these trade customers to maintain or increase market share; (4) intense competition in the home appliance industry reflecting the impact of both new and established global competitors, including Asian and European manufacturers; (5) the ability of Whirlpool to manage foreign currency fluctuations; (6) product liability and product recall costs; (7) litigation and legal compliance risks; (8) the ability of Whirlpool to achieve its business plans, productivity improvements, cost control,

We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted operating profit, adjusted earnings before income taxes and other items (hereafter referred to as "adjusted earnings before tax"), adjusted diluted earnings per share available to Whirlpool common stockholders (hereafter referred to as "adjusted diluted earnings per share"), adjusted operating profit by segment (hereafter referred to as "adjusted segment operating profit"), and free cash flow. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist stockholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes adjusted operating profit, adjusted earnings before tax, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted segment operating profit are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results, and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing the company's ability to fund its activities and obligations. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported operating profit, earnings before income taxes and other items, diluted net earnings per share available to Whirlpool common stockholders and cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the below reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
