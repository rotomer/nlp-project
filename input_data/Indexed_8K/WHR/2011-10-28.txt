WHIRLPOOL CORPORATION REPORTS
THIRD
-QUARTER
2011
RESULTS
Third-Quarter Consolidated Revenue up 2%
EPS of $2.27 Versus $1.02 in Prior-Year Period
Company Announces Major Cost Reduction Initiatives
to Support Margin Expansion and Strengthen Global Competitive Position
BENTON HARBOR, Mich., October 28, 2011
- Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE: WHR) announced today
third
-quarter net earnings of
$177 million
, or
$2.27
per diluted share, compared to net earnings of
$79 million
, or
$1.02
per diluted share reported during the same period last year. On an adjusted basis, excluding non-operating charges, diluted earnings per share
1
totaled $2.35 compared to $2.22 in the prior year. Sales in
2011
were
$4.6 billion
, compared to
$4.5 billion
reported in the
third
quarter of
2010
, a
2 percent
increase driven by favorable currency.
Third
-quarter operating profit totaled
$136 million
compared with
$234 million
in the prior year. Weaker global demand and higher raw material and oil-related costs during the quarter offset the benefits of ongoing productivity, cost reduction initiatives and previously announced price increases.
During the quarter, we experienced weaker than expected global industry demand and elevated material costs, said Jeff M. Fettig, Whirlpool Corporation chairman and chief executive officer. Consumers continue to show strong preference for our unmatched global brand portfolio and new product innovations, and we are beginning to see the benefits from previously announced price increases. However, our results were negatively impacted by recessionary demand levels in developed countries, a slowdown in emerging markets and high levels of inflation in material costs.
1
"As we previously indicated, in a period of uncertain economic growth and consumer demand, we would be prepared to take the necessary actions in order to expand our operating margins and improve our earnings. Given the weakening global economic environment, we are today announcing aggressive plans that will result in substantial cost and capacity reductions. The plans are the result of a comprehensive global review of our operations, products and manufacturing facilities.
These actions are expected to result in $400 million in annual cost savings by the end of 2013. The combination of these plans with announced price increases are expected to accelerate margin growth beginning in 2012. Restructuring expenses totaling approximately $500 million will be incurred over the period beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011 through 2013. The company now anticipates recording restructuring expenses of approximately $160 million in 2011 compared with its previous estimate of $75 million to $100 million.
OUTLOOK
"We are taking necessary actions to address a much more challenging global economic environment," said Fettig. We believe our cost and capacity reduction initiatives, recently announced cost-based price increases and innovative product launches will enable us to expand operating margins and deliver long-term value to shareholders.

Due to weaker than expected industry demand, lower production levels and a weak economic environment, Whirlpool Corporation now sees its outlook for 2011 GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.75 to $5.25 compared with its previous estimate at the low-end of the range of $7.25 to $8.25 per share.
Based on revised earnings expectations and industry outlook, the company now expects to generate free cash flow between $(150) million and $(200) million for the full year compared to its previous estimate of $160 million to $260 million. This guidance includes approximately $350 million of U.S. energy tax credits and $250 million to $300 million of BEFIEX credit monetization. U.S. cash pension contributions are expected to be at approximately $300 million.

appliance industry shipments in the Latin America region to increase in the range of 0 to 5 percent.

Whirlpool disclaims any obligation to update these statements. Forward-looking statements in this document may include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expected earnings per share, cash flow, productivity and material and oil-related prices. Many risks, contingencies and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from Whirlpool's forward-looking statements. Among these factors are: (1) intense competition in the home appliance industry reflecting the impact of both new and established global competitors, including Asian and European manufacturers; (2) Whirlpool's ability to continue its relationship with significant trade customers and the ability of these trade customers to maintain or increase market share; (3) changes in economic conditions which affect demand for our products, including the strength of the building industry and the level of interest rates; (4) litigation and legal compliance risk and costs, especially costs which may be materially different from the amount we expect to incur or have accrued for; (5) the effects and costs of governmental investigations or related actions by third parties; (6) the ability of Whirlpool to achieve its business plans, price increases, productivity improvements, cost control, leveraging of its global operating platform, and acceleration of the rate of innovation; (7) fluctuations in the cost of key materials (including steel, oil, plastic, resins, copper and aluminum) and components and the ability of Whirlpool to offset cost increases; (8) product liability and product recall costs; (9) the ability of Whirlpool to manage foreign currency fluctuations; (10) global, political and/or economic uncertainty and disruptions, especially in Whirlpool's significant geographic regions, including uncertainty and disruptions arising from natural disasters or terrorist attacks; (11) inventory and other asset risk; (12) the ability of suppliers of critical parts, components and manufacturing equipment to deliver sufficient quantities to Whirlpool in a timely and cost-effective manner; (13) health care cost trends, regulatory changes and variations between results and estimates that could increase future funding obligations for pension and post retirement benefit plans; (14) Whirlpool's ability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights; (15) information technology system failures and data security breaches; (16) the impact of labor relations; (17) our ability to attract, develop and retain executives and other qualified employees; and (18) changes in the legal and regulatory environment including environmental and health and safety regulations.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
(Millions of dollars except per share data)
(Unaudited)
We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted operating profit, adjusted earnings before income taxes and other items (hereafter referred to as adjusted earnings before tax), adjusted diluted earnings per share available to Whirlpool common stockholders (hereafter referred to as adjusted diluted earnings per share), adjusted operating profit by segment (hereafter referred to as adjusted segment operating profit), and free cash flow. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist stockholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes adjusted operating profit, adjusted earnings before tax, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted segment operating profit are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results, and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing the company's ability to fund its activities and obligations. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported operating profit, earnings before income taxes and other items, diluted net earnings per share available to Whirlpool common stockholders and cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the below reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
