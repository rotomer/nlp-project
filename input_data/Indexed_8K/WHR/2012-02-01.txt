WHIRLPOOL CORPORATION REPORTS
FOURTH
-QUARTER
AND FULL-YEAR
2011
RESULTS
Fourth-Quarter EPS of
$2.62
Versus
$2.19
in Prior-Year Period
Full-Year 2011 EPS of
$4.99
in Line With Previous Guidance
Significant Profitability Improvement in North America Region
as Company Continues to Focus on Margin Expansion Actions
BENTON HARBOR, Mich., February 1, 2012
- Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE: WHR) announced today
fourth
-quarter net earnings of
$205 million
, or
$2.62
per diluted share, compared to net earnings of
$171 million
, or
$2.19
per diluted share reported during the same period last year.
Fourth
-quarter sales in
2011
were
$4.9 billion
, compared to
$5.0 billion
reported in the
fourth
quarter of
2010
. Improving price/mix was offset by unfavorable currency and lower industry demand.
Fourth-quarter operating profit totaled
$205 million
compared with
$202 million
in the prior year-period. Results were positively impacted by continued improvement in price mix and cost productivity. In particular, the focused actions yielded a substantial improvement in the profitability of the North America region partially offset by weak economic conditions in Europe. Higher raw material costs, lower production to adjust inventories to weak global industry demand, unfavorable currency and lower monetization of Brazilian (BEFIEX) tax credits adversely impacted results during the quarter. Results also included significantly higher restructuring expense and the positive impact from a previously disclosed supplier quality recovery and a benefit plan curtailment gain. Operating profit for the year totaled $792 million compared with $1.0 billion in 2010 largely driven by significantly higher material and oil-related costs.
1
Full-year 2011 sales reached
$18.7 billion
, up
2 percent
from the prior year. Net earnings for the year were
$4.99
per diluted share compared to
$7.97
per diluted share reported for
2010
.
During the fourth quarter, on an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share,
(1)
excluding unusual items, restructuring expense, Brazilian (BEFIEX) tax credits and U.S. energy tax credits,
totaled
$0.32
compared to
$0.43
in the prior year. For the full year, on an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share,
(1)
excluding unusual items, restructuring expense, Brazilian (BEFIEX) tax credits and U.S. energy tax credits, totaled
$2.05
, compared to
$4.47
in the prior year.
As we enter 2012, we are executing strong actions to continue to improve operating margins through our cost and capacity reduction initiatives, ongoing productivity programs and previously announced price increases," said Jeff M. Fettig, Whirlpool Corporation chairman and chief executive officer. "We exit 2011 with improving product price/mix, significantly lower inventory levels and strong new product innovation. These initiatives are the key drivers to improving our operating margins throughout 2012."
During the twelve-months ended December 31, 2011, the company reported cash flow provided by operating activities of
$530 million
, compared to cash flow provided by operating activities of
$1.1 billion
in the prior-year period. Full-year 2011 results include $298 million in pension contributions and $301 million for the first of two payments related to the Brazilian collection dispute settlement. On a year-to-date basis, Whirlpool Corporation reported free cash flow
(2)
of
$(55) million
compared to
$502 million
in the prior-year period.
OUTLOOK
For 2012, Whirlpool Corporation expects to report full-year diluted earnings per share of
$5.00
to
$5.50
. On an adjusted basis (excluding restructuring charges and Brazilian (BEFIEX) tax credits), the company expects to report full-year adjusted diluted earnings
(1)
per share of
$6.50
to
$7.00
.
2
*The U.S. energy tax program concluded at the end of 2011. 2012 outlook does not include energy tax credits.
For the full-year 2012, Whirlpool Corporation expects to generate free cash flow
(2)
between
$100 million
and
$150 million
. Included in this guidance is the $275 million final installment to settle the Brazilian collection dispute, $110 million for antitrust resolutions, pension contributions of approximately $250 million and restructuring cash outlays of $279 million. Strong cash generation from our business is expected to more than offset these legacy liabilities, fund our cost and capacity reduction initiatives and new product innovation.
 
"We are assuming relatively flat to slightly improving industry demand during the year and have planned our business accordingly," said Fettig. "The cadence of strong product innovation, price/mix momentum entering the year, recently announced cost-based price increases, benefits from our cost and capacity reduction initiatives and on-going productivity programs are expected to improve our results in the coming year and show significant progress towards our long-term financial goals. As illustrated by the operating profit improvement we've seen in our North America business, we are beginning to yield a strong improvement in our operating results."

FOURTH
-QUARTER REGIONAL REVIEW
Whirlpool North America
Fourth
-quarter sales of
$2.6 billion
increased
1 percent
from the prior year. Overall, North America unit shipments decreased
approximately
3 percent
, with U.S. industry unit shipments of major appliances (T7)
(3)
also decreasing approximately 3 percent.
The North America region reported operating profit of
$202 million
for the quarter compared to $53 million in the previous year. Current year results include $96 million from a previously disclosed supplier quality recovery and benefit plan curtailment gain. Operating results were favorably impacted by the implementation of previously announced price increases and improved product mix which more than offset lower industry volumes, higher material costs and the impact from lower production volumes.
Based on the current economic outlook, the company expects full-year 2012 U.S. industry unit shipments to increase in the range of 0 to 3 percent.
Whirlpool Europe, Middle East and Africa
Whirlpool Europe, Middle East and Africa reported
fourth
-quarter sales of $848 million, an
8 percent
decrease from the prior year. Unit shipments for the region decreased
4 percent
.
Excluding currency translation, sales decreased approximately 7 percent.
An operating loss totaling
$32 million
in the
fourth
quarter was down from $29 million in operating profit during the prior-year period. Results were adversely affected by the ongoing European financial crisis which led to weak consumer demand across the euro zone, material costs, lower production to adjust to lower industry demand in the region and product price/mix.
The company expects full-year 2012 industry unit shipments to decrease in the range of 2 to 5 percent.
Whirlpool Latin America
Whirlpool Latin America reported
fourth
-quarter sales of
$1.3 billion
, a decrease of
5 percent
from the prior year. Latin America unit shipments were down 4 percent from the prior-year period. Excluding currency translation, sales decreased approximately 1 percent.
4
The region reported operating profit of
$155 million
compared to $193 million in the previous year. Favorable product price/mix was offset by lower monetization of tax credits, higher material costs, unfavorable currency and reduced production levels.
The company expects full-year 2012 appliance industry shipments in the Latin America region to increase in the range of 2 to
5 percent
.
Whirlpool Asia
Whirlpool Asia reported
fourth
-quarter sales of
$200 million
, a decrease of
2 percent
from the prior year. Asia unit shipments remained flat year-over-year. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 4 percent.
Operating profit totaling
$2 million
in the
fourth
quarter was down from $4 million in the prior-year period. Favorable product price/mix was offset by higher material costs and weak consumer demand in India.
The company expects full-year 2012 industry unit shipments in Asia to increase approximately
2
to
4 percent
.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
(Millions of dollars except per share data)
(Unaudited)
We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we refer to as "ongoing business operations" measures, including adjusted operating profit, adjusted earnings (loss) before income taxes and other items (hereafter referred to as adjusted earnings (loss) before tax), adjusted diluted earnings per share available to Whirlpool common stockholders (hereafter referred to as adjusted diluted earnings per share), adjusted operating profit by segment (hereafter referred to as adjusted segment operating profit), and free cash flow. Ongoing business operations measures exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist stockholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes adjusted operating profit, adjusted earnings before tax, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted segment operating profit are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results, and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing the company's ability to fund its activities and obligations. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported operating profit, earnings before income taxes and other items, diluted net earnings per share available to Whirlpool common stockholders and cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the below reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
