FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BENTON HARBOR, Mich., April 17, 2012  Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE: WHR) stated that the U.S. International Trade Commission ("ITC") today found that unlawfully traded bottom-mount refrigerators imported from South Korea and Mexico did not cause material injury to the U.S. industry. The company plans to review the ITC's final decision and will determine whether or not to appeal.
"Of course we're extremely disappointed by today's ruling and the implications it has for our U.S. production of bottom-mount refrigerators," said Marc Bitzer, President, Whirlpool North America. "We believe the facts clearly demonstrated that dumped imports of bottom-mount refrigerators from South Korea and Mexico are causing injury to the U.S. industry. Despite today's ruling, Whirlpool remains committed to taking action against any unlawful trade practices that threaten our 23,000 U.S. employees or our ability to produce in the United States the innovative and high-quality products that consumers demand."
Whirlpool filed anti-dumping and anti-subsidy petitions in March 2011 to establish conditions of fair competition that will support continued investment and innovation in the production of high-end refrigerators in the United States, and the American jobs created by that production. The Whirlpool products affected by this case are made in Amana, Iowa, where the company employs approximately 2,200 people.
As the world's leading home appliance maker, Whirlpool Corporation is a recognized leader in product innovation and quality. Whirlpool products received 10 "Best Buy" designations and were ranked first in five categories in a leading U.S. consumer magazine.
