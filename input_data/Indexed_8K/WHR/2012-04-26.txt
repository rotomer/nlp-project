WHIRLPOOL CORPORATION REPORTS
FIRST
-QUARTER
2012
RESULTS
Margin Expansion Actions Drive Improvement
Despite Weak Appliance Demand
Strong North America and Latin America Performance
First-Quarter GAAP EPS of
$1.17
; Adjusted EPS
(1)
of
$1.41
BENTON HARBOR, Mich., April 26, 2012
- Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE: WHR) announced today
first
-quarter net earnings of
$92 million
, or
$1.17
per diluted share, compared to net earnings of
$169 million
, or
$2.17
per diluted share reported during the same period last year. The primary driver of this year-over-year change in GAAP earnings is lower tax credits of approximately $1.46 per share. On an adjusted basis, excluding unusual items, restructuring expense, Brazilian (BEFIEX) tax credits and U.S. energy tax credits, diluted earnings per share
(1)
totaled
$1.41
compared to
$0.64
in the prior year. Sales in
2012
were
$4.3 billion
, compared to
$4.4 billion
reported in the
first
quarter of
2011
, decreasing
1 percent
driven by weaker appliance demand, unfavorable currency and lower monetization of (BEFIEX) tax credits.
First
-quarter operating profit totaled
$205 million
compared with
$228 million
in the prior year primarily driven by lower industry demand, higher material costs, reduced monetization of Brazilian (BEFIEX) tax credits and increased restructuring expense. On an adjusted basis, first-quarter operating profit
(2)
totaled
$232 million
and was up significantly from the
$163 million
reported in the prior year. Continued improvement in product price/mix, cost and capacity-reduction initiatives and ongoing productivity positively impacted results during the quarter. Strong profitability improvement in the North America and Latin America regions was partially offset by weak economic conditions in Europe.
1
The first quarter was a strong start to the year as we benefited from our margin expansion efforts and continued innovation investments, said Jeff M. Fettig, Whirlpool Corporation chairman and chief executive officer. "Our cost and capacity-reduction initiatives and previously implemented cost-based pricing actions are on track to deliver our operating profit margin, earnings and free cash flow guidance for the year."
During the
three months ended
March 31, 2012
, the company reported cash flow used in operating activities of
$(423) million
compared to cash flow used in operating activities of
$(224) million
in the prior-year period. Current year results include
$275 million
related to the settlement of the Brazilian collection dispute and $58 million in U.S. pension contributions.
OUTLOOK
Whirlpool Corporation continues to expect full-year diluted earnings per share of $5.00 to $5.50 and, on an adjusted basis (excluding restructuring charges and Brazilian (BEFIEX) tax credits), diluted earnings
(1)
per share of $6.50 to $7.00.
*The U.S. energy tax program concluded at the end of 2011. 2012 outlook does not include energy tax credits.
The company continues to expect to generate free cash flow
(3)
between
$100 million
and
$150 million
. Included in this guidance is the $275 million final installment to settle the Brazilian collection dispute, $110 million for antitrust settlements, pension contributions of up to $250 million and restructuring cash outlays of up to $279 million. Strong cash generation from our business is expected to more than offset these legacy liabilities, fund our cost and capacity-reduction initiatives and new product innovation.

FIRST
-QUARTER REGIONAL REVIEW
Whirlpool North America
First
-quarter sales of
$2.2 billion
decreased
1 percent
from the prior year. Overall, North America unit shipments
decrease
d
approximately
7 percent
, with U.S. industry unit shipments of major appliances (T7)
(4)
decreasing approximately 10 percent.
The North America region reported operating profit of
$151 million
compared to
$59 million
in the previous year. On an adjusted basis, operating profit
(5)
of
$151 million
tripled versus the
$52 million
reported in the prior year. Operating results were favorably impacted by the implementation of previously announced cost-based price increases, improved product mix, cost and capacity-reduction efforts, and ongoing productivity which more than offset lower industry volumes and higher material costs.
Based on the current economic outlook, the company now expects full-year 2012 U.S. industry unit shipments to trend to the low end of its previous
0
to
3 percent
range.
Whirlpool Latin America
Whirlpool Latin America reported
first
-quarter sales of
$1.3 billion
, an
increase
of
3 percent
from the prior year. Excluding currency translation, sales
increased
7 percent
. Latin America unit shipments
increase
d
2 percent
.
The region reported operating profit of
$121 million
compared to
$174 million
in the previous year. During the 2012 and 2011 quarters, we monetized
$7 million
and
$66 million
of Brazilian (BEFIEX) tax credits, respectively.
On an adjusted basis, operating profit
(5)
totaled
$114 million
versus
$108 million
in the prior year. Favorable product price/mix and ongoing productivity initiatives were partially offset by unfavorable currency, lower monetization of tax credits and higher material costs.
The company now expects full-year
2012
appliance industry shipments in the Latin America region to
increase
towards the high end of its previous
2
to
5 percent
range.
3
Whirlpool Europe, Middle East and Africa
Whirlpool Europe, Middle East and Africa reported
first
-quarter sales of
$688 million
, an
8 percent
decrease
from the prior year. Excluding currency translation, sales
decreased
approximately
3 percent
. Unit shipments for the region
decrease
d
4 percent
.
Operating profit of
$5 million
improved sequentially from the $32 million fourth quarter loss and was down from
$25 million
in the prior-year period. Favorable product price/mix and cost and capacity-reduction benefits were offset by continued weak consumer demand across the euro zone, lower production to adjust to lower industry demand in the region and higher material costs.
The company continues to expect full-year 2012 industry unit shipments to
decrease
in the range of
2
to
5 percent
.
Whirlpool Asia
Whirlpool Asia reported
first
-quarter sales of
$202 million
, a
decrease
of
3 percent
from the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, sales
increased
2 percent
. Asia unit shipments
increase
d
1 percent
.
Operating profit totaling
$9 million
in the
first
quarter was down from
$11 million
in the prior-year period. Volume growth, favorable product price/mix and ongoing productivity were more than offset by unfavorable currency and higher material costs.
The company now expects full-year
2012
industry unit shipments in Asia to
increase
at the low end of its previous
2
to
4 percent
range.

Forward-looking statements in this document may include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expected earnings per share, cash flow, productivity and material and oil-related prices. Many risks, contingencies and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from Whirlpool's forward-looking statements. Among these factors are: (1) intense competition in the home appliance industry reflecting the impact of both new and established global competitors, including Asian and European manufacturers; (2) Whirlpool's ability to continue its relationship with significant trade customers and the ability of these trade customers to maintain or increase market share; (3) changes in economic conditions which affect demand for our products, including the strength of the building industry and the level of interest rates; (4) inventory and other asset risk; (5) global, political and/or economic uncertainty and disruptions, especially in Whirlpool's significant geographic regions, including uncertainty and disruptions arising from natural disasters or terrorist attacks; (6) The impact of the European debt crisis; (7) the ability of Whirlpool to achieve its business plans, productivity improvements, cost control, price increases, leveraging of its global operating platform, and acceleration of the rate of innovation; (8) fluctuations in the cost of key materials (including steel, oil, plastic, resins, copper and aluminum) and components and the ability of Whirlpool to offset cost increases; (9) litigation and legal compliance risk and costs, especially costs which may be materially different from the amount we expect to incur or have accrued for; (10) product liability and product recall costs; (11) the effects and costs of governmental investigations or related actions by third parties; (12) Whirlpool's ability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights; (13) the ability of suppliers of critical parts, components and manufacturing equipment to deliver sufficient quantities to Whirlpool in a timely and cost-effective manner; (14) health care cost trends, regulatory changes and variations between results and estimates that could increase future funding obligations for pension and post retirement benefit plans; (15) information technology system failures and data security breaches; (16) the impact of labor relations; (17) our ability to attract, develop and retain executives and other qualified employees; (18) changes in the legal and regulatory environment including environmental and health and safety regulations; and (19) the ability of Whirlpool to manage foreign currency fluctuations.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
(Millions of dollars except per share data)
(Unaudited)
We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we refer to as "ongoing business operations" measures, including adjusted operating profit, adjusted earnings (loss) before income taxes (hereafter referred to as adjusted earnings (loss) before tax), adjusted diluted earnings per share available to Whirlpool common stockholders (hereafter referred to as adjusted diluted earnings per share), adjusted operating profit by segment (hereafter referred to as adjusted segment operating profit), and free cash flow. Ongoing business operations measures exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist stockholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes adjusted operating profit, adjusted earnings before tax, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted segment operating profit are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to our core operating results, and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing the company's ability to fund its activities and obligations. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported operating profit, earnings before income taxes, diluted net earnings per share available to Whirlpool common stockholders and cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the following reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
