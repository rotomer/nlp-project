2. .
Appointment of Agents; Solicitation by the Agents of Offers to Purchase; Sales of Notes to a Purchaser
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company hereby authorizes each of the Agents to act as its agent to solicit offers for the purchase of all or part of the Notes from the Company.
On the basis of the representations and warranties, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each of the Agents agrees, as agent of the Company, to use its reasonable efforts to solicit offers to purchase the Notes from the Company upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus (and any supplement thereto) and in the Procedures. Each Agent shall make reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Notes has been solicited by such Agent and accepted by the Company, but such Agent shall not, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, have any liability to the Company in the event any such purchase is not consummated for any reason. Except as provided in Section 2(b), under no circumstances will any Agent be obligated to purchase any Notes for its own account. It is understood and agreed, however, that any Agent may purchase Notes as principal pursuant to Section 2(b).
The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to instruct the Agents to suspend at any time, for any period of time or permanently, the solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes. Upon receipt of instructions from the Company, the Agents will forthwith suspend solicitation of offers to purchase Notes from the Company until such time as the Company has advised them that such solicitation may be resumed.
Subject to the provisions of this Section and to the Procedures, offers for the purchase of Notes may be solicited by an Agent as agent for the Company at such time and in such amounts as such Agent deems advisable. The Company may from time to time offer Notes for sale otherwise than through an Agent and the Company may solicit or accept offers to purchase Notes through any agent other than an Agent.
 
(b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, whenever the Company and any of you determine that the Company shall sell Notes directly to any of you as principal, each such sale of Notes shall be made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and, a supplemental agreement relating to such sale. Each such supplemental agreement is herein referred to as a "Terms Agreement." Each Terms Agreement shall describe the Notes to be purchased by the Purchaser pursuant thereto and shall specify the principal amount of each such Note, the aggregate principal amount of all such Notes, the maturity date of such Notes, the rate at which interest will be paid on such Notes, the dates on which interest will be paid on such Notes and the record date with respect to each such payment of interest, the Closing Date (as defined below) for such Notes, the place of delivery of the Notes and payment therefor, the method of payment and any requirements for the delivery of opinions of counsel, certificates from the Company or its officers or a letter from the Company's registered independent public accountants, as described in Section 6(b). Any such Terms Agreement may also specify the period of time referred to in Section 4(n). Any written Terms Agreement may be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B. The Purchaser's commitment to purchase Notes shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representation and warranties of the Company herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth.
Delivery of the certificates for Notes sold to the Purchaser pursuant to a Terms Agreement shall be made not later than the Closing Date agreed to in such Terms Agreement, against payment of funds to the Company in the net amount due to the Company for such Notes by the method and in the form set forth in the Procedures unless otherwise agreed to between the Company and the Purchaser in such Terms Agreement.
Unless otherwise agreed to between the Company and the Purchaser in a Terms Agreement, any Note sold to a Purchaser (i) shall be purchased by such Purchaser at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof less a percentage equal to the commission applicable to an agency sale of a Note of identical maturity and (ii) may be resold by such Purchaser at varying prices from time to time or, if set forth in the applicable Terms Agreement and Pricing Supplement, at a fixed public offering price. In connection with any resale of Notes purchased, a Purchaser may use a selling or dealer group and may reallow any portion of the discount or commission payable pursuant hereto to dealers or agents.
3. .
Offering and Sale of Notes
(a) Each Agent shall communicate to the Company, orally or in writing, each offer (unless previously rejected by such Agent as provided below) to purchase Notes on terms previously communicated by the Company to such Agent, and the Company shall have the sole right to accept such offers to purchase Notes and may refuse any proposed purchase of Notes in whole or in part for any reason. Each Agent shall have the right, in its discretion reasonably exercised, to reject any such offer received by it in whole or in part. Each Agent and the Company agree to perform the respective duties and obligations specifically provided to be performed by them in the Procedures.
(b) The Agents and the Purchasers covenant with the Company that they shall not use, refer to or distribute any Free Writing Prospectus except:
 
(1) an applicable Free Writing Prospectus that (i) is not an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and (ii) contains only information describing the preliminary terms of the Notes or their offering, which information is limited to the categories of terms referenced in Schedule IV hereto or otherwise permitted under Rule 134 under the Act;
(2) an applicable Free Writing Prospectus as shall be agreed in writing with the Company that is not distributed, used or referenced by the Agents in a manner reasonably designed to lead to its broad unrestricted dissemination unless the Company consents in writing to such dissemination; and
(3) an applicable Free Writing Prospectus identified in a schedule to the applicable Terms Agreement as forming part of the Disclosure Package.
4. . The Company agrees with each of you that:
Agreements
(a) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Notes (including by way of resale by a Purchaser of Notes), the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement to the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (except for (i) periodic or current reports filed under the Exchange Act, (ii) a supplement relating to any offering of, or a change in the maturity dates, interest rates, issuance prices or other similar terms of, any Notes or (iii) a supplement relating to an offering of Securities other than the Notes) unless the Company has furnished each of you a copy for your review prior to filing and given each of you a reasonable opportunity to comment on any such proposed amendment or supplement. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company will cause each supplement to the Prospectus to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to you of such filing. The Company will promptly advise each of you (i) when the Prospectus, and any supplement thereto (except for a supplement relating to an offering of Securities other than the Notes), shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), (ii) when, prior to the termination of the offering of the Notes, any amendment of the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any reasonable proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the suspension of any such qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof;
(b) In connection with any offering of the Notes:
(i) The Company will, before amending or supplementing the Disclosure Package, furnish to the Agents and the Purchasers a copy of each such proposed amendment or supplement and during the period where a prospectus relating to the Notes is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirements may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172) not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which the Agents and the Purchasers reasonably object;
 
(ii) The Company will prepare any Free Writing Prospectus to be included in the Disclosure Package in relation to the Notes in a form which shall be provided to the Agents for their review and comment prior to the Time of Sale.

Conditions to the Obligations of the Agents
(a) If filing of the Prospectus, or any supplement thereto, is required pursuant to Rule 424(b), the Prospectus and any such supplement, shall have been filed in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) and shall have filed with the Commission any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in the manner and within the time periods required by the rules and regulations related to the Act; and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose shall have been instituted or threatened;

(e) The Company shall have furnished to the Agents a certificate of the Company, signed by the chairman of the board, any president or vice president (whether or not designated by a number or word added before or after the title vice president) and the principal
 
financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and this Agreement and, if applicable, the Disclosure Package and that:
(i) the representations and warranties in Section 1 hereof of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date and the Company has substantially complied with all the agreements and substantially satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied as a condition to the obligation of the Agents to solicit offers to purchase the Notes;
(ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and
(iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change in the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, expect as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus;
(f) At the Execution Time, the Company's registered independent public accountants shall have furnished to the Agents a letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to the Agent), dated as of the Execution Time, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agents, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable published rules and regulations thereunder and stating in effect that:
(i) in their opinion the audited financial statements and financial statement schedules included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and reported on by them comply in form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations;
(ii) on the basis of a reading of the amounts included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus in response to Item 301 of Regulation S-K and of the latest unaudited financial statements made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; carrying out certain procedures specified by the Agents (but not an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, directors and executive committees of the Company and its subsidiaries; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to the date of the most recent audited financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that:
 
(1) any unaudited financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus do not comply in form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the Commission with respect to financial statements included or incorporated in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act; and said unaudited financial statements are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus;
(2) with respect to the period subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements (other than any capsule information), audited or unaudited, in or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there were any changes, at a specified date not more than five Business Days prior to the date of the letter, in the aggregate long-term debt due within one year and long-term debt (exclusive of current portion) of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries or common stock of the Company or decreases in the net current assets or shareholders' equity of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as compared with the amounts shown on the most recent consolidated balance sheet included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, or for the period from the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus to the date of the most recently available monthly unaudited financial information there were any decreases relating to income from continuing operations, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in total revenue or earnings before income taxes or in the total or per share amounts of net earnings of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, except in all instances for changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Company as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Agents; or
(3) the amounts included in any unaudited "capsule" information included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus do not agree with the amounts set forth in the unaudited financial statements for the same periods or were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the audited financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus;
(iii) they have performed certain other procedures specified by the Agents as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement, including the information included or incorporated in Items 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 and 11 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and the information included in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included or incorporated in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation; and
 
(iv) if unaudited pro forma financial statements are included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, on the basis of a reading of the unaudited pro forma financial statements, carrying out certain procedures specified by the Agents, inquiries of certain officials of the Company and the acquired company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters, and proving the arithmetic accuracy of the application of the pro forma adjustments to the historical amounts in the pro forma financial statements, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that the pro forma financial statements do not comply in form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of Rule 11-02 of Regulation S-X or that the pro forma adjustments have not been properly applied to the historical amounts in the compilation of such statements;
(g) At the Closing Date, the Agents shall have received from the Company's registered independent public accountants a letter, dated as of Closing Date and in form and substance satisfactory to the Agents, to the effect that they reaffirm the statements made in the letter furnished pursuant to subsection (f) of this Section 5, except that the specified date referred to therein for the carrying out of procedures shall be a date not more than three Business Days prior to Closing Date; and

If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Agents and their counsel, this agreement and all obligations of any Agent hereunder may be canceled at any time by such Agent. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or telegraph confirmed in writing.

Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or telegraph confirmed in writing.

(b) The Company agrees that any person who has agreed to purchase and pay for any Note pursuant to a solicitation by any of the Agents shall have the right to refuse to purchase such note if, subsequent to the agreement to purchase such Note, any change, condition or development specified in any of Sections 9(b)(i) through (vi) shall have occurred (with the judgment of the Purchaser which presented the offer to purchase such Note being substituted for any judgment of an Agent required therein), the effect of which is, in the judgment of the Agent which presented the offer to purchase such Note, so material and adverse as to make it impractical to proceed with the sale and delivery of such Note (it being understood that under no circumstance shall any such Agent have any duty or obligation under this Agreement to the Company or to any such person to exercise the judgment permitted to be exercised under this Section 7(b) and Section 9(b)).
8. .
Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of you, the directors, officers or employees of each of you and each person who controls each of you within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which you, they or any of you or them may become subject under
 
the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Disclosure Package (or any part thereof), the Prospectus or any preliminary Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse as incurred each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any of you specifically for use in connection with the preparation thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have. If the Company shall default in its obligations to deliver Notes to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall indemnify and hold each of you harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default by the Company.
provided
however
(b) Each of you agrees severally and not jointly to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its employees and directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to you, but only with reference to written information relating to such of you furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such of you specifically for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which you may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the names of the Agents and Purchasers set forth in any Pricing Supplement constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of any of you for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity, the proviso contained in paragraph (a) of this Section 8 and clause (ii) of the proviso in paragraph (b) of Section 1, and you confirm that such statements are correct.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability which it may have to any indemnified party. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; , , that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate
provided
however
 
counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel and an additional local counsel, if needed, approved by you in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 8, representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party or (iv) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii). An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is due in accordance with its terms, but is held by a court to be unavailable or insufficient in whole or in part to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and each of you agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively, "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of you may be subject in such proportion so that each of you is responsible for that portion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and each of you from the offering of the Notes from which such Losses arise; , , that in no case shall any of you be responsible for any amount in excess of the commissions received by such of you in connection with the Notes from which such Losses arise (or, in the case of Notes sold pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the aggregate commissions that would have been received by such of you if such commissions had been payable). If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and each of you shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and of each of you in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) of the Notes from which such Losses arise, and benefits received by each of you shall be deemed to be equal to the
provided
however
 
total commissions received by such of you in connection with the Notes from which such Losses arise (or, in the case of Notes sold pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the aggregate commissions that would have been received by such of you if such commissions had been payable). Relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether any alleged untrue statement or omission relates to information provided by the Company or any of you.
