WHIRLPOOL CORPORATION REPORTS
SECOND
-QUARTER
2012
RESULTS
Margin Expansion
Led by North America and Latin America Ongoing Business Operations
Reaffirming Full-Year Guidance
BENTON HARBOR, Mich., July 24, 2012
- Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE: WHR) announced today
second
-quarter GAAP net earnings of
$113 million
, or
$1.43
per diluted share, compared to a net loss of
$(161) million
, or
$(2.10)
per diluted share reported during the same period last year. The year-over-year change in GAAP earnings included lower legacy expenses partially offset by lower tax credits. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share
(1)
almost doubled to
$1.55
compared to
$0.81
in the prior year driven by continued improvement in product price/mix and cost and capacity-reduction initiatives.
Sales, in constant currencies, were up approximately 2 percent. Excluding the impact of both foreign currency and lower Brazilian (BEFIEX) tax credits, net sales
increased
more than 3 percent driven primarily by strong product price/mix. On a reported basis, sales in the quarter were
$4.5 billion
, compared to
$4.7 billion
in
2011
.
Our North America and Latin America businesses continue to perform extremely well and we are pleased with our financial performance through the first half of the year, said Jeff M. Fettig, chairman and chief executive officer of Whirlpool Corporation. Our ongoing business operating performance is well ahead of last year offsetting lower industry demand, volatile foreign currency and material inflation. We remain positive regarding our underlying business performance and are optimistic on recent U.S. housing trends exiting the second quarter.
1
Second
-quarter GAAP operating profit totaled
$195 million
compared with
$223 million
in the prior year primarily driven by positive product price/mix which was more than offset by reduced monetization of Brazilian (BEFIEX) tax credits, higher restructuring expense, unfavorable currency, lower industry demand and higher material costs. On an adjusted basis,
second
-quarter operating profit
(2)
totaled
$223 million
, approximately 5 percent of sales, and was up significantly from the
$158 million
, or approximately 3 percent of sales, reported in the prior year. Continued improvement in product price/mix and cost and capacity-reduction initiatives positively impacted results during the quarter. Strong profitability improvement in the North America and Latin America regions was partially offset by weak economic conditions in Europe.
During the
six months ended
June 30, 2012
, the company reported cash flow used in operating activities of
$(355) million
compared to cash flow used in operating activities of
$(234) million
in the prior-year period. Current year results include a
$275 million
non-recurring settlement for a Brazilian collection dispute, $98 million in U.S. pension contributions and $68 million in restructuring cash.
OUTLOOK
Whirlpool Corporation continues to expect full-year diluted earnings per share of
$5.00
to
$5.50
and ongoing business operations diluted earnings
per share
(1)
of $6.50 to $7.00, both of which assume a full-year effective tax rate of 25 percent.
*The U.S. energy tax program concluded at the end of 2011. 2012 outlook does not include energy tax credits.
The company continues to expect to generate free cash flow
(3)
between
$100 million
and
$150 million
. Included in this guidance is the
$275 million
final installment to settle the Brazilian collection dispute, $110 million for antitrust payments, pension contributions of up to $250 million and restructuring cash outlays of up to $280 million.

"Strong cash generation from our business is expected to more than offset these legacy liabilities, fund our cost and capacity-reduction initiatives and fuel new product innovation," said Fettig. "Our expanding operating margins and the conclusion of payments for legacy liabilities position us well for generating strong cash flow in the second half of the year and into 2013."
SECOND
-QUARTER REGIONAL REVIEW
Whirlpool North America
Second
-quarter sales of
$2.5 billion
increased
4 percent
from the prior year. Overall, North America unit shipments
decrease
d
approximately
2 percent
, with U.S. industry unit shipments of major appliances (T7)
(4)
increasing approximately 1 percent.
The North America region reported operating profit of
$235 million
compared to
$76 million
in the previous year. On an adjusted basis, operating profit
(5)
of
$186 million
, approximately 8 percent of sales, more than doubled versus the
$76 million
, or approximately 3 percent of sales, reported in the prior year. Strong continued margin improvements were driven by product price/mix and cost and capacity-reduction initiatives which more than offset lower production levels and higher material costs.
Based on the current economic outlook, the company now expects full-year 2012 U.S. industry unit shipments to be flat to down 2 percent.
Whirlpool Latin America
Whirlpool Latin America reported
second
-quarter sales of
$1.2 billion
compared to
$1.3 billion
in the prior-year period. Excluding currency translation and Brazilian (BEFIEX) tax credits, sales
increased
more than 8 percent on slightly higher volumes.
The region reported operating profit of
$103 million
compared to
$166 million
in the previous year. During the 2012 and 2011 quarters, the company monetized
$2 million
and
$79 million
of Brazilian (BEFIEX) tax credits, respectively.
On an adjusted basis, operating profit
(5)
totaled
$101 million
, approximately 9 percent of sales, versus
$87 million
, approximately 7 percent of sales, in the prior year. Favorable product price/mix was partially offset by unfavorable currency and lower monetization of Brazilian (BEFIEX) tax credits.

2012
appliance industry shipments in the Latin America region to
increase
in the 5 to 7 percent range.
Whirlpool Europe, Middle East and Africa

second
-quarter sales of
$692 million
versus
$841 million
in the prior year. Excluding currency translation, sales decreased approximately
7 percent
. Unit shipments for the region
decrease
d
7 percent
.
Operating loss of
$(26) million
was down from the
$20 million
operating profit in the prior-year period. Favorable cost and capacity-reduction initiatives were more than offset by unfavorable currency and continued weak consumer demand across the Euro zone which also resulted in lower production across the region.
The company continues to expect full-year 2012 industry unit shipments to
decrease
in the range of 2 to 5 percent.
Whirlpool Asia
Whirlpool Asia reported
second
-quarter sales of
$241 million
versus
$257 million
in the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, sales
increased
6 percent. Asia unit shipments
increase
d
1 percent
.
Operating profit of
$14 million
in the
second
quarter was flat compared to the prior-year period. Favorable product price/mix was offset by unfavorable currency and higher material costs.
The company now expects full-year
2012
industry unit shipments in Asia to be flat to up 2 percent.

Many risks, contingencies and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from Whirlpool's forward-looking statements. Among these factors are: (1) intense competition in the home appliance industry reflecting the impact of both new and established global competitors, including Asian and European manufacturers; (2) Whirlpool's ability to continue its relationship with significant trade customers and the ability of these trade customers to maintain or increase market share; (3) changes in economic conditions which affect demand for our products, including the strength of the building industry and the level of interest rates; (4) inventory and other asset risk; (5) global, political and/or economic uncertainty and disruptions, especially in Whirlpool's significant geographic regions, including uncertainty and disruptions arising from natural disasters or terrorist attacks; (6) The impact of the European debt crisis; (7) the ability of Whirlpool to achieve its business plans, productivity improvements, cost control, price increases, leveraging of its global operating platform, and acceleration of the rate of innovation; (8) fluctuations in the cost of key materials (including steel, oil, plastic, resins, copper and aluminum) and components and the ability of Whirlpool to offset cost increases; (9) litigation and legal compliance risk and costs, especially costs which may be materially different from the amount we expect to incur or have accrued for; (10) product liability and product recall costs; (11) the effects and costs of governmental investigations or related actions by third parties; (12) Whirlpool's ability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights; (13) the ability of suppliers of critical parts, components and manufacturing equipment to deliver sufficient quantities to Whirlpool in a timely and cost-effective manner; (14) health care cost trends, regulatory changes and variations between results and estimates that could increase future funding obligations for pension and post retirement benefit plans; (15) information technology system failures and data security breaches; (16) the impact of labor relations; (17) our ability to attract, develop and retain executives and other qualified employees; (18) changes in the legal and regulatory environment including environmental and health and safety regulations; and (19) the ability of Whirlpool to manage foreign currency fluctuations.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
(Millions of dollars except per share data)
(Unaudited)
We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we refer to as "ongoing business operations" measures, including adjusted operating profit, adjusted earnings (loss) before income taxes (hereafter referred to as adjusted earnings (loss) before tax), adjusted diluted earnings per share available to Whirlpool common stockholders (hereafter referred to as adjusted diluted earnings per share), adjusted operating profit by segment (hereafter referred to as adjusted segment operating profit), and free cash flow. Ongoing business operations measures exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist stockholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes adjusted operating profit, adjusted earnings before tax, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted segment operating profit are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to our core operating results, and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing the company's ability to fund its activities and obligations. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported operating profit, earnings before income taxes, diluted net earnings per share available to Whirlpool common stockholders and cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the following reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

*In the first quarter of 2012, the company recorded an effective GAAP tax rate of 27 percent. A 4 percent effective GAAP tax rate was recorded in the second quarter driven by the timing of tax planning. The company has made an adjustment to its ongoing business operations EPS in the second quarter to reflect a first half rate of 25 percent which is consistent with the new full-year tax rate assumption.
