Item 1.01 .
Entry into Material Definitive Agreements
On February 9, 2006, the Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of Valor Communications Group, Inc. (the "Company") adopted the 2006 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan"), pursuant to which selected management employees of the Company, including executive management, may receive a cash incentive award. The Plan will be administered by the Company's senior management and awards will be calculated based upon the Company's financial performance (determined by reference to EBITDA targets established under the Plan from time to time). The Plan will operate through the closing of the merger agreement executed on December 8, 2005 among the Company, Alltel Corporation and Alltel Holdings Corp. (the "Merger"). Assuming the Company achieves its financial goals, participants in the Plan will receive a pro-rata payout calculated through the date of the closing of the Merger.
On February 9, 2006, the Company executed amendments to its Employment Agreements and Restricted Stock Agreements with John J. Mueller, Jerry E. Vaughn, William M. Ojile, Jr., Grant Raney, Cynthia B. Nash and Randal S. Dumas, in order to implement retention and severance terms approved by the Compensation Committee on December 8, 2005 in connection with the Merger. In addition, on December 8, 2005, the Compensation Committee determined that the closing of the Merger will constitute a "Change in Control" as that term is defined in such senior executives' Employment Agreements and Restricted Stock Agreements.
The Plan and the Employment Agreement and Restricted Stock Agreement amendments are attached as Exhibits hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

(the "Company") for company and individual performance. This will be accomplished by providing eligible employees with financial awards for attainment of revenue and operational objectives. The accomplishment of these goals will be measured through the attainment of the following elements as defined in Part II:
alor
The Plan sets forth the guidelines and formulas for the computation of incentive compensation awards for participating employees.
     
1.2 Definitions
Definitions of terms as used throughout the Plan document are as follows:
     
1.3 Administration
The Committee has delegated to the Chief Executive Officer and the senior executive team ("Executive Management") the responsibility to develop and administer the Plan. The Vice President  Human Resources of the Company shall administer the Plan in accord with direction provided by Executive Management. The Committee shall approve the Plan prior to its implementation.
Executive Management shall have full power and authority to select Participants from among those eligible, to determine the size and timing of individual awards, and to adopt and revise such rules and procedures as it shall deem necessary for the administration of the Plan. The decision of the Executive Management with respect to the individuals selected for awards, and the interpretation of the Plan shall be final and conclusive. All incentive compensation awards computed under the Plan are subject to final approval and modification of Executive Management. The Plan may be modified or withdrawn at any time without prior notification at the discretion of Executive Management.
 
 
     
1.4 Eligible Participants
Participation in the Plan shall be limited to regular salaried employees of the Company, including officers as recommended by management and approved by the Committee. In selecting Participants, Executive Management shall consider an individual's job, individual performance objectives, and potential impact on the Company's business results and performance. Participants will be members of the participant groups as defined in Part II of the Plan. Participants should not be eligible to participate in any other incentive or bonus plan(s). The selection of Participants and their respective incentive awards, shall be determined annually by Executive Management and communicated to Participants as soon as possible. In actual practice, decisions on participation will be made at or near the beginning of the Award Year. Executive Management has the right to change or modify the participant list with or without notice.
Eligible employees are full-time employees who are selected to participate in the Plan (as defined above), and are employed by the Company during the entire Award Year for which the incentive is being paid. If an employee becomes eligible during the Award Year and would otherwise be eligible to participate in the incentive compensation plan, at the discretion of the department Senior Vice-President and the Chief Executive Officer, the individual may be allowed to participate. This Participant would receive pro-rated incentive award based on the full months that he or she is eligible and the End of the Year. Employees who become eligible after January 1 of the Award Year will not be eligible to participate.
     
1.5 Awards
Individual Participant awards are determined based on quantitative and qualitative performance measurements as described by the Incentive Factors in Part II. All award payments are subject to Executive Management approval. The Committee shall review Awards payable under the Plan to the Chief Executive Officer and other senior officers. Awards will be made in the form of cash.
     
1.6 Payment of Awards

Participants must be full-time employees on the Company's payroll at the end of the Award Year. Awards will be pro-rated based on the Participant's annual Incentive Potential Target to the nearest month in the Award Year.
Normal Payment
If termination of employment occurs during an Award Year because of death, total disability, or approved leave of absence, such Participant terminating employment shall be deemed to have earned a proportionate share of what would have otherwise been the Award Year's actual incentive. The amount paid will be prorated to the number of full months worked, and based on the Final Incentive Award calculation.
Payment Under Conditions of Termination.
 
 
If termination of employment occurs for any reason other than death, total disability, or approved leave of absence, no incentive shall be deemed earned for the Award Year in which such termination occurs.
. If a Participant is transferred to another unit/department, etc. within or affiliated with the Company during the Award Year, and is determined to be eligible for payments under one or both of the units' plans, partial awards will be made under each unit's plan, using the respective job and salary and prorated as describe in Section 1.4.

2  Operating Rules
     
2.1 Plan Principles
The purpose of the Plan as defined in Part I is to provide Participants with annual incentive awards for their contributions to the Company's growth and achievement of strategic goals. The Plan will be operated on the following principles:
The Company will set the Participant's incentive factors on an annual basis and revise them during the Award Year as needed.
The Company, through its managers, will review performance of Participants . The measurement may be either quantitative or qualitative.
The Company will pay Awards to the Participants, according to the measured results, within fifteen (15) days of the end of the Award Year.
     
2.2 Plan Structure
The Plan is based on incentive factors important to the Company's success in achieving its strategic objectives that have been adopted by resolution of the Company's Board of Directors . Plan Participants are divided into groups with similar job responsibilities and/or job functions. Executive Management will make a determination as to which group a Participant will be assigned, using the criteria below as a guideline:
 
The groups are assigned incentive factors for which they have responsibility, control, or influence. Factor weights will be assigned to the incentive factors for the groups. The total factor weight allocated to each should equal 100 percent. Factor weights are allocated only to the incentive factors that have been assigned to the groups and not all factors may have weights.
     
2.3 Incentive Factors
Incentive factors are elements through which the Company achieves strategic goals and will be used by the Plan to measure the success of Participants to help the Company reach its goals. The Committee has selected one incentive factor for measurement in the Plan. This factor is as follows:
Senior management, department management, and eligible Participants will establish goals for each of these incentive factors. Participants with "Unsatisfactory" individual performance are not eligible for any payout under the Plan.
          
2.3.1 Company Performance (as measured by EBITDA)
Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) is a measure of financial performance that is used to measure the Company's performance. At the beginning of each year, the Company's Board of Directors shall adopt a resolution setting the EBITDA goals. At the end of the year, actual EBITDA achievement will be compared to the EBITDA goal and the percentage of achievement will be determined. Executive Management reserves the right to consider extraordinary expenses and revenues in consideration for End of Year Award.
 
 
          
2.3.1.1 EBITDA Evaluation Score Table
The score table defines the achievement level expected by the Company. The incentive level represents the percent of the incentive that the Participant will receive depending on the level of EBITDA attained by the Company. Higher levels of achievement will yield higher incentive levels and consequently increase incentive award.
          
2.3.1.2 EBITDA End of Award Year
At the end of the Award Year, senior management will compare actual EBITDA results with EBITDA goals and determine incentive level based on attainment. Executive Management reserves the right to adjust the incentive level, either increasing or decreasing, based on unusual or extenuating circumstances.
          
2.3.2 Individual Performance Evaluation and Objectives
Due to the pending Transaction, individual performance evaluation will not be performed during the Award year. To be eligible for Final Incentive Award, Participants are expected to report to work as scheduled and to perform the duties required of his/her position to the best of his/her abilities to ensure that the Company will achieve its financial targets.
Participants performing at "Unsatisfactory" levels will not be eligible for payout under the Plan.
     
2.4 Assigning Incentive Factors to Groups
Incentive factors are assigned to the groups that have responsibility, control, and influence over them. Plan participants should constantly review these factors and their goals, monitoring their progress and adjusting their priority to meet their goals. Incentive factor goals serve as constant reminders as to which areas Participants should focus their efforts.
 
 
     
2.5 Allocating Incentive Factors and Weights to Groups
The incentive factors assigned to each participant group were examined carefully to determine which factors should be allocated to the group level. Participant groups were allocated the incentive factors they have the most control over. These will be the focal point of the groups' efforts.
Next, a weight is distributed among the factors assigned to each group based on the importance each factor plays in relation to reaching the set goals. The factor weight is the percentage of the factor allocated to a specific group. The total factor weight for each group should equal 100 percent.
     
2.6 Incentive Potential
Incentive potential is defined as the percentage of the annual salary designated to each participant group. This equals to the annual salary multiplied by the assigned percentage. The assigned percentage increases with the responsibility level of the group.
 
Information for individual plan Participants is confidential and will be disclosed to each plan Participant in a private manner. Group directors and managers will only have access to the incentive compensation source data pertaining to their department or work group.
     
2.7 Award Calculation Method
All award calculations will be performed by the Human Resources Department based on EBITDA and Revenue results as communicated by the Committee and Performance Evaluation Ratings as communicated by department management. The formulas for calculations are outlined in this section.
          
2.7.1 The Performance Potential Factor (PPF)
The Participant's performance in each incentive factor allocated is measured in or according to the Plan guidelines. A score is assigned for each factor based on the actual results achieved for that Award Year. The Participant's score in each factor category is multiplied by the factor weight allocated to it and divided by 100. Adding all factor category scores times their weights yields the Performance Potential Factor (PPF).
The Performance Potential Factor is a cumulative index that represents the overall Participant performance in achieving the assigned goals. The Performance Potential Index reflects how well Participants have achieved their goals in their respective incentive factors
          
2.7.2 Incentive Potential Factor (IPF)
Each Participant in the Plan is designated an Incentive Potential Factor. The value of this factor is determined by a percentage of the Participant's annual income as defined in section 2.6.
          
2.7.3 The Final Incentive Award (FIA)
The Final Incentive Award is calculated as follows:
