Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
VALOR Communications Group, Inc. (NYSE:VCG) today reported first quarter consolidated financial and operating results and will host a conference call today at 10:00 a.m. (EDT) to discuss these results and its business.
IRVING, Texas, May 15, 2006 
Highlights for the Quarter
"I am pleased to report cash available to pay dividends (CAPD) of nearly $39 million with healthy Adjusted EBITDA margins and strong gains in our DSL and long distance subscribers," commented Jack Mueller, VALOR Communications Group, Inc. president and chief executive officer. "Our DSL penetration, based on lines capable of receiving the service, increased to 16% from 9% a year ago. In addition, our long distance penetration increased to 46% from 42% a year ago."
Revenue of $125.6 million in the first quarter of 2006 was relatively flat with the prior year. Net income was $16.0 million in the first quarter of 2006, resulting in quarterly EPS (earnings per share) of $0.23 per share.
For the first quarter of 2006, revenue from data services and other services increased 29.1% and 15.5%, respectively, due to increased DSL subscribers and increases in equipment sales, directory advertising and wholesale services. Revenue from local service, access and Universal
 
Service Fund decreased 6.6%, 1.7% and 2.8%, respectively, compared to last year's first quarter due primarily to access line losses.
Capital expenditures were $10.2 million in the first quarter of 2006 and DSL service is now available to 72% of VALOR's total access lines. Cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2006 were $69.8 million.
Merger with Alltel Wireline
"We're on track to obtain all required federal and state regulatory and governmental approvals necessary to close the transaction" stated Mueller. "VALOR and the Alltel Wireline transition teams are working closely together to implement the transition plans laid out earlier this year. We expect the merger to close in July."

Non-GAAP Measures
VALOR uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its performance and liquidity. These include adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA), Adjusted EBITDA margin and "Cash Available to Pay Dividends." These non-GAAP financial measures are by definition not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and are not alternatives to operating income or net income reflected in the statement of operations or to cash flow as reflected in the statement of cash flows and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs.
VALOR presents Adjusted EBITDA because covenants in its credit facility contain ratios based on this measure. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are included in the schedules that follow.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined in the credit facility as: (1) consolidated adjusted net income, as defined therein; plus (2) the following items, to the extent deducted from consolidated adjusted net income: (a) interest expense; (b) provision for income taxes; (c) depreciation and amortization; (d) certain expenses related to VALOR's initial public offering of common stock, its recent debt recapitalization and the other transactions described in "Use of Proceeds" in its registration statement for its initial public offering of common stock completed February 9, 2005; (e) other nonrecurring or unusual costs or losses incurred after the closing date of its new credit facility, to the extent not exceeding $10.0 million; (f) unrealized losses on financial derivatives recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 133; (g) losses on sales of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and (h) all other non-cash charges that represent an accrual for which no cash is expected to be paid in a future period; minus (3) the following items, to the extent any of them increases consolidated adjusted net income; (v) income tax credits; (w) interest and dividend income (other than in respect of Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative patronage distribution); (x) gains on asset disposals not in the ordinary course of business; (y) unrealized gains on financial derivatives recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 133; and (z) all other non-cash income.
 
Adjusted EBITDA margin is equal to adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin measures the proportion of Adjusted EBITDA remaining after deducting operating expenses.
Cash Available to Pay Dividends is defined herein as Adjusted EBITDA less the sum of (i) any item excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA that has been or will be settled in cash, (ii) cash interest expense, (iii) capital expenditures, (iv) required cash pension contributions in excess of expense, and (v) cash income taxes.
VALOR considers Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Cash Available to Pay Dividends (CAPD) as important indicators to investors in the company's common stock because CAPD provides information related to the company's ability to provide cash flows to service debt, fund capital expenditures and pay dividends. If VALOR's Adjusted EBITDA were to decline below certain levels, covenants in its credit facility that are based on Adjusted EBITDA, including its interest coverage ratio and total leverage ratio covenants, may be violated and could cause, among other things, a default or mandatory prepayment under its credit facility, or result in its inability to pay dividends. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and CAPD are not measures in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and CAPD should not be used as a substitute for VALOR's various cash flow measures (e.g., operating, investing and financing cash flows). The non-GAAP financial measures used by VALOR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
While VALOR utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures in managing and analyzing its business and financial condition and believes these measures are useful to management and to investors for the reasons described above, these non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings. In particular, Adjusted EBITDA does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayments and interest payments are not deducted from such measure. Management compensates for the shortcomings of these measures by utilizing them in conjunction with their comparable GAAP financial measures. The information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes contained in documents filed periodically with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
