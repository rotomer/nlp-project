Gardner, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Francis X. Frantz, Chairman in connection with grants of equity awards to those executive officers.
     The restricted shares granted to the CEO will vest in three equal installments on August 1, 2007, August 1, 2008 and August 1, 2009 but only if Windstream achieves certain minimum annual financial measures (which measures for 2006 have been prorated for the partial period beginning July 17, 2006). The awards to the CEO will immediately vest upon the death or permanent disability of the grantee or if the grantee's employment with Windstream is terminated without cause (as defined in the agreement), or the grantee terminates his employment with Windstream for good reason (as defined in the agreement), in each case within the two year period immediately following a change in control of Windstream.
     The restricted shares granted to Chairman will either vest in three equal installments on August 1, 2007, August 1, 2008 and August 1, 2009 or vest in whole on August 1, 2009, depending upon the award granted. The awards to the Chairman vest if he continues in service until the applicable vesting dates, and the Chairman shall be deemed to have remained in the continuous service of Windstream until the last to occur of his termination of employment or he ceases to be a director. The awards to the Chairman will immediately vest upon the death or permanent disability of the grantee or immediately following a change in control of Windstream.

Exhibit 10.1
Summary of Restricted Share Grant
     Windstream Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), grants to the Grantee named below, in accordance with the terms of the Windstream Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan") and this Restricted Shares Agreement (the "Agreement"), the following number of Restricted Shares, on the Date of Grant set forth below:
Terms of Agreement
     . Subject to and upon the terms, conditions, and restrictions set forth in this Agreement and in the Plan, the Company hereby grants to the Grantee as of the Date of Grant, the total number of Restricted Shares (the "Restricted Shares") set forth above. The Restricted Shares shall be fully paid and nonassessable.
1. Grant of Restricted Shares
     .
2. Vesting of Restricted Shares
          (a) The Restricted Shares shall vest and become nonforfeitable if the Grantee shall have remained in the continuous employ of the Company or a Subsidiary through the vesting dates set forth below with respect to the percentage of Restricted Shares set forth next to such date, provided that the Committee certifies in writing as of such date that the performance measure set forth in Section 2(d) (the "Performance Measure") for the applicable performance period specified below (each a "Performance Period") has been satisfied in full:
          (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2(a), all of the Restricted Shares covered by this Agreement (and not previously forfeited under Section 3) shall immediately become vested and nonforfeitable (without regard to whether the Performance
 
Measures have been satisfied) if, during the vesting period, the Grantee (i) dies or becomes permanently disabled (as determined by the Committee) while in the employ of the Company or a Subsidiary, or (ii) the Grantee's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries is terminated without Cause (as defined in Section 19), or the Grantee terminates his employment with the Company or a Subsidiary for Good Reason (as defined in Section 19), in each case within the two year period immediately following a Change in Control.
          (c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the time at which the Restricted Shares become vested and nonforfeitable on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, except to the extent that such action would result in the loss of the otherwise available exemption of the Restricted Shares under Section 162(m) of the Code.
          (d) For purposes of this Agreement, the specified Performance Measure for each Performance Period shall be based on the Company's operating income before depreciation and amortization ("OIBDA"). With respect to the Performance Period beginning July 17, 2006 and ending December 31, 2006, the Performance Measure shall be satisfied if the Company's OIBDA for such period is equal to or greater than $___. With respect to each of the Performance Periods beginning January 1, 2007 and January 1, 2008, the Committee shall establish in writing and communicate to the Grantee the applicable OIBDA target for each Performance Period not later than 90 days following the beginning of the applicable Performance Period, which such target shall not be greater than ___% of the OIBDA goal established by the Company for annual forecasting purposes. OIBDA shall be calculated for each Performance Period as operating income, plus depreciation and amortization expense, all of which shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. However, the calculation of OIBDA for each Performance Period shall exclude items of gain, income, loss or expense that are determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or that relate to the disposal of a segment of a business, or related to a change in accounting principle, all as determined in accordance with such generally accepted accounting principles.
     . The Restricted Shares that have not yet vested pursuant to Section 2 (including without limitation any cash dividends and non-cash proceeds related to the Restricted Shares for which the record date occurs on or after the date of forfeiture) shall be forfeited automatically without further action or notice (i) in the event that the Performance Measures for a Performance Period have not been achieved, but only with respect to the percentage of Restricted Shares set forth opposite such Performance Period in Section 2(a), and (ii) in the event the Grantee ceases to be employed by the Company or a Subsidiary other than as provided in Section 2(b). In the event of a forfeiture of the Restricted Shares, the stock book entry account representing the Restricted Shares covered by this Agreement shall be cancelled and all Restricted Shares shall be returned to the Company.
3. Forfeiture of Shares
     . The Restricted Shares may not be sold, exchanged, assigned, transferred, pledged, encumbered or otherwise disposed of by the Grantee, except to the Company, until the Restricted Shares have become nonforfeitable as provided in Section 2. Any purported transfer or encumbrance in violation of the provisions of this Section 4 shall be void, and the other party to any such purported transaction shall not obtain any rights to or interest in such Restricted Shares. The Committee, in its sole discretion, when and as is permitted by the
4. Transferability
 
Plan, may waive the restrictions on transferability with respect to all or a portion of the Restricted Shares, provided that any permitted transferee (other than the Company) shall remain subject to all the terms and conditions applicable to the Restricted Shares prior to such transfer.
     . Except as otherwise provided herein, from and after the Date of Grant, the Grantee shall have all of the rights of a stockholder with respect to the Restricted Shares, including the right to vote the Restricted Shares and receive any cash dividends that may be paid thereon (which such dividends shall be paid no later than the end of the calendar year in which the dividends are paid to the holders of the Common Shares or, if later, the 15th day of the third month following the date the dividends are paid to the holders of the Common Shares); , , that any additional Common Shares or other securities that the Grantee may become entitled to receive pursuant to a stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, separation or reorganization or any other change in the capital structure of the Company shall be considered Restricted Shares and shall be subject to the same restrictions as the Restricted Shares covered by this Agreement. Any cash dividends paid with respect to the Restricted Shares shall be reported on the Grantee's annual wage and tax statement (Form W-2) as compensation and shall be subject to all applicable tax withholdings as provided in Section 10.
5. Dividend, Voting and Other Rights
provided
however
     ; Until the Restricted Shares have become vested and nonforfeitable as provided in Section 2, the Restricted Shares shall be issued in book-entry only form and shall not be represented by a certificate. The restrictions set forth in this Agreement shall be reflected on the stock transfer records maintained by or on behalf of the Company. By execution of this Agreement and effective until the Restricted Shares have become vested and nonforfeitable as provided in Section 2, the Grantee hereby irrevocably constitute and appoint Jeffery R. Gardner, Brent Whittington, or John P. Fletcher, or any of them, attorneys-in-fact to transfer the Restricted Shares on the stock transfer records of the Company with full power of substitution. The Grantee agrees to take any and all other actions (including without limitation executing, delivering, performing and filing such other agreements, instruments and documents) as the Company may deem necessary or appropriate to carry out and give effect to the provisions of this Agreement.
6. Custody of Restricted Shares

     . For purposes of this Agreement, the continuous employment of the Grantee with the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be deemed to have been interrupted, and the Grantee shall not be deemed to have ceased to be an employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries, by reason of the transfer of his employment among the Company and its Subsidiaries or a leave of absence approved by the Committee.
7. Continuous Employment
     .

8. No Employment Contract
     .

The Company does not guarantee any particular tax treatment or results in connection with the grant or vesting of the Restricted Shares or the payment of dividends. If the Company or any Subsidiary is required to withhold any federal, state, local or other taxes in connection with the delivery or vesting of the Restricted Shares, the Grantee shall pay the tax or make provisions that are satisfactory to the Company or such Subsidiary for the payment thereof. The Grantee may elect to satisfy all or any portion of any such withholding obligation by surrendering to the Company or such Subsidiary a portion of the Common Shares that become vested and nonforfeitable hereunder, and the Common Shares so surrendered by the Grantee shall be credited against any such withholding obligation at the Market Value per Share of such Common Shares on the date of such surrender.

however
     . Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee may modify this Agreement upon written notice to the Grantee.

13. Amendments
     .

14. Severability
     . This Agreement is subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. This Agreement and the Plan contain the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter contained in this Agreement, and supersede all prior written or oral communications, representations and negotiations in respect thereto.

For purposes of this definition, no act, or failure to act, on the Grantee's part shall be deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by the Grantee not in good faith and without reasonable belief that the Grantee's act, or failure to act, was in the best interest of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
          (b) "Good Reason" shall mean the occurrence, without the Grantee's express written consent, of any one of the following: (i) the assignment to the Grantee of any duties
