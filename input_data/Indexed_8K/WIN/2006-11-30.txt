Windstream claims the protection of the safe-harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual future events and results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs, and assumptions and are not guarantees of future events and results. Actual future events and results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of important factors. Representative examples of these factors include (without limitation) adverse changes in economic conditions in the regions in which Windstream operates; the extent, timing and overall effects of competition in the communications business; material changes in the communications industry generally that could adversely affect vendor relationships with equipment and network suppliers and customer relationships with wholesale customers; changes in communications technology; the risks associated with the integration of acquired businesses; the potential for adverse changes in the ratings given to Windstream's debt securities by nationally accredited ratings organizations; the availability and cost of financing in the corporate debt markets; the uncertainties related to Windstream's strategic investments; the effects of workstoppages; the effects of litigation; potential outcome of income tax audits; the effects of federal and state legislation, rules and regulations governing the communications industry; product liability and other claims asserted against Windstream; and the risks that are described in the sections entitled "risk factors" and "special note concerning forward-looking statements" in the company's proxy statement/prospectus-information statement dated May 26, 2006, and in Windstream's other filings with the SEC. In addition to these factors, actual future performance, outcomes, and results may differ materially because of other, more general, factors including (without limitation) general industry and market conditions and growth rates, economic conditions, and governmental and public policy changes. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and Windstream has no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.
