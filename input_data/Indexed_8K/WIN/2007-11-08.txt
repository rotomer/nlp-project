Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On November 8, 2007, Windstream Corporation ("Windstream" or the "Company") issued a press release announcing the Company's third quarter 2007 unaudited consolidated results of operations. The press release presents the Company's consolidated results of operations measured under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and certain unaudited pro forma results of operations from current businesses, which are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. A "non-GAAP financial measure" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's financial statements. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Windstream Corporation has entered into various transactions over the last two years that may cause results reported under GAAP to be not necessarily indicative of future results. On July 17, 2006, Windstream Corporation was formed through the spin off of Alltel Corporation's ("Alltel") wireline telecommunications business to its shareholders, and the subsequent merger of that wireline business with Valor Communications Group, Inc. ("Valor"). The GAAP results for the Company for periods prior to this transaction reflect only the Alltel wireline business, which was considered the accounting acquirer in the merger. Additionally, the Company has announced that it will split off its directory publishing business to Welsh, Carson, Anderson, and Stowe ("WCAS"), a private equity investment group and Windstream shareholder, in a transaction expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2007. In exchange for Windstream's publishing business, Windstream will receive a special dividend of $40.0 million, receive approximately $210.0 million in debt relief through a debt-for-debt exchange and retire approximately 19.6 million shares in Windstream common stock currently held by WCAS. On August 31, 2007, Windstream completed the acquisition of CT Communications, Inc. ("CTC"). Under the terms of the transaction CTC shareholders received $31.50 in cash for each of their shares of CTC common stock.
The press release includes a presentation of unaudited pro forma results of operations from current businesses that reflect the following adjustments to measures prepared in accordance with GAAP:
 
Windstream's purpose for including the results of acquired businesses, and excluding the directory publishing business and the non-recurring items listed above, is to improve the comparability of results of operations for the three and nine month periods of 2006 to the results of operations for the same periods of 2007. Windstream's purpose for these adjustments is to focus on the true earnings capacity associated with providing telecommunication services. Management believes the items either included or excluded from the pro forma results from current businesses are related to strategic activities or other events, specific to the time and opportunity available, and, accordingly, should be excluded when evaluating the Company's operations. The Company's presentation of pro forma results from current businesses includes severance expenses, as these types of expenses should not necessarily be viewed as non-recurring.
For these reasons, management believes that presenting current business measures assists investors by providing more meaningful comparisons of results from current and prior periods and by providing information that is a better reflection of the core earnings capacity of the businesses. The Company uses pro forma results from current businesses as a key measure of the operational performance of its business segments. Windstream management, including the chief operating decision-maker, uses these measures consistently for all purposes, including internal reporting purposes, the evaluation of business objectives, opportunities and performance, and the determination of management compensation.
The Company's press release, and other communications from time to time, include a non-GAAP measure titled operating income before depreciation and amortization, or OIBDA. OIBDA can be calculated directly from the Company's financial statements by taking operating income and adding back depreciation and amortization expense. The Company will also at times make reference to pro forma OIBDA from current businesses, which is also a non-GAAP measure. Pro forma OIBDA from current businesses adjusts OIBDA for the items that are either included or excluded from pro forma results from current businesses. Management considers OIBDA to be useful to investors because OIBDA provides information specific to the Company's operating performance.
The Company's communications from time to time include a non-GAAP measure entitled net debt. Net debt is consolidated debt, including current maturities, less cash and cash equivalents. The Company believes net debt provides useful information to investors about the Company's capital structure.
The Company will also from time to time include non-GAAP measures entitled "free cash flow" and "dividend payout ratio". Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided from operations less net cash used in investing activities. The Company believes free cash flow provides the investor useful information about cash available to pay dividends. Dividend payout ratio is defined as dividends paid on common shares divided by free cash flow. The Company believes the dividend payout ratio provides the investor useful information about its remaining investable funds after the payment of dividends to shareholders.

Exhibit 99(a)
Windstream reports solid third-quarter results
Release date: Nov. 8, 2007
LITTLE ROCK, Ark.  Windstream Corporation (NYSE: WIN) generated solid financial results in the third quarter through higher revenue from sales of broadband and data services.
"Windstream delivered a solid financial performance in the third quarter, while continuing to drive broadband and digital TV sales," said Jeff Gardner, president and CEO. "We also completed our acquisition of CT Communications and are very pleased with the progress we have made integrating the new operations. We expect to complete the integration process by the end of the first quarter of 2008."
Windstream completed its acquisition of CT Communications, Inc. (CTC) on Aug. 31. The transaction nearly doubled Windstream's presence in North Carolina by adding 132,000 access lines and 31,000 broadband customers.
Windstream achieved diluted earnings per share under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of 25 cents for the third quarter. The GAAP results include results for the company's directory publishing business and CTC for the month of September in addition to one-time transaction expenses associated with the CTC acquisition and the split-off of the publishing business scheduled to close during the fourth quarter.
Among the highlights for the third quarter on a GAAP basis:
 
 
 
Among the pro forma highlights for the third quarter from current businesses:
 
 
 
 
Windstream's pro forma results from current businesses include CTC results for the entire third quarter and exclude results for Windstream's directory publishing business and transaction expenses associated with the publishing split-off and the CTC acquisition.
On a pro forma basis from current businesses, which include CTC results solely for the month of September, Windstream generated $792 million in revenues and $411 million in operating income before depreciation and amortization during the third quarter.
Operational highlights
Windstream added more than 48,000 broadband customers, bringing its total broadband customer base to approximately 830,000  an increase of 32 percent year-over-year and a penetration rate of 26 percent of total access lines.
The company added more than 27,000 digital TV customers, bringing its total digital TV customer base to approximately 178,000  an increase of 189 percent year-over-year and a penetration rate of 5 percent of total lines.
Total access lines declined approximately 46,000. Total lines at the end of the quarter were 3.24 million, a 4.7 percent decline year-over-year.
Windstream also announced it has received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding the split-off of the company's directory publishing business in a tax-free transaction to Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, a private equity investment firm. Windstream will repurchase approximately 19.6 million shares, retire approximately $210 million in debt and receive roughly $40 million in cash for additional debt retirement or stock repurchase through the transaction, which was originally announced on Dec. 12, 2006. Windstream expects to close the transaction by the end of the fourth quarter.
Windstream was formed July 17, 2006, through the spinoff from Alltel and merger with VALOR Communications Group, Inc.
Windstream's GAAP results reflect the Alltel wireline business for the entire year of 2006 through the third quarter of 2007; the VALOR business starting July 17, 2006; and CTC's business starting Sept. 1, 2007. Pro forma results from current businesses are non-GAAP financial measures that include results from VALOR and CTC for periods prior to the merger, and excludes various non-recurring items related to the transactions, the discontinuance of SFAS No. 71 and the
split-off of the company's directory publishing business. A reconciliation of pro forma results from current businesses to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the following financial schedules.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED RECONCILIATIONS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS UNDER GAAP TO PRO FORMA RESULTS FROM CURRENT BUSINESSES-Page 6
Windstream Corporation has entered into various transactions over the last two years that may cause results reported under GAAP to be not necessarily indicative of future results. On July 17, 2006, Windstream Corporation was formed through the spin off of Alltel Corporation's ("Alltel") wireline telecommunications business to its shareholders, and the subsequent merger of that wireline business with Valor Communications Group, Inc. ("Valor"). On December 12, 2006, Windstream announced that it would split off its directory publishing business to Welsh, Carson, Anderson, and Stowe ("WCAS"), a private equity investment group and Windstream shareholder. In exchange for Windstream's publishing business, Windstream will receive a special dividend of $40.0 million, receive approximately $210.0 million in debt relief through a debt-for-debt exchange and retire approximately 19.6 million shares in Windstream common stock currently held by WCAS. On August 31, 2007, Windstream completed the acquisition of CT Communications, Inc. ("CTC"). Under the terms of the transaction CTC shareholders received $31.50 in cash for each of their shares of CTC common stock. As disclosed in the Windstream Form 8-K filed on November 8, 2007, the Company has presented in this earnings release unaudited pro forma results from current businesses, which include results from Valor and CTC for periods prior to their acquisitions and excludes (1) results from the directory publishing business, (2) the impact of discontinuing SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," and (3) all restructuring charges resulting from the transactions discussed above.
Windstream's purpose for including the results of the acquired businesses, and excluding non-recurring items and the results of the directory publishing business, is to improve the comparability of results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007 to the results of operations for the same periods of 2006. Windstream's purpose for these adjustments is to focus on the true earnings capacity associated with providing telecommunication services. Management believes the items either included or excluded from pro forma results from current businesses are related to strategic activities or other events, specific to the time and opportunity available, and, accordingly, should be excluded when evaluating the Company's operations. In the second quarter of 2007, the Company revised its presentation of historical pro forma results by adding back severance expenses that were previously excluded in prior quarters. These types of restructuring expenses should not necessarily be viewed as non-recurring. For these reasons, management believes that presenting current business measures assists investors by providing more meaningful comparisons of results from current and prior periods, and by providing information that is a better reflection of the core earnings capacity of the businesses. The Company uses pro forma results from current businesses, including pro forma revenues and sales and pro forma OIBDA from current businesses, as a key measure of the operational performance of its business segments. Windstream management, including the chief operating decision-maker, uses these measures consistently for all purposes, including internal reporting purposes, the evaluation of business objectives, opportunities and performance, and the determination of management compensation.
