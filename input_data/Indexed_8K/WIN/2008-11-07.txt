Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On November 7, 2008, Windstream Corporation ("Windstream" or the "Company") issued a press release announcing the Company's third quarter 2008 unaudited consolidated results of operations. The press release presents the Company's consolidated results of operations measured under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and certain unaudited pro forma results of operations from current businesses, which are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. A "non-GAAP financial measure" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's financial statements. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Windstream Corporation has entered into various transactions over the last year that may cause results reported under GAAP to be not necessarily indicative of future results. On August 31, 2007, Windstream completed the acquisition of CT Communications, Inc. ("CTC"). Subsequently, the Company reached a definitive purchase agreement dated August 7, 2008, for the sale of the wireless business acquired from CTC. Upon consummation, we will have no significant continuing involvement in the operations or cash flows of the wireless business. In the second quarter of 2008, we have classified these operations as held for sale, recognized a pre-tax loss of $18.0 million to reduce the net carrying value of the assets and liabilities held for sale to the contemplated transaction price less costs to sell, and reported the operating results of the wireless business as discontinued operations. In the third quarter of 2008, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $6.5 million to reduce the carrying value of certain wireless spectrum licenses designated as held for sale, and not used in operations, to their fair market value. The fair market value of these holdings has been reduced to a nominal amount due to an impairment resulting from general market conditions and limited interest on this bandwidth of spectrum. Additionally, on November 30, 2007, Windstream completed the split off of its directory publishing business (the "publishing business") in a tax-free transaction with entities affiliated with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe ("WCAS"), a private equity investment firm.
The press release includes a presentation of unaudited pro forma results of operations from current businesses that reflect the following adjustments to measures prepared in accordance with GAAP:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Windstream's purpose for including the results of the acquired business, and excluding the directory publishing business, CTC wireless business and the non-recurring items listed above, is to improve the comparability of results of operations for periods in 2007 to the results of operations for the same periods of 2008. Windstream's purpose for these adjustments is to focus on the true earnings capacity associated with providing telecommunication services. Management believes the items either included or excluded from the pro forma results from current businesses are related to strategic activities or other events, specific to the time and opportunity available, and should be treated accordingly when evaluating the Company's operations. The Company's presentation of pro forma results from current businesses includes restructuring charges, consisting primarily of severance expenses, as these types of expenses should not necessarily be viewed as non-recurring.
For these reasons, management believes that presenting current business measures assists investors by providing more meaningful comparisons of results from current and prior periods and by providing information that is a better reflection of the core earnings capacity of the businesses. The Company uses pro forma results from current businesses as a key measure of the operational performance of its business segments. Windstream management, including the chief operating decision-maker, uses these measures consistently for all purposes, including internal reporting, the evaluation of business objectives, opportunities and performance, and the determination of management compensation.
 
The Company's press release, and other communications from time to time, include a non-GAAP measure titled operating income before depreciation and amortization, or OIBDA. OIBDA can be calculated directly from the Company's financial statements by taking operating income and adding back depreciation and amortization expense. The Company will also at times make reference to pro forma OIBDA from current businesses, which is also a non-GAAP measure. Pro forma OIBDA from current businesses adjusts OIBDA for the items that are either included or excluded from pro forma results from current businesses. Management considers OIBDA to be useful to investors because OIBDA provides information specific to the Company's operating performance.
The Company's communications from time to time include a non-GAAP measure entitled net debt. Net debt is consolidated debt, including current maturities, less cash and cash equivalents. The Company believes net debt provides useful information to investors about the Company's capital structure.
The Company will also from time to time include non-GAAP measures entitled "free cash flow" and "dividend payout ratio". Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided from operations less net cash used in the procurement of property, plant and equipment. The Company believes free cash flow provides the investor useful information about cash available to pay dividends. Dividend payout ratio is defined as dividends paid on common shares divided by free cash flow. The Company believes the dividend payout ratio provides the investor useful information about its remaining investable funds after the payment of dividends to shareholders.

Exhibit 99a
Windstream delivers solid results in third quarter
 
Release date: Nov. 7, 2008
LITTLE ROCK, Ark.  Windstream Corporation (NYSE: WIN) delivered solid operating results in the third quarter, including a much improved performance in access line retention than the same period a year ago.
"Our business continues to perform well despite the challenging economic environment and stress within the overall capital markets," said Jeff Gardner, president and CEO. "Our team delivered industry-leading operating results again during the third quarter, although our financial performance was pressured somewhat by higher fuel costs and storm-related expenses from Hurricane Ike."
The company also incurred a non-cash accounting charge of $6.5 million during the quarter to adjust the value of its wireless spectrum holdings in North Carolina acquired in the purchase of CT Communications last year.
"Our business continues to remain relatively defensive in this challenging economy given our rural footprint and the growing importance of the broadband connection to consumers. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to sustain the free cash flow this business generates and feel our current capital structure is appropriate. Our balance sheet is in a very good position and we do not have any significant debt maturities until 2013," Gardner said.
Third-quarter financial results:

Windstream ended the quarter with $112 million in cash and cash equivalents. Free cash flow, which is defined as net cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $510 million through the first nine months of the year, an increase of 23 percent year-over-year.
Third-quarter operating results:
Windstream added more than 28,000 new high-speed Internet customers during the third quarter, bringing its total customer base to approximately 963,000  an increase of almost 16 percent year-over-year. Overall broadband penetration is now 31 percent of total access lines and 47 percent of primary residential lines.
"We believe we can continue to grow our high-speed Internet customer base, as well as drive additional revenue growth by selling faster speeds," Gardner said.
Windstream added nearly 21,000 digital TV customers in the quarter, bringing its total customer base to approximately 252,000, or 14 percent penetration of primary residential lines.
Total access lines declined by 38,000, an improvement of more than 8,000 lines lost over the same period a year ago. Total lines at the end of the quarter were 3.08 million, a decline of 4.8 percent year-over-year.
FCC approves sale of North Carolina wireless properties
Windstream announced it has received FCC approval for the sale of its wireless properties in North Carolina to AT&T for $60 million in cash.

The transaction includes approximately 52,000 wireless customers; spectrum licenses and cell sites covering a four-county area of North Carolina with a population of approximately 450,000; and six retail locations. The properties operate under the Windstream Wireless brand name.
Windstream acquired the wireless properties in the acquisition of CT Communications, which offered co-branded wireless products and services through a joint operating agreement with AT&T.
The transaction is expected to close before the end of the year.
For the third quarter, the wireless properties generated roughly $12 million in revenue and $3 million in OIBDA. The wireless results are reflected as discontinued operations in the company's earnings results pending the sale.

The company has approximately 3.1 million access lines and about $3.2 billion in annual revenues. For more information, visit www.windstream.com.
Windstream was formed July 17, 2006, through the spinoff of Alltel's wireline business and its merger with VALOR Communications Group, Inc. The company acquired CT Communications (CTC) on Aug. 31, 2007.
Windstream's GAAP results reflect CTC's business starting Sept. 1, 2007. Pro forma results from current businesses are non-GAAP financial measures that include results from VALOR and CTC for periods prior to the mergers and exclude results from the split-off of the company's directory publishing business completed on Nov. 30, 2007 and the company's wireless properties. A reconciliation of pro forma results from current businesses to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the following financial schedules.
Windstream claims the protection of the safe-harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the sale of its wireless properties, are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual future events and results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs and assumptions that Windstream believes are reasonable but are not guarantees of future events and results. Actual future events and results of Windstream may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of important factors. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated above include, among others: adverse changes in economic conditions in the markets served by Windstream; the extent, timing and overall effects of competition in the communications business; continued access line loss; the impact of new, emerging or competing technologies; the adoption of inter-carrier compensation and/or universal service reforms by the Federal Communications Commission or Congress that results in a significant loss of revenue to Windstream; the risks associated with the integration of acquired businesses or the ability to realize anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities; the availability and cost of financing in the corporate debt markets; the potential for adverse changes in the ratings given to Windstream's debt securities by nationally accredited ratings organizations; the effects of federal and state legislation, rules and regulations governing the communications industry; material changes in the communications industry generally that could adversely affect vendor relationships with equipment and network suppliers and customer relationships

with wholesale customers; unexpected results of litigation; unexpected rulings by state public service commissions in proceedings regarding universal service funds, intercarrier compensation or other matters that could reduce revenues or increase expenses; the effects of work stoppages; the impact of equipment failure, natural disasters or terrorist acts; the ability to execute the company's share repurchase program or the ability to achieve the desired accretive effect from such repurchases; and those additional factors under the caption "Risk Factors" in Windstream's Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2007. In addition to these factors, actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially because of more general factors including, among others, general industry and market conditions and growth rates, economic conditions, and governmental and public policy changes. Windstream undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The foregoing review of factors that could cause Windstream's actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements should be considered in connection with information regarding risks and uncertainties that may affect Windstream's future results included in Windstream's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED RECONCILIATIONS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS UNDER GAAP TO PRO FORMA RESULTS FROM CURRENT BUSINESSES-Page 6
Windstream Corporation has entered into various transactions over the past two years that may cause results reported under GAAP to be not necessarily indicative of future results. On August 31, 2007, Windstream completed the acquisition of CT Communications, Inc. ("CTC"). Under the terms of the transaction CTC shareholders received $31.50 in cash for each of their shares of CTC common stock. Subsequently, on August 7, 2008, the Company reached a definitive purchase agreement for the sale of the wireless business acquired from CTC. Upon consummation, we will have no significant continuing involvement in the operations or cash flows of the wireless business. Accordingly, we have classified these operations as held for sale, recognized a pre-tax loss of $18.0 million to reduce the net carrying value of the assets and liabilities held for sale to the contemplated transaction price less costs to sell, and reported the operating results of the wireless business as discontinued operations. In the third quarter of 2008, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $6.5 million to reduce the carrying value of certain wireless spectrum licenses designated as held for sale, and not used in operations, to their fair market value. The fair market value of these holdings has been reduced to a nominal amount due to an impairment resulting from general market conditions and limited interest on this bandwidth of spectrum. On November 30, 2007, Windstream completed the split off its directory publishing business to Welsh, Carson, Anderson, and Stowe ("WCAS"), a private equity investment group and Windstream shareholder. In exchange for Windstream's publishing business, Windstream received a special cash dividend of $40.0 million, received $210.5 million in debt relief through a debt-for-debt exchange, and retired approximately 19.6 million shares in Windstream common stock held by WCAS. As a result of completing this transaction, Windstream recorded a gain of $451.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. As disclosed in the Windstream Form 8-K filed on November 7, 2008, the Company has presented in this earnings release unaudited pro forma results from current businesses, which include results from CTC's wireline business for periods prior to the acquisition and excludes (1) results from the directory publishing business, (2) results from the CTC wireless operations, (3) all merger and integration costs resulting from the transactions discussed above, and (4) $6.5 million non-cash impairment charge for acquired assets held for sale.
Windstream's purpose for including the results of the acquired businesses and for excluding non-recurring items, and the results of the directory publishing and wireless businesses, is to improve the comparability of results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2008, to the results of operations for the same periods of 2007. Windstream's purpose for these adjustments is to focus on the true earnings capacity associated with providing telecommunication services. Management believes the items either included or excluded from pro forma results from current businesses are related to strategic activities or other events, specific to the time and opportunity available, and should be treated accordingly when evaluating the Company's operations. Management believes that presenting current business measures assists investors by providing more meaningful comparisons of results from current and prior periods, and by providing information that is a better reflection of the core earnings capacity of the businesses. The Company uses pro forma results from current businesses, including pro forma revenues and sales and pro forma OIBDA from current businesses, as a key measure of the operational performance of its business segments. Windstream management, including the chief operating decision-maker, uses these measures consistently for all purposes including: internal reporting, the evaluation of business objectives, opportunities and performance, and the determination of management compensation.
