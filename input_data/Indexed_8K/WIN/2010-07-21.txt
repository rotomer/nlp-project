On July 19, 2010 (the "Closing Date"), Windstream Corporation (the "Company") announced that it had completed its previously announced private offering of its 8.125% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "Notes"). In connection with the issuance of the Notes, the Company entered into an Indenture, dated as of the Closing Date (the "Indenture"), among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company named therein, as guarantors (the "Guarantors"), and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, and a Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of the Closing Date (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), among the Company, the Guarantors, and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., and Goldman, Sachs & Co., as representatives of the several initial purchasers of the Notes (the "Initial Purchasers"). The Notes were offered only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. A copy of the press release announcing the completion of the offering of the Notes is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.
Indenture
Pursuant to the Indenture, the Company issued and sold to the Initial Purchasers $400 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The terms of the Indenture provide that, among other things, the Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and will rank equally with the Company's unsecured unsubordinated debt, senior to any of the Company's subordinated debt, and will effectively be subordinated to the Company's secured debt, including indebtedness under the Company's Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, to the extent of the assets securing such debt. The Company's obligations under the Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by all of the Company's domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.
Interest on the Notes accrues at a rate of 8.125% per annum. Interest on the Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on March 1, 2011. The Company will make each interest payment to the holders of record of the Notes on the immediately preceding February 15 and August 15.
. At any time prior to September 1, 2014, the Company may redeem all or part of the Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus (ii) a make-whole premium as of the date of redemption, plus (iii) accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, thereon, to the date of redemption. In addition, the Company may redeem some or all of the Notes on or after September 1, 2014, at redemption prices set forth in the Indenture, together with accrued and unpaid interest. At any time prior to September 1, 2013, the Company may use the proceeds of certain equity offerings to redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, including any permitted additional Notes, at a redemption price equal to 108.125% of the principal amount.
Optional Redemption
. Upon the occurrence of a change in control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture), each holder of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the Notes in cash at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the date of repurchase.
Repurchase upon Change of Control
. The Indenture contains covenants that limit, among other things, the Company's and certain of its subsidiaries' ability to (1) incur additional debt and issue preferred stock, (2) make certain restricted payments, (3) consummate specified asset sales, (4) enter into transactions with affiliates, (5) create liens, (6) declare or pay any dividend or make any other distributions, (7) make certain investments, and (8) merge or consolidate with another person.
Other Covenants
. The Indenture provides for customary events of default (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), which include non-payment, breach of covenants in the Indenture, payment defaults or acceleration of other indebtedness, a failure to pay certain judgments and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. Generally, if an event of default occurs, the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest, including additional interest, on all the Notes to be due and payable.
Events of Default
. The Company expects to use the net proceeds of the offering to repay the $300 million of outstanding indebtedness under its revolving credit facility as of June 30, 2010, and for general corporate purposes.
Use of Proceeds
The foregoing description of the Indenture and the Notes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Indenture and the Notes, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
Registration Rights Agreement
In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Company has agreed, pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, to file a registration statement (the "Exchange Offer Registration Statement") with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") with respect to a registered offer (the "Registered Exchange Offer") to exchange the Notes for new notes of the Company (the "Exchange Notes") having terms substantially identical in all material respects to the Notes within 120 days of the Closing Date, and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Offer Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act by the SEC, within 180 days of the Closing Date. The Exchange Notes will generally be freely transferable under the Securities Act.
In addition, the Company has agreed under certain circumstances to file one or more shelf registration statements to cover resales of the Notes. In the event that (i) applicable interpretations of the staff of the SEC do not permit the Company to effect a Registered Exchange Offer, (ii) for any other reason the Registered Exchange Offer is not consummated within 210 days of the Closing Date, (iii) an Initial Purchaser notifies the Company following consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer that Notes held by such Initial Purchaser are not eligible to be exchanged for the Exchange Notes in the Registered Exchange Offer, or (iv) certain holders of the Notes are not permitted to participate in the Registered Exchange Offer or do not receive fully tradable Exchange Notes pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer, the Company will, at its cost, (a) promptly file and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become effective no later than 210 days after the Closing Date a shelf registration statement with the SEC covering resales of the Notes and (b) use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the shelf registration statement continuously effective for a period of two years after its effective date (subject to certain exceptions).
If the Company fails to satisfy these obligations and its other obligations as set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company will be required to pay additional interest to the holders of the Notes. The Company agrees that if: (i) it does not file an Exchange Offer Registration Statement with respect to the Notes with the SEC on or prior to the 120th day following the Closing Date, (ii) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not declared effective on or prior to the 180th calendar day following the Closing Date, or (iii) the Exchange Offer is not consummated or a shelf registration statement is not declared effective, in each case on or prior to the 210th day following the Closing Date, (any event described in (i) through (iii) being referred to individually as a "Registration Default"), then the Company will pay additional cash interest on the Notes. The rate of the additional interest will be 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period immediately following the occurrence of a Registration Default, and such rate will increase by an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90-day period until all Registration Defaults have been cured, up to a maximum additional interest rate of 1.0% per annum. The Company will pay such additional interest on regular interest payment dates. Such additional interest will be in addition to any other interest payable from time to time with respect to the Notes and the Exchange Notes.
The foregoing description of the Registration Rights Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Registration Rights Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.3 and incorporated herein by reference.
Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates perform various financial advisory, investment banking and commercial banking services from time to time for the Company and its affiliates. They have received customary fees and commissions for these transactions. Each of the Initial Purchasers or its affiliates acts as a lender under our credit facilities. In addition, Citibank N.A. acts as a co-documentation agent under our senior secured credit facilities.

Forward Looking Statements
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual future events and results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs, and assumptions that Windstream believes are reasonable but are not guarantees of future events and results. Actual future events and results of Windstream may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of important factors. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated above include, among others: further adverse changes in economic conditions in the markets served by Windstream; the extent, timing and overall effects of competition in the communications business; continued voice line loss; the impact of new, emerging or competing technologies; the adoption of intercarrier compensation and/or universal service reform proposals by the Federal Communications Commission or Congress that results in a significant loss of revenue to Windstream; the risks associated with the integration of acquired businesses or the ability to realize anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities; for Windstream's competitive local exchange carrier operations, adverse effects on the availability, quality of service and price of facilities and services provided by other incumbent local exchange carriers on which Windstream's competitive local exchange carrier services depend; the availability and cost of financing in the corporate debt markets; the potential for adverse changes in the ratings given to Windstream's debt securities by nationally accredited ratings organizations; the effects of federal and state legislation, and rules and regulations governing the communications industry; material changes in the communications industry that could adversely affect vendor relationships with equipment and network suppliers and customer relationships with wholesale customers; unexpected results of litigation; unexpected rulings by state public service commissions in proceedings regarding universal service funds, inter carrier compensation or other matters that could reduce revenues or increase expenses; the effects of work stoppages; the impact of equipment failure, natural disasters or terrorist acts; earnings on pension plan investments significantly below Windstream's expected long term rate of return for plan assets; changes in federal, state and local tax laws and rates; and those additional factors under the caption "Risk Factors" in Windstream's Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2009, and in subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition to these factors, actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially because of more general factors including, among others, general industry and market conditions and growth rates, economic conditions, and governmental and public policy changes. Windstream undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The foregoing review of factors that could cause Windstream's actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K should be considered in connection with information regarding risks and uncertainties that may affect Windstream's future results included in Windstream's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov.

(d) Each Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article Six for the purposes of this Note Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article Six hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Note Guarantee.

Section 10.02.

To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Guarantor will be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article Ten, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Note Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to the Notes, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately by notice in writing to the Company specifying the Event of Default. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing as a result of the acceleration of any Indebtedness described in Section 6.01(a)(vi) of the Indenture, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the holders of all Indebtedness described in Section 6.01(a)(vi) of the Indenture have rescinded the declaration of acceleration in respect of such Indebtedness within 30 Business Days of the date of such declaration, and if the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, and all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.
Defaults and Remedies
In the case of any Event of Default occurring by reason of any willful action or inaction taken or not taken by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries with the intention of avoiding payment of the premium that the Company would have had to pay if the Company then had elected to redeem the Notes pursuant to Section 3.07 of the Indenture, an equivalent premium shall also become and be immediately due and payable to the extent permitted by law upon the acceleration of the Notes.
Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of the Notes notice of any Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal or interest or Additional Interest) if and so long as a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of the Holders of the Notes. If certain conditions are satisfied, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or Additional Interest on, or the principal of, the Notes.
11. . The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may become a creditor of, or otherwise deal with the Company or any of its Affiliates, with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.

Registration Under the 1933 Act
2.1 . The Company and the Guarantors shall, for the benefit of the Holders, at their cost, (A) prepare and, not later than 120 days following the Closing Date, file with the SEC an Exchange Offer Registration Statement on an appropriate form under the 1933 Act with respect to a proposed Exchange Offer and the issuance and delivery to the Holders, in exchange for the Registrable Securities (other than Private Exchange Securities) of a like principal amount of Exchange Securities, (B) use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Offer Registration Statement to be declared effective under the 1933 Act within 180 days of the Closing Date and (C) use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Offer to be consummated not later than 210 days following the Closing Date. The Exchange Securities will be issued under the Indenture. Upon the effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, the Company and the Guarantors shall promptly commence the Exchange Offer, it being the objective of such Exchange Offer to enable each Holder eligible and electing to exchange Registrable Securities for Exchange Securities (assuming that such Holder (a) is not an affiliate of the Company within the meaning of Rule 405 under the 1933 Act, (b) is not a broker-dealer tendering Registrable Securities acquired directly from the Company for its own account, (c) acquired the Exchange Securities in the ordinary course of such Holder's business and (d) has no arrangements or understandings with any Person to participate in the Exchange Offer for the purpose of distributing the Exchange Securities, and has made representations to the Company to that effect) to transfer such Exchange Securities from and after their receipt without any limitations or restrictions under the 1933 Act and under state securities or blue sky laws.
Exchange Offer
In connection with the Exchange Offer, the Company and the Guarantors shall:
(a) mail as promptly as practicable after the Exchange Offer Registration Statement has been declared effective under the 1933 Act to each Holder a copy of the Prospectus forming part of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, together with any letter of transmittal and any related documents;
(b) keep the Exchange Offer open for acceptance for a period of not less than 30 calendar days after the date notice thereof is mailed to the Holders (or longer if required by applicable law) (such period referred to herein as the "Exchange Period");
(c) utilize the services of the Depositary for the Exchange Offer;
(d) permit Holders to withdraw tendered Registrable Securities at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time), on the last business day of the Exchange Period, by sending to the institution specified in the notice, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of such Holder, the principal amount of Registrable Securities delivered for exchange, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing such Holder's election to have such Registrable Securities exchanged;
 
(e) notify each Holder that any Registrable Security not tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest, but will not retain any rights under this Agreement (except in the case of the Initial Purchasers and Participating Broker-Dealers as provided herein); and
(f) otherwise comply in all respects with all applicable laws relating to the Exchange Offer.
If, prior to consummation of the Exchange Offer, an Initial Purchaser holds any Initial Securities acquired by them and having the status of an unsold allotment in the initial distribution, the Company and the Guarantors upon the request of any such Initial Purchaser shall, simultaneously with the delivery of the Exchange Securities in the Exchange Offer, issue and deliver to such Initial Purchaser in exchange (the "Private Exchange") for the Initial Securities held by such Initial Purchaser, a like principal amount of debt securities of the Company on a senior basis, that are identical (except that such securities shall bear appropriate transfer restrictions) to the Exchange Securities (the "Private Exchange Securities"). For the avoidance of doubt, such Exchange Securities shall be likewise guaranteed by the Guarantors.
The Exchange Securities and the Private Exchange Securities shall be issued under (i) the Indenture or (ii) an indenture identical in all material respects to the Indenture and which, in either case, has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "TIA"), or is exempt from such qualification and shall provide that the Exchange Securities shall not be subject to the transfer restrictions set forth in the Indenture but that the Private Exchange Securities shall be subject to such transfer restrictions. The Indenture or such indenture shall provide that the Initial Securities, the Exchange Securities and the Private Exchange Securities shall vote and consent together on all matters as one class and that none of the Exchange Securities, the Private Exchange Securities or the Initial Securities will have the right to vote or consent as a separate class on any matter. The Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to have the Private Exchange Securities bear the same CUSIP number as the Exchange Securities. Neither the Company nor any of the Guarantors shall have any liability under this Agreement solely as a result of such Private Exchange Securities not bearing the same CUSIP number as the Exchange Securities.
As soon as practicable after the close of the Exchange Offer and/or the Private Exchange, as the case may be, the Company and the Guarantors shall:
(i) accept for exchange all Registrable Securities duly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Exchange Offer in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement and the letter of transmittal which shall be an exhibit thereto;
(ii) accept for exchange all Initial Securities properly tendered pursuant to the Private Exchange;
 
(iii) deliver to the Trustee for cancellation all Registrable Securities so accepted for exchange; and
(iv) cause the Trustee promptly to authenticate and deliver Exchange Securities or Private Exchange Securities, as the case may be, to each Holder of Registrable Securities so accepted for exchange in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Registrable Securities of such Holder so accepted for exchange.
Interest on each Exchange Security and Private Exchange Security will accrue from the last date on which interest was paid on the Registrable Securities surrendered in exchange therefor (or if the Exchange Security or Private Exchange Security is authenticated between a record date and an interest payment date with respect to the Registrable Securities surrendered in exchange therefor, from such interest payment date) or, if no interest has been paid on such Registrable Securities, from the Closing Date. The Exchange Offer and the Private Exchange shall not be subject to any conditions, other than (i) that the Exchange Offer or the Private Exchange, or the making of any exchange by a Holder, does not violate applicable law or any applicable interpretation of the staff of the SEC, (ii) the due tendering of Registrable Securities in accordance with the Exchange Offer and the Private Exchange, (iii) that each Holder of Registrable Securities exchanged in the Exchange Offer shall have represented that all Exchange Securities to be received by it shall be acquired in the ordinary course of its business and that at the time of the consummation of the Exchange Offer it shall have no arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution (within the meaning of the 1933 Act) of the Exchange Securities and shall have made such other representations as may be reasonably necessary under applicable SEC rules, regulations or interpretations to render the use of Form S-4 or other appropriate form under the 1933 Act available, (iv) all governmental approvals which the Company reasonably deems necessary for the consummation of the Exchange Offer and the Private Exchange shall have been obtained and (v) that no action or proceeding shall have been instituted or threatened in any court or by or before any governmental agency with respect to the Exchange Offer or the Private Exchange which, in the Company's judgment, would reasonably be expected to impair the ability of the Company or any of the Guarantors to proceed with the Exchange Offer or the Private Exchange. The Company shall inform the Initial Purchasers of the names and addresses of the Holders to whom the Exchange Offer is made, and the Initial Purchasers shall have the right to contact such Holders and otherwise facilitate the tender of Registrable Securities in the Exchange Offer.
2.2 . (i) If, because of any changes in law, SEC rules or regulations or applicable interpretations thereof by the staff of the SEC, the Company is not permitted to effect the Exchange Offer as contemplated by Section 2.1 hereof, (ii) if for any other reason the Exchange Offer is not consummated within 210 days after the Closing Date, (iii) upon the request of any of the Initial Purchasers with respect to Registrable Securities not eligible to be exchanged for Exchange Securities in the Exchange Offer or (iv) if a Holder is not permitted to participate in the Exchange Offer or does not receive fully tradable Exchange Securities pursuant to the Exchange Offer, then in case of each of clauses (i) through (iv) the Company and the Guarantors shall, at their cost:
Shelf Registration
 
(a) file with the SEC and use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be declared effective no later than 210 days after the Closing Date, a Shelf Registration Statement relating to the offer and sale of the Registrable Securities by the Holders from time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution elected by the Majority Holders participating in the Shelf Registration and set forth in such Shelf Registration Statement.
(b) Use their commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective in order to permit the Prospectus forming part thereof to be usable by Holders for a period of one year from the date the Shelf Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, or for such shorter period that will terminate when all Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement or cease to be outstanding or otherwise to be Registrable Securities (the "Effectiveness Period"); , that the Effectiveness Period in respect of the Shelf Registration Statement shall be extended to the extent required to permit dealers to comply with the applicable prospectus delivery requirements of Rule 174 under the 1933 Act and as otherwise provided herein.
provided, however
(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, use their commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that (i) any Shelf Registration Statement and any amendment thereto and any Prospectus forming part thereof and any supplement thereto complies in all material respects with the 1933 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, (ii) any Shelf Registration Statement and any amendment thereto does not, when it becomes effective, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (iii) any Prospectus forming part of any Shelf Registration Statement, and any supplement to such Prospectus (as amended or supplemented from time to time), does not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
The Company and the Guarantors shall not permit any securities other than Registrable Securities to be included in the Shelf Registration Statement. The Company and the Guarantors further agree, if necessary, to supplement or amend the Shelf Registration Statement, as required by Section 3(b) below, and to furnish to the Holders of Registrable Securities copies of any such supplement or amendment promptly after its being used or filed with the SEC.
2.3 . The Company shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with the registration pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.2. Each Holder shall pay all underwriting discounts and commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of such Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement.
Expenses
 
2.4. . (a) The Company and the Guarantors will be deemed not to have used their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be, to become, or to remain, effective during the requisite period if the Company or any of the Guarantors voluntarily takes any action that would, or omits to take any action which omission would, result in any such Registration Statement not being declared effective or in the Holders of Registrable Securities covered thereby not being able to exchange or offer and sell such Registrable Securities during that period as and to the extent contemplated hereby, unless such action is required by applicable law.
Effectiveness
(b) An Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof or a Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC; , that if, after it has been declared effective, the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to an Exchange Offer Registration Statement or a Shelf Registration Statement is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or any other governmental agency or court, such Registration Statement will be deemed not to have become effective during the period of such interference, until the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement may legally resume.
provided, however
2.5 . In the event that either (a) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not filed with the SEC on or prior to the 120th calendar day following the Closing Date, (b) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement has not been declared effective on or prior to the 180th calendar day following the Closing Date or (c) the Exchange Offer is not consummated or a Shelf Registration Statement is not declared effective, in either case, on or prior to the 210th calendar day following the Closing Date (each such event referred to in clauses (a) through (c) above, a ""), the interest rate borne by the Initial Securities shall be increased (such additional interest being referred to as "") by 0.25% per annum upon the occurrence of each Registration Default, which rate will be further increased by 0.25% each 90-day period that such Additional Interest continues to accrue under any such circumstance, that the maximum aggregate increase in the interest rate of Initial Securities will in no event exceed 1% per annum. Following the cure of all Registration Defaults, the accrual of Additional Interest will cease and the interest rate will revert to the original rate.

provided
 
If the Shelf Registration Statement is unusable by the Holders for any reason, and the aggregate number of days in any consecutive twelve-month period for which the Shelf Registration Statement shall not be usable exceeds 30 days in the aggregate, then the interest rate borne by the Initial Securities shall be increased by 0.25% per annum of the principal amount of the Initial Securities for the first 90-day period (or portion thereof) beginning on the 31
st
such date that such Shelf Registration Statement ceases to be usable, which rate shall be increased by an additional 0.25% per annum of the principal amount of the Initial Securities at the beginning of each subsequent 90-day period, that the maximum aggregate increase in the interest rate of Initial Securities will in no event exceed 1% per annum. Any amounts payable under this paragraph shall also be deemed "Additional Interest" for purposes of this Agreement. Upon the Shelf Registration Statement once again becoming usable, the interest rate borne by the Initial Securities will be reduced to the original interest rate if the Company and the Guarantors are otherwise in compliance with this Agreement at such time. Additional Interest shall be computed based on the actual number of days elapsed in each 90-day period in which the Shelf Registration Statement is unusable.
provided

(q) (i) in the case of an Exchange Offer Registration Statement, a reasonable time prior to the filing of any Exchange Offer Registration Statement, any Prospectus forming a part thereof, any amendment to an Exchange Offer Registration Statement or amendment or supplement to such Prospectus or any free writing prospectus, provide copies of such document to the Initial Purchasers and to counsel to the Holders of Registrable Securities and make such changes in any such document prior to the filing thereof as the Initial Purchasers or counsel to the Holders of Registrable Securities may reasonably request and, except as otherwise required by applicable law, not file any such document in a form to which the Initial Purchasers on behalf of the Holders of Registrable Securities and counsel to the Holders of Registrable Securities shall not have previously been advised and furnished a copy of or to which the Initial Purchasers on behalf of the Holders of Registrable Securities or counsel to the Holders of Registrable Securities shall reasonably object, and make the representatives of the Company or any Guarantor available for discussion of such documents as shall be reasonably requested by the Initial Purchasers; and
(ii) in the case of a Shelf Registration, a reasonable time prior to filing any Shelf Registration Statement, any Prospectus forming a part thereof, any amendment to such Shelf Registration Statement or amendment or supplement to such Prospectus or any free writing prospectus, provide copies of such document to the Holders of Registrable Securities, to the Initial Purchasers, to counsel for the Holders and to the underwriter or underwriters of an underwritten offering of Registrable Securities, if any, make such changes in any such document prior to the filing thereof as the Initial Purchasers, the counsel to the Holders or the underwriter or underwriters reasonably request and not file any such document in a form to which the Majority Holders, the Initial Purchasers on behalf of the Holders of Registrable Securities, counsel for the Holders of Registrable Securities or any underwriter shall not have previously been advised and furnished a copy of or to which the Majority Holders, the Initial Purchasers on behalf of the Holders of Registrable Securities, counsel to the Holders of Registrable Securities or any underwriter shall reasonably object, and make the representatives of the Company or any Guarantor available for discussion of such document as shall be reasonably requested by the Holders of Registrable Securities, the Initial Purchasers on behalf of such Holders, counsel for the Holders of Registrable Securities or any underwriter.
(r) in the case of a Shelf Registration, use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Registrable Securities to be listed on any securities exchange on which similar debt securities issued by the Company are then listed if reasonably requested by the Majority Holders, or if requested by the underwriter or underwriters of an underwritten offering of Registrable Securities, if any;
(s) in the case of a Shelf Registration, use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registrable Securities to be rated by the appropriate rating agencies, if so requested by the Majority Holders, or if requested by the underwriter or underwriters of an underwritten offering of Registrable Securities, if any;
 
(t) otherwise comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement covering at least 12 months which shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the 1933 Act and Rule 158 thereunder;
(u) cooperate and assist in any filings required to be made with the FINRA and, in the case of a Shelf Registration, in the performance of any due diligence investigation by any underwriter and its counsel (including any "qualified independent underwriter" that is required to be retained in accordance with the rules and regulations of the FINRA); and
(v) upon consummation of an Exchange Offer or a Private Exchange, obtain a customary opinion of counsel to the Company and the Guarantors as may be required by the Trustee.
In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Company may (as a condition to such Holder's participation in the Shelf Registration) require each Holder of Registrable Securities to furnish to the Company such information regarding the Holder and the proposed distribution by such Holder of such Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing. The Company may exclude from such Shelf Registration Statement the Registrable Securities of any Holder who fails to furnish such information within a reasonable time (not to exceed 15 business days) after receiving such request and shall be under no obligation to compensate any such Holder for any lost income, interest or other opportunity forgone, or any liability incurred, as a result of the Company's decision to exclude such Holder in accordance with this paragraph.
In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event or the discovery of any facts, each of the kind described in Section 3(e)(v) hereof, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 3(k) hereof, and, if so directed by the Company, such Holder will deliver to the Company (at its expense) all copies in such Holder's possession, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice.
If any of the Registrable Securities covered by any Shelf Registration Statement are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the underwriter or underwriters and manager or managers that will manage such offering will be selected by the Majority Holders of such Registrable Securities included in such offering and shall be acceptable to the Company. No Holder of Registrable Securities may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such Holder (a) agrees to sell such Holder's Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company and the Guarantors shall be under no obligation to participate in any underwritten offering with respect to the Registrable Securities in connection with the Shelf Registration and no such underwritten offering shall be effected pursuant to this Agreement without the prior consent of the Company.
4. .
Indemnification; Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser, each Holder, each Participating Broker-Dealer, each Person who participates as an underwriter (any such Person being an "Underwriter") and each Person, if any, who controls any Holder or Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows:
(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) pursuant to which Exchange Securities or Registrable Securities were registered under the 1933 Act, including all documents incorporated therein by reference, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433 under the 1933 Act ("Issuer Free Writing Prospectus") or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 4(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by any indemnified party), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under subparagraph (i) or (ii) above;
 
, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by an Initial Purchaser, Holder or Underwriter expressly for use in a Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
provided, however
(b) Each Holder severally, but not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantors, each Initial Purchaser, each Underwriter and the other selling Holders, and each of their respective directors and officers, and each Person, if any, who controls the Company, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, any Underwriter or any other selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in Section 4(a) hereof, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Shelf Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any Prospectus included therein (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with written information with respect to such Holder furnished to the Company by such Holder expressly for use in the Shelf Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus; , that no such Holder shall be liable for any claims hereunder in excess of the amount of net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement.
provided, however
(c) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action or proceeding commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure so to notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying party or parties be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 4 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d) If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 4(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
(e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 4 is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Holders and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Holders and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the Guarantors, the Holders or the Initial Purchasers and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company, the Guarantors, the Holders and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 4 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 4. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 4 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4, no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Initial Securities sold by it were offered exceeds the amount of any damages which such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 4, each Person, if any, who controls an Initial Purchaser or Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Initial Purchaser or Holder, and each director of the Company, and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Initial Purchasers' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 4 are several in proportion to the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule A to the Purchase Agreement and not joint.
5. .

If any transferee of any Holder shall acquire Registrable Securities, in any manner, whether by operation of law or otherwise, such Registrable Securities shall be held subject to all of the terms of this Agreement, and by taking and holding such Registrable Securities such person shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to perform all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including the restrictions on resale set forth in this Agreement and, if applicable, the Purchase Agreement, and such person shall be entitled to receive the benefits hereof.

provided
5.6 .
