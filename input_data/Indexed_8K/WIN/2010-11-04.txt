On November 4, 2010, Windstream Corporation ("Windstream" or the "Company") issued a press release announcing the Company's third quarter 2010 unaudited consolidated results of operations. The press release presents the Company's consolidated results of operations measured under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") and certain unaudited pro forma results of operations from current businesses, which are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. A "non-GAAP financial measure" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's financial statements. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Windstream Corporation has entered into the following pending and completed transactions that may cause results reported under GAAP to be not necessarily indicative of future results:
Pending Acquisition
 
Completed Acquisitions
 
 
 
 
Dispositions
 
The unaudited consolidated results from current businesses presented on a pro forma basis either include or exclude the following items when compared to measures prepared in accordance with GAAP:
Includes:
 
Excludes:
 
 
Windstream's purpose for including the preacquisition results of D&E, Lexcom, NuVox and Iowa Telecom and for excluding non-recurring items and the results of the disposed operations is to improve the comparability of results of operations for periods in 2009 to the results of operations for the same periods of 2010 in order to focus on the true earnings capacity associated with providing telecommunication services.
The Company uses pro forma results from current businesses as a key measure of its operational performance. Windstream management, including the chief operating decision-maker, uses these measures consistently for all purposes, including internal reporting, the evaluation of business objectives, opportunities and performance, and the determination of management compensation.
The Company's press release, and other communications from time to time, include a non-GAAP measure titled operating income before depreciation and amortization, or OIBDA. OIBDA can be calculated directly from the Company's financial statements by taking operating income and adding back depreciation and amortization expense. The Company will also at times make reference to pro forma OIBDA from current businesses, which is also a non-GAAP measure. Pro forma OIBDA from current businesses adjusts OIBDA for the items that are either included or excluded from pro forma results from current businesses. Management considers OIBDA to be useful to investors because OIBDA provides information specific to the Company's operating performance.
 
 
In addition, from time to time the Company's communications will also include the following non-GAAP measures:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.A
Windstream reports third-quarter earnings results
 
Release date: Nov. 4, 2010
LITTLE ROCK, Ark.Windstream Corp. (Nasdaq: WIN) today reported third-quarter results highlighted by improved revenue trends and growth in adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA).
"I am very pleased with our third quarter results. We are executing well on all fronts as evidenced by the improving revenue trends in both our business and consumer channels. In addition, our integration efforts of recent acquisitions are proceeding as planned," said Jeff Gardner, Windstream president and CEO.
Windstream's third-quarter results under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) include approximately $7 million in after-tax merger and integration costs, which lowered earnings per share by roughly 2 cents.
Third-quarter financial results:
Under GAAP:
 
 
 
 
Under pro forma results:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Third-quarter pro forma operating results:
Windstream added approximately 15,700 new high-speed Internet customers during the third quarter, bringing its total customer base to approximately 1.29 millionan increase of 8 percent year-over-year. Overall broadband penetration is now 42 percent of total voice lines and 60 percent of primary residential lines.
Windstream also added more than 13,000 digital TV customers in the quarter, bringing its total customer base to approximately 433,000, or 22 percent penetration of primary residential lines.
Total access lines declined by approximately 30,700, resulting in a year-over-year decline of 3.7 percent. Total lines at the end of the quarter were 3.3 million.
In the business channel, advanced data and integrated solutions, which are largely connections providing both voice and data services, increased 1 percent year-over-year. Special access circuits were up 5
percent year-over-year due to increased bandwidth demand from wireless carriers.
Pension contribution
During the quarter, Windstream made a voluntary contribution of $41 million in cash to its pension plan to preserve its 2010 credit balance, which can be used to offset future contributions.
Given the current low discount rate, the company also announced it is likely that it will make a contribution to the pension plan in 2011 ranging from $60 million to $90 million to avoid benefit restrictions. The contribution in 2011 is likely to be in the form of Windstream stock in order to manage overall net debt leverage.
Updated financial outlook for 2010
Windstream updated its expected free cash flowdefined as adjusted OIBDA, excluding merger and integration costs, minus cash interest, cash taxes, capital expenditures and pension contributionsfor 2010 as a result of extended bonus depreciation rules and other tax savings.
The company expects to generate $814 million to $859 million in expected free cash flow in 2010, resulting in a dividend payout ratio between 54 percent and 57 percent. The company's previous guidance projected $770 million to $810 million in expected free cash flow and a dividend payout ratio between 57 percent and 60 percent.
The updated expected free cash flow guidance assumes expected cash taxes of $105 million to $120 million and pension contributions of $41 million for 2010.
Expected free cash flow is not pro forma and reflects NuVox and Iowa Telecom on an actual basis from the date the businesses were acquired.

Dispositions
 
As disclosed in the Windstream Form 8-K furnished on November 4, 2010, the Company has presented in this earnings release unaudited pro forma results, which includes results from D&E, Lexcom, NuVox and Iowa Telecom for periods prior to the acquisitions and excludes results from the out-of-territory product distribution operations prior to the disposition and all merger and integration ("M&I") costs resulting from the completed and pending transactions discussed above. In addition to pro forma adjustments, the Company presented certain measures of its operating performance, excluding the impact of restructuring charges, pension and stock-based compensation.
Windstream's purpose for including the results of acquired businesses and for excluding non-recurring items, the results of disposed operations, restructuring charges, pension and stock-based compensation is to improve the comparability of results of operations for the nine month period ended September 30, 2010, to the results of operations for the same period of 2009 in order to focus on the true earnings capacity associated with providing telecommunication services. Additionally, management believes that presenting current business measures assists investors by providing more meaningful comparisons of results from current and prior periods, and by providing information that is a better reflection of the core earnings capacity of the businesses. The Company uses pro forma results, including pro forma revenues and sales, pro forma OIBDA and pro forma adjusted OIBDA as key measures of its operational performance. Windstream management, including the chief operating decision-maker, consistently use these measures for internal reporting and the evaluation of business objectives, opportunities and performance.
Windstream claims the protection of the safe-harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual future events and results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs and assumptions that Windstream believes are reasonable but are not guarantees of future events and results. Actual future events and results of Windstream may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of important factors. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated above include, among others: further adverse changes in economic conditions in the markets served by Windstream; the extent, timing and overall effects of competition in the communications business; continued voice line loss; the impact of new, emerging or competing technologies; the adoption of intercarrier compensation and/or universal service reforms by the Federal Communications Commission or Congress that results in a significant loss of revenue to Windstream; the risks associated with the integration of acquired businesses or the ability to realize anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities; for Windstream's competitive local exchange carrier operations, adverse effects on the availability, quality of service and price of facilities and services provided by other incumbent local exchange carriers on which Windstream's competitive local exchange carrier services depend; the availability and cost of financing in the corporate debt markets; the potential for adverse changes in the ratings given to Windstream's debt securities by nationally accredited ratings organizations; the effects of federal and state legislation, rules and regulations governing the communications industry; material changes in the communications industry generally that could adversely affect vendor relationships with equipment and network suppliers and customer relationships with wholesale customers; unfavorable results of litigation; unfavorable rulings by state public service commissions in proceedings regarding universal service funds, inter-carrier compensation or other matters that could reduce revenues or increase expenses; the effects of work stoppages; the impact of equipment failure, natural disasters or terrorist acts; earnings on pension plan investments significantly below our expected long term rate of return for plan assets; changes in federal, state and local tax laws and rates; and those additional factors under the caption "Risk Factors" in Windstream's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. In addition to these factors, actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially because of more general factors including, among others, general industry and market conditions and growth rates, economic conditions, and governmental and public policy changes. Windstream undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The foregoing review of factors that could cause Windstream's actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements should be considered in connection with information regarding risks and uncertainties that may affect Windstream's future results included in Windstream's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov.
