Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
On January 12, 2011, Windstream Corporation ("Windstream", "we" or the "Company") posted to its corporate website at m certain unaudited results of operations for each of the quarters ended September 30, 2010, June 30, 2010 , March 31, 2010, December 31, 2009, September 30, 2009, June 30, 2009 and March 31, 2009. These unaudited results of operations are presented on a pro forma basis to include the consolidated operating results of the Company with Q-Comm Corporation ("Q-Comm") and Hosted Solutions Acquisition, LLC ("Hosted Solutions"), which were acquired December 2, 2010 and December 1, 2010, respectively. In addition, information on revenues derived from consumer, business and wholesale customers has been included along with certain key operating metrics relative to each. These pro forma results of operations represent a "non-GAAP financial measure", which is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's financial statements. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Windstream Corporation has completed the following transactions that may cause results reported under GAAP to be not necessarily indicative of future results:
Acquisitions
Dispositions
The unaudited consolidated results from current businesses presented on a pro forma basis either include or exclude the following items when compared to measures prepared in accordance with GAAP:
Includes:
Excludes:
Windstream's purpose for including the preacquisition results of acquired businesses and for excluding non-recurring items and the results of the disposed operations is to provide investors with information which reflects the true earnings capacity of the Company's current businesses.
The Company uses pro forma results from current businesses as a key measure of its operational performance. Windstream management, including the chief operating decision-maker, uses these measures consistently for all purposes, including internal reporting, the evaluation of business objectives, opportunities and performance, and the determination of management compensation.
The Company's presentation of pro forma results of operations, and other communications from time to time, include a non-GAAP measure titled operating income before depreciation and amortization, or OIBDA.
 
OIBDA can be calculated directly from the Company's financial statements by taking operating income and adding back depreciation and amortization expense. The Company will also at times make reference to pro forma OIBDA from current businesses, which is also a non-GAAP measure. Pro forma OIBDA from current businesses adjusts OIBDA for the items that are either included or excluded from pro forma results from current businesses. Management considers OIBDA to be useful to investors because OIBDA provides information specific to the Company's operating performance. In addition, from time to time, the Company's communications will also include pro forma adjusted OIBDA, defined as pro forma OIBDA from current businesses adjusted to exclude the impacts of pension expense, restructuring charges and stock based compensation. Pro forma adjusted OIBDA is included to provide investors with useful information about the Company's operating performance before the impacts of restructuring and certain non-cash items in order to enhance the comparability of our operating results for the periods presented.
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.

In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information set forth in this Item 7.01 and in the attached exhibit shall be deemed to be "furnished" and not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").

Exhibit 99(a)
Windstream Corporation has entered into various transactions that may cause results reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP") to be not necessarily indicative of future results.

Completed Acquisitions

Dispositions
 
To assist investors in evaluating the results of its combined operations, the Company has provided the accompanying unaudited pro forma results, which includes results from D&E, Lexcom, NuVox, Iowa Telecom, Hosted Solutions and Q-Comm for periods prior to the acquisitions, and excludes results from the out-of-territory product distribution operations and all merger and integration costs resulting from the completed transactions discussed above. In addition to pro forma adjustments, the Company has presented certain measures of its operating performance, excluding the impact of restructuring charges, pension and stock-based compensation.
Windstream's purpose for including the results of the acquired businesses and for excluding non-recurring items, the results of the disposed operations, restructuring charges, pension and stock-based compensation is to improve the comparability of results of operations for all periods presented in order to focus on the true earnings capacity associated with providing telecommunication services. Additionally, management believes that presenting current business measures assists investors by providing more meaningful comparisons of results from current and prior periods, and by providing information that is a better reflection of the core earnings capacity of its current businesses. The Company uses pro forma results, including pro forma revenues and sales, pro forma OIBDA and pro forma adjusted OIBDA, as key measures of the operational performance of its business. Windstream management, including the chief operating decision-maker, consistently use these measures for internal reporting and the evaluation of business objectives, opportunities and performance.
Windstream claims the protection of the safe-harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual future events and results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs and assumptions that Windstream believes are reasonable but are not guarantees of future events and results. Actual future events and results of Windstream may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of important factors. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated above include, among others: further adverse changes in economic conditions in the markets served by Windstream; the extent, timing and overall effects of competition in the communications business; continued voice line loss; the impact of new, emerging or competing technologies; the adoption of intercarrier compensation and/or universal service reforms by the Federal Communications Commission or Congress that results in a significant loss of revenue to Windstream; the risks associated with the integration of acquired businesses or the ability to realize anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities; for Windstream's competitive local exchange carrier operations, adverse effects on the availability, quality of service and price of facilities and services provided by other incumbent local exchange carriers on which Windstream's competitive local exchange carrier services depend; the availability and cost of financing in the corporate debt markets; the potential for adverse changes in the ratings given to Windstream's debt securities by nationally accredited ratings organizations; the effects of federal and state legislation, rules and regulations governing the communications industry; material changes in the communications industry generally that could adversely affect vendor relationships with equipment and network suppliers and customer relationships with wholesale customers; unfavorable results of litigation; unfavorable rulings by state public service commissions in proceedings regarding universal service funds, inter-carrier compensation or other matters that could reduce revenues or increase expenses; the effects of work stoppages; the impact of equipment failure, natural disasters or terrorist acts; earnings on pension plan investments significantly below our expected long term rate of return for plan assets; changes in federal, state and local tax laws and rates; and those additional factors under the caption "Risk Factors" in Windstream's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. In addition to these factors, actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially because of more general factors including, among others, general industry and market conditions and growth rates, economic conditions, and governmental and public policy changes. Windstream undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The foregoing review of factors that could cause Windstream's actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements should be considered in connection with information regarding risks and uncertainties that may affect Windstream's future results included in Windstream's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov.
