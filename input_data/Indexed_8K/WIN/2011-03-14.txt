On March 14, 2011, Windstream Corporation ("Windstream") announced that it intends to offer in a private placement $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2021 (the "Offering"). The Offering is expected to be consummated in late March, subject to market and other conditions. If the Offering is successfully placed, Windstream expects to increase the maximum amount of 8.625% Senior Notes due 2016 ("2016 Notes") it is seeking in its previously announced tender offer. Windstream expects to use the net proceeds of the Offering, together with the net proceeds of its previously announced offering of 7.50% Senior Notes due 2023 and borrowings under its revolving line of credit or cash on hand, to pay the consideration in connection with the tender offer, together with accrued and unpaid interest on 2016 Notes tendered and accepted in the tender offer, as well as related fees and expenses. A copy of the press release announcing the Offering is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.
As of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 11, 2011, a total of approximately $1,036 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 2016 Notes had been tendered in the tender offer, and withdrawal rights for all such 2016 Notes tendered have expired. Windstream expects to increase the maximum amount of 2016 Notes sought in the tender offer by the aggregate principal amount of notes offered in the Offering. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at midnight, New York City time, on March 29, 2011, unless extended or earlier terminated.
In addition, Windstream plans to seek an additional $500 million of commitments under its revolving line of credit. If Windstream is successful, there would be a total of $1,250 million available for borrowing under its revolving line of credit.
