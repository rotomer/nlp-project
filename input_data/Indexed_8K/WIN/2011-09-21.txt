Item 8.01. Other Events.
On September 21, 2011, Windstream Corporation ("Windstream") contributed 5,900,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, to the Windstream Pension Plan to be held by the Windstream Master Trust. The contribution was made pursuant to an effective registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The shares have a current aggregate appraised value, as determined by a third party valuation firm that is not affiliated with Windstream, of approximately $75,170,000. The contribution will apply towards Windstream's remaining 2011 and its 2012 obligations to make contributions to the Plan. The amount and timing of future contributions to the Pension Plan are dependent upon a myriad of factors including future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and changes in the demographics of the population participating in our qualified pension plan.
Additional Information and Where to Find It
In connection with the proposed merger, Windstream has filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 with the SEC (Registration No. 333-176565) that contains a proxy statement/prospectus for the stockholders of PAETEC Holding Corp. ("PAETEC"). PAETEC investors and security holders are advised to read the proxy statement/prospectus and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC when they become available because those documents will contain important information about PAETEC, Windstream and the proposed merger of Peach Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Windstream, into PAETEC.
