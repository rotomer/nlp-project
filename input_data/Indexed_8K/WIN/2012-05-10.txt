Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On May 10, 2012, Windstream Corporation (Windstream or the Company) issued a press release announcing the Companys first quarter 2012 unaudited consolidated results of operations. The press release presents the Companys unaudited consolidated results of operations measured under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and certain unaudited pro forma results of operations from current businesses, which are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a companys financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the Companys financial statements. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Windstream Corporation has completed the following transaction that may cause results reported under GAAP to be not necessarily indicative of future results:
Completed Acquisition:
The unaudited consolidated results from current businesses presented on a pro forma basis either include or exclude the following items when compared to measures prepared in accordance with GAAP:
Includes:
Excludes:
Windstreams purpose for including the preacquisition results of PAETEC and for excluding merger and integration costs is to improve the comparability of results of operations for periods in 2011 to the results of operations for the same periods of 2012 in order to focus on the true earnings capacity associated with providing telecommunication services.
The Company uses pro forma results from current businesses as a key measure of its operational performance. Windstream management, including the chief operating decision-maker, uses these measures consistently for all purposes, including internal reporting, the evaluation of business objectives, opportunities and performance, and the determination of management compensation.
The Companys press release, and other communications from time to time, include a non-GAAP measure titled operating income before depreciation and amortization, or OIBDA. OIBDA can be calculated directly from the Companys financial statements by taking operating income and adding back depreciation and amortization expense. The Company will also at times make reference to pro forma OIBDA from current businesses, which is also a non-GAAP measure. Pro forma OIBDA from current businesses adjusts OIBDA for the items that are either included or excluded from pro forma results from current businesses. Management considers OIBDA to be useful to investors because OIBDA provides information specific to the Companys operating performance.
In addition, from time to time the Companys communications will also include the following non-GAAP measures:

Exhibit 99(a)
Windstream reports first-quarter results
Release date: May 10, 2012
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. - Windstream Corp. (Nasdaq: WIN) today reported first-quarter results, highlighted by strong sales to business customers and continued growth in consumer broadband revenues.
Our business and consumer channels delivered a strong performance during the first quarter, said Jeff Gardner, president and CEO of Windstream. The business channel has gained significant traction with the acquisition of PAETEC, and our combined team is having tremendous success driving new sales opportunities. Our consumer business also had a very solid quarter driven by growth in broadband service revenues and continued success with our bundling strategy.
Business service revenues were $897 million for the first quarter, up 3.2 percent from the same period a year ago on a pro forma basis.
Consumer broadband service revenues were $113 million, up 5.9 percent from the same period in 2011 on a pro forma basis. Overall consumer service revenues were $338 million, down 2.6 percent from the same period a year ago on a pro forma basis.
Business and consumer broadband revenues represented approximately 68 percent of Windstream's total revenues and sales in the quarter.
Wholesale revenues were $225 million, a decline of 6.3 percent from the same period a year ago on a pro forma basis due largely to the suspension and modification of certain wholesale products that were a part of the PAETEC portfolio.
Total revenues and sales were $1.55 billion in the first quarter, a decline of 0.5 percent from the same period a year ago on a pro forma basis. Adjusted Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization (OIBDA) was $594 million, a decrease of 1.6 percent on a pro forma basis. Adjusted OIBDA removes the impact of restructuring charges, pension expense and stock-based compensation.
I am extremely confident in the business that we have built. Through targeted acquisitions and our strategic growth initiatives, we have assembled an attractive set of assets capable of generating consistent cash flows to support our dividend over a long period of time and to provide other opportunities in the future to increase shareholder value, Gardner said.
Adjusted capital expenditures were $223 million in the quarter, excluding $3 million in integration capital, an 8.1 percent increase from the same period in 2011 on a pro forma basis.
In the first quarter under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Windstream reported total revenues and sales of $1.55 billion, operating income of $253 million and net income of $65 million, or 11 cents per share. That compares to net income of $29 million, or 6 cents per share, on total revenues of approximately $1 billion during the same period in 2011.
Exhibit 99(a)
GAAP results include approximately $14 million in after-tax merger and integration expense and an after-tax gain of roughly $1 million related to the early extinguishment of debt. Excluding these items, adjusted earnings per share would have been 13 cents for the first quarter.
Windstream generated $352 million in adjusted free cash flow in the quarter and paid approximately $147 million in dividends. Adjusted free cash flow is adjusted OIBDA, excluding merger and integration expense, minus cash interest, cash taxes and adjusted capital expenditures.
Windstream also completed two sales of wireless spectrum that the company obtained in previous acquisitions for approximately $57 million during the quarter.

Exhibit 99(a)
Windstream Corporation ("we," "us" or "our") has entered into various transactions, including the acquisition of PAETEC Holding Corp ("PAETEC"), that may cause results reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP") to be not necessarily indicative of future results. On November 30, 2011, we completed the acquisition of PAETEC in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $2.4 billion. PAETEC shareholders received 0.460 shares of our stock for each PAETEC share owned at closing. We issued 70.0 million shares and assumed equity awards shares for a total transaction value of $842.0 million, based on our closing stock price on November 30, 2011, and the fair value of the equity awards assumed. We also assumed PAETEC's debt, net of cash acquired, of approximately $1,591.3 million, which includes a net premium of $113.9 million based on the fair value of the debt on November 30, 2011 and bank debt of $99.5 million that was repaid on December 1, 2011.
As disclosed in our Form 8-K furnished on May 10, 2012, we have presented in this package unaudited pro forma results, which includes results from PAETEC for periods prior to the acquisition and excludes all merger and integration costs resulting from the completed transactions discussed above. PAETEC results include results from companies acquired by PAETEC for periods prior to those acquisitions and excludes the results of operations of the energy business acquired as part of PAETEC, which has been classified as discontinued operations. In addition to pro forma adjustments, we have presented certain measures of our operating performance, excluding the impact of restructuring charges, pension and stock-based compensation. We have made certain reclassifications and revisions to prior periods to conform with the current presentation.
Our purpose for including the results of the acquired businesses and for excluding non-recurring items, the results of the disposed operations, restructuring charges, pension and stock-based compensation is to improve the comparability of results of operations for the three month periods ended
March 31,
2012
, to the results of operations for the same periods of 2011 in order to focus on the true earnings capacity associated with providing telecommunication services. Additionally, management believes that presenting current business measures assists investors by providing more meaningful comparisons of results from current and prior periods, and by providing information that is a better reflection of the core earnings capacity of our current businesses. We use pro forma results, including pro forma revenues and sales, pro forma OIBDA , pro forma adjusted OIBDA, pro forma capital expenditures and adjusted free cash flow as key measures of the operational performance of our business. Our management, including the chief operating decision-maker, consistently uses these measures for internal reporting and the evaluation of business objectives, opportunities and performance.
We claim the protection of the safe-harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual future events and results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about expected levels of support from universal service funds or other government programs, expected rates of loss of voice lines or intercarrier compensation, expected increases in high-speed Internet and business data connections, our expected ability to fund operations, expected required contributions to our pension plan, capital expenditures and certain debt maturities from cash flows from operations, expected synergies and other benefits from completed acquisitions, expected effective federal income tax rates and forecasted capital expenditure amounts. These and other forward-looking statements include statements about our ability to generate cash flows in future periods and to pay our current dividend, and these statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs, and assumptions that we believe are reasonable but are not guarantees of future events and results. Our actual future events and results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of important factors. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements include, among others: further adverse changes in economic conditions in the markets served by us; the extent, timing and overall effects of competition in the communications business; the impact of new, emerging or competing technologies; the uncertainty regarding the implementation of the Federal Communications Commission's ("FCC") rules on intercarrier compensation, and the potential for the adoption of further rules by the FCC or Congress on intercarrier compensation and/or universal service reform proposals that result in a significant loss of revenue to us; the risks associated with the integration of acquired businesses or the ability to realize anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities; for certain operations where we lease facilities from other carriers, adverse effects on the availability, quality of service and price of facilities and services provided by other carriers on which our services depend; the availability and cost of financing in the corporate debt markets; the potential for adverse changes in the ratings given to our debt securities by nationally accredited ratings organizations; the effects of federal and state legislation, and rules and regulations governing the communications industry; material changes in the communications industry that could adversely affect vendor relationships with equipment and network suppliers and customer relationships with wholesale customers; unfavorable results of litigation; continued access line loss; unfavorable rulings by state public service commissions in proceedings regarding universal service funds, inter-carrier compensation or other matters that could reduce revenues or increase expenses; the effects of work stoppages; the impact of equipment failure, natural disasters or terrorist acts; earnings on pension plan investments significantly below our expected long term rate of return for plan assets or a significant change in the discount rate; and those additional factors under the caption Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.
In addition to these factors, actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially because of more general factors including, among others, general industry and market conditions and growth rates, economic conditions, and governmental and public policy changes. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The foregoing review of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements should be considered in connection with information regarding risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov.
