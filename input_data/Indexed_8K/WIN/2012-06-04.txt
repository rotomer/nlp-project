Item 8.01 Other Events
On May 31, 2012, Windstream Corporation (Windstream or the Company) issued a press release announcing that it is restructuring its management ranks to increase the efficiency of decision-making and position the Company for continued success. As a result, the Company expects to eliminate approximately 375 - 400 management positions, or roughly 3 percent of its total workforce of 14,500, as part of the restructuring, which is expected to be complete in the third quarter of 2012.
The Company anticipates incurring pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $20 million - $25 million during 2012, primarily associated with severance and related costs.
These estimated pre-tax restructuring and related charges represent the Company's estimate of future cash outlays for employee termination benefits.
The severance-related charges that the Company expects to incur in connection with the restructuring are subject to a number of assumptions, and actual results may vary materially.
