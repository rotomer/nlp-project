Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On August 8, 2012, Windstream Corporation ("Windstream") announced that it had obtained the consent of the requisite lenders to its previously announced proposed amendment and restatement of its existing senior secured credit facilities (the "Amendment and Restatement"). Among other things, the Amendment and Restatement: (i) provides for the incurrence of $900 million of additional term loans, the proceeds of which will be used to repay the credit facility revolver (without any reduction in commitments) and for general corporate purposes and (ii) modifies certain definitions and provisions, including without limitation the definition of Available Distributable Cash and the repayment of indebtedness covenant. The additional term loans create sufficient liquidity to refinance the debt maturing in 2013 without further need to raise incremental capital.
 
The foregoing description of the Amendment and Restatement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amendment and Restatement Agreement and the form of the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and 10.2 respectively, and which are incorporated herein by reference.
 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which is the administrative agent and collateral agent under Windstream's senior secured credit facilities, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., which served as lead arranger on the Amendment and Restatement and is a bookrunner and lead arranger under the senior secured credit facilities and an affiliate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., certain of the other lenders under Windstream's senior secured credit facilities, and certain of their respective affiliates have performed or may in the future perform various commercial banking, lending, investment banking, financial advisory, trustee, hedging or other services for Windstream and its subsidiaries and affiliates, for which they have received or will receive fees and reimbursement of expenses.

In addition, any Incremental Facility providing for term loans (
Incremental Term Loans
) shall not have a final maturity date earlier than the Tranche B-1 Maturity Date, the Tranche B-2 Maturity Date or the Tranche B-3 Maturity Date, or a Weighted Average Life to Maturity that is shorter than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the then-remaining Tranche B-1 Term Loans, Tranche B-2 Term Loans or Tranche B-3 Term Loans, for purposes of prepayments, be treated substantially the same as (and in any event no more favorably than) the Tranche B-1 Term Loans, the Tranche B-2 Term Loans and the Tranche B-3 Term Loans and otherwise have terms that are no more
59
favorable to the lenders providing such Incremental Facility than the terms applicable to the Tranche B-1 Term Loans or the Tranche B-2 Term Loans,
provided
that (v) if the Applicable Rate relating to any Incremental Term Loans exceeds the Applicable Rate relating to the Tranche B-1 Term Loans by more than 0.25%, the Applicable Rate relating to the Tranche B-1 Term Loans shall be adjusted to be equal to the Applicable Rate relating to such Incremental Term Loans, (w) if the Applicable Rate relating to any Incremental Term Loans exceeds the Applicable Rate relating to the Tranche B-2 Term Loans by more than 0.25%, the Applicable Rate relating to the Tranche B-2 Term Loans shall be adjusted to be equal to the Applicable Rate relating to such Incremental Term Loans, (x) if as a result of any adjustments made pursuant to the preceding clauses (v) and (w) the Applicable Rate relating to the Tranche B-1 Term Loans would exceed the Applicable Rate relating to the Tranche B-2 Term Loans, the Applicable Rate relating to the Tranche B-2 Term Loans shall be increased in the amount required to eliminate such excess, (y) any determination of the Applicable Rate relating to Incremental Loans, Tranche B-1 Term Loans or Tranche B-2 Term Loans under the foregoing clause (v), (w) or (x), as applicable, shall include all upfront or similar fees or original issue discount payable to the Lenders providing such Loans), (B) except with respect to pricing (subject to the following proviso) and scheduled amortization (subject to the preceding clause (A)(1)) or to the extent such term is effective only after the Tranche B-3 Maturity Date, any Incremental Term Loans shall have terms that are no more favorable to the lenders providing such Incremental Term Loans than the terms applicable to the Tranche B-3 Term Loans,
provided
, that if the All-in Yield of any Incremental Term Loans exceeds the All-in Yield of any Tranche B-3 Term Loans by more than 0.50%, the Applicable Rate relating to the Tranche B-3 Term Loans shall be adjusted so that the All-in Yield of such Incremental Term Loans shall not exceed the All-in Yield of the Tranche B-3 Loans by more than 0.50% and (C) any Incremental Facility providing for revolving loans (1) shall not have a final maturity date, or a commitment availability period that ends, earlier than the latest Revolving Maturity Date then applicable, (2) may be effected by increasing the Revolving Commitments then having a commitment availability period ending on the latest Revolving Maturity Date and (3) shall be subject to other terms that are similar to the terms then available in the bank financing market to companies having a credit quality similar to the Borrower as determined by a Financial Officer in good faith.
(iii)
    
Each notice from the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.01(i) shall set forth the requested amount and proposed terms of the relevant Incremental Facility. Such Incremental Facility may be provided by any existing Lender or Additional Lender which shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and (other than in the case of existing Lenders providing only term loans under such Incremental Facility) the Administrative Agent and the Syndication Agent;
provided
that no existing Lender shall be obligated to provide any Incremental Loans, unless it so agrees. Any Incremental Facility will be effected pursuant to an amendment (an 
Incremental Facility Amendment
) to this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrower, the Additional Lenders providing such Incremental Facility (and no other Lenders) and the Administrative Agent. Upon the effectiveness of any
60
Incremental Facility Amendment, each Additional Lender shall become a Lender under this Agreement with respect to its obligations under such Incremental Facility, and the commitments of the Additional Lenders in respect of such Incremental Facility shall become Commitments hereunder; and any Incremental Loans under such Incremental Facility shall, when made, constitute Loans under this Agreement. In addition, any Incremental Facility Amendment may, without the consent of any Lenders other than the Additional Lenders, effect such amendments to any Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.01(i) (including to provide for voting provisions applicable to the Additional Lenders comparable to the provisions of clause (B) of the second proviso of Section 9.02(b)). The effectiveness of an Incremental Facility Amendment shall, unless otherwise agreed to by the Administrative Agent and the Additional Lenders, be subject to the satisfaction on the date thereof (an 
Incremental Facility Closing Date
) of each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.03 (it being understood that all references to the date of such Borrowing in Section 4.03 shall be deemed to refer to the Incremental Facility Closing Date). The proceeds of Incremental Loans will be used only for working capital and other general corporate purposes (including to finance Permitted Acquisitions or Capital Expenditures, in each case to the extent otherwise permitted hereunder).
This Section 2.01(i) shall supercede any provisions in Section 2.17 or 9.02 to the contrary. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans. Amounts repaid or prepaid in respect of Term Loans may not be reborrowed.

Additional Conversions of Tranche B-1 Term Loans
. At any time after the Second ARCA First Amendment Effective Date, the Borrower may request that any Tranche B-1 Lender convert all or a portion of its Tranche B-1 Term Loans into Tranche B-2 Term Loans. Any Tranche B-1 Lender wishing to agree to such a conversion shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a duly completed Conversion Agreement. Upon the acceptance by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of such Conversion Agreement, the Tranche B-1 Term Loans of such Tranche B-1 Lender specified therein shall be converted into an equal principal amount of Tranche B-2 Term Loans.
(ii)
    
The initial Interest Period applicable to each Tranche B-2 Term Loan resulting from the conversion of a Tranche B-1 Term Loan pursuant to clause (i) above that is a Eurodollar Loan shall be the then-current Interest Period applicable to the Tranche B-1 Term Loan from which it is converted with no conversion into a different Interest Period, payment or prepayment of such Tranche B-1 Term Loan being deemed to have occurred solely due to such conversion.
(iii)
    
On a quarterly basis, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of the aggregate amount of Tranche B-1 Term Loans that have been
61
converted into Tranche B-2 Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.01(k) during the preceding quarter.

. Loans and Borrowings.
(a) Each Revolving Loan and Term Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans of the same Class and Type made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments of the applicable Class. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder;
provided
that the Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lenders failure to make Loans as required.
(b)
    
Subject to Section 2.13, each Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans as the Borrower may request in accordance herewith. Each Lender at its option may make any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan;
provided
that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(c)

provided
that an ABR Revolving Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the total Revolving Commitments or that is required to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.04(e). Borrowings of more than one Type and Class may be outstanding at the same time;
provided
that there shall not at any time be more than a total of 20 Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding (or, if any Incremental Loans are outstanding, 30).
(d)
    
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue, any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect to the applicable Loan would end after the Revolving Maturity Date, Tranche A-2 Maturity Date, Tranche A-3 Maturity Date, Tranche A-4 Maturity Date, Tranche B-1 Maturity Date, Tranche B-2 Maturity Date or Tranche B-3 Maturity Date, as applicable.

Promptly upon the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or amendment, renewal, extension or termination of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Issuing Bank shall provide notice of such issuance, amendment, renewal, extension or termination to the Administrative Agent (if different from the Issuing Bank), who shall in turn promptly provide notice of same to the Revolving Lenders.
(c)    
Expiration Date
. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Maturity Date with respect to 2015 Revolving Loans;

Participations
. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank thereof or any of the Lenders, such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lenders Revolving Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, such Lenders Revolving Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
(e)

provided
that, if such LC Disbursement is not less than $1,000,000, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrowers obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due (or if any such reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason), the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lenders Revolving Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Revolving Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.05 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.05 shall apply,
mutatis mutandis
, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the
65
Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
(f)    
Obligations Absolute
. Except as provided below, the Borrowers obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the applicable Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrowers obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the applicable Issuing Bank;
provided
that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that (i) are caused by such Issuing Banks gross negligence or willful misconduct in determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit issued by it comply with the terms thereof, or (ii) result from such Issuing Banks willful or grossly negligent failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank thereof may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of
66
Credit, and any such acceptance or refusal shall be deemed not to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct.
(g)    
Disbursement Procedures
. Each Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit issued by it. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder;
provided
that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section.
(h)    
Interim Interest
. If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans;
provided
that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.12(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
(i)    
Replacement of an Issuing Bank
. Any Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term Issuing Bank shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
(j)    
Cash Collateralization
. If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in its Cash Collateral Account an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon;
provided
that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such
67
deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (i) or (j) of Article 7. Such deposit shall be held by the Collateral Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations. Moneys in such account (including any earnings on amounts therein) shall be applied by the Collateral Agent to pay LC Reimbursement Obligations as they become due or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy the Secured Obligations as provided in Section 13 of the Security Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned (together with any earnings thereon) to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.
SECTION 2.05
    
. Funding of Borrowings.
(a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York City and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request;
provided
that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.04(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to Section 2.04(e) to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the applicable Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.
(b)
    
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed time of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing.
SECTION 2.06
    
. Interest Elections.
(a) Each Revolving Borrowing and Term Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing
68
Request or designated by Section 2.03 and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request or designated by Section 2.03. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.
(b)    To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery, e-mail of a pdf copy or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.
(c)    Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i)    the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
(ii)    the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii)    whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and
(iv)    if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period.
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration.
(d)    Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the relevant Class of the details thereof and of such Lenders portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e)    If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such
69
Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing.

Within 15 Business Days of delivery of such notice (or such other period as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall mutually agree upon), each applicable Revolving Lender, Term Lender or Additional Lender, as the case may be, shall notify the Administrative Agent whether it consents to such extension (which consent may be given or withheld in such Revolving Lenders, Term Lenders or Additional Lenders, as applicable, sole and absolute discretion). Any Revolving Lender, Term Lender or Additional Lender, as applicable, not responding within the above time period shall be deemed not to have consented to such extension. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the applicable Revolving Lenders, Term Lenders and/or the Additional Lenders of such Revolving Lenders, Term Lenders or the Additional Lenders responses, as applicable.
(ii)

If so extended, (i) the scheduled maturity date with respect to the Revolving Commitments or Other Revolving Commitments held by the Extending Revolving Lenders shall be extended to the date specified in the notice referred to in Section 2.07(d)(i) above, which shall become the new maturity date of the Revolving Commitments or Other Revolving Commitments (such maturity date
71
for the Revolving Commitments or Other Revolving Commitments, so affected, the 
Extended Revolving Maturity Date

Revolver Extension Effective Date
), the Existing Revolving Loan Maturity Date applicable to the Non-Extending Revolving Lenders, and the Extended Revolving Maturity Date (after giving effect to such extension) applicable to the Extending Revolving Lenders, (y) the applicable Extending Term Lenders and Non-Extending Term Lenders such extension, specifying the effective date of such extension (the 
Term Loan Extension Effective Date
), the Existing Term Loan Maturity Date applicable to the Non-Extending Term Lenders, and the Extended Term Loan Maturity Date (after giving effect to such extension) applicable to the Extending Term Lenders and (z) the applicable Extending Term Lenders and/or the Extending Revolving Lenders and Non-Extending Term Lenders and/or the Non-Extending Revolving Lenders such extension, specifying the effective date of such extension (the 
Incremental Loan Extension Effective Date
), the Existing Incremental Loan Maturity Date applicable to such Non-Extending Revolving Lenders and/or Non-Extending Revolving Term Lenders, as applicable, and the Extended Incremental Loan Maturity Date (after giving effect to such extension) applicable to the Extending Term Lenders and/or the Extending Revolving Lenders, as applicable. The interest margins and/or floors with respect to any Revolving Commitments, Other Revolving Commitments, Term Loans, Other Term Loans or Incremental Loans, as applicable, extended pursuant to this Section 2.07 may be different than the interest margins and/or floors for the existing Revolving Commitments, Other Revolving Commitments, existing Class of Term Loans, Other Term Loans or Incremental Loans, as applicable, and upfront fees may be paid to the Extending Revolving Lenders or Extending Term Lenders, as applicable, in each case to the extent provided in the Borrowers notice or as otherwise agreed between the Borrower and the Extending Revolving Lenders or Extending Term Lenders, as applicable.

(iv)
    
Notwithstanding the terms of Section 9.02, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled (without the consent of any other Lenders except to the extent required under subsection (ii) above) to enter into any amendments to this Agreement that the Administrative Agent believes are necessary to appropriately reflect, or provide for the integration of, any extension of a maturity date applicable to the Revolving Commitments, Other Revolving Commitments, the maturity date applicable to any Class of Term Loans or Other
73
Term Loans or maturity date applicable to any Incremental Loans, as applicable, pursuant to this Section 2.07(d). In addition, with the consent of each Issuing Bank, participations in Letters of Credit expiring on or after the Existing Revolving Maturity Date shall be reallocated from Non-Extending Revolving Lenders to Extending Revolving Lenders in accordance with the terms of such amendment;
provided
, however, that such participation interests shall, upon receipt thereof by the Extending Revolving Lenders, be deemed to be participation interests in respect of such extended revolving commitments and the terms of such participation interests (including, without limitation, the commission applicable thereto) shall be adjusted accordingly.
(v)
    
In connection with any extension of the maturity date of the Tranche B-2 Loans on or prior to September 1, 2015, if the aggregate amount of Tranche B-2 Loans with a maturity date of December 17, 2015 outstanding after giving effect to such extension shall be equal to or less than $300,000,000, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent on the applicable Term Loan Extension Effective Date (which shall be on or prior to September 1, 2015), a certificate signed by a Financial Officer certifying as to (x) the aggregate amount of Tranche B-2 Loans outstanding with a maturity date of December 17, 2015 as of the applicable Term Loan Extension Effective Date and (y) the non-satisfaction of the Maturity Acceleration Condition, which delivery of such certificate shall satisfy the Borrowers obligations under Section 5.01(g).

The Borrower agrees to pay (zz) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender) a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Revolving Loans of such Revolving Lender on the average daily amount of such Lenders LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lenders Revolving Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to each Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.25% per annum on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) with respect to each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Revolving Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure with respect to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, as well as such Issuing Banks standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date;
provided
that all such fees shall be payable to the applicable Revolving Lenders on the date on which the Revolving Commitments of such Revolving Lenders terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Revolving Commitments of such Revolving Lenders terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to any Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
(c)
    
The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account and the account of the Collateral Agent, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Borrower such Agents.
(d)
    
All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to each Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of commitment fees and participation fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
SECTION 2.12
    
. Interest.
(a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing of each Class shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate for such Class.
(b)
    
The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing of each Class shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate for such Class.
(c)
    
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a
81
rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of any principal of any Loan or any LC Disbursements, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan or LC Disbursement as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other overdue amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.
(d)
    
Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans, upon termination of the Revolving Commitments;
provided
that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Revolving Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.
(e)
    
All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
SECTION 2.13
    
. Alternate Rate of Interest.
If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:
(a)
    
the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or
(b)
    
the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.
SECTION 2.14
    
. Increased Costs.
(a) Except with respect to Taxes, which shall be governed by Section 2.16, if any Change in Law shall:
82
(i)
    
impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or any Issuing Bank; or
(ii)
    
impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered;
provided
that such amounts shall be proportionate to the amounts that such Lender or Issuing Bank charges other borrowers or account parties for such additional costs incurred or reductions suffered on loans or letters of credit, as the case may be, similarly situated to the Borrower in connection with substantially similar facilities.
(b)
    
If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or Issuing Banks capital or on the capital of such Lenders or Issuing Banks holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lenders or Issuing Banks holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or Issuing Banks policies and the policies of such Lenders or Issuing Banks holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lenders or Issuing Banks holding company for any such reduction suffered;
provided
that such amounts shall be proportionate to the amounts that such Lender or Issuing Bank charges other borrowers or account parties for such reductions suffered on loans or letters of credit, as the case may be, similarly situated to the Borrower in connection with substantially similar facilities.
(c)
    
A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof.
(d)
    
Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or
83
Issuing Banks right to demand such compensation;
provided
that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders or Issuing Banks intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided further
that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
SECTION 2.15
    
. Break Funding Payments.
In the event of (a) the payment by or on behalf of the Borrower of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (c) the failure by the Borrower to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.10(h) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18 or Section 9.02(c), then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
SECTION 2.16
    
. Taxes.
(a) Except as required by applicable law, any and all payments by or with respect to any obligation of the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes;
provided
that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) any Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
84
(b)
    
In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c)
    
To the extent not paid by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.16(a), the Borrower shall indemnify each Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank, within 10 Business Days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by such Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or with respect to any obligation of the Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A copy of a receipt or any other document evidencing payment that is reasonably acceptable to Borrower as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by, an Agent, a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of an Agent, a Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d)
    
As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e)
    
(i) Each Recipient that is a U.S. person as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and if applicable, the assigning Lender (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased) on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of (i) a Participant, on or before the date on which such Participant purchases the related participation and (ii) an assignee, on or before the effective date of such assignment), two duly completed and signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9. Each Recipient that is not a U.S. person as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a 
Foreign Recipient
) shall, to the extent it is legally able to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and if applicable, the assigning Lender (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased) on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of (x) a Participant, on or before the date on which such Participant purchases the related participation and (y) an assignee, on or before the effective date of such assignment) either:
(A)
    
two copies of a duly completed and signed Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN (with respect to eligibility for benefits under any income tax treaty) or Form W-8IMY or successor and related applicable forms, as the case may be, certifying to such Foreign Recipients entitlement as of such date to an exemption from or reduction of United States withholding tax with respect to payments to be made under this Agreement, or
85
(B)
    
in the case of a Foreign Recipient that is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code and that does not comply with the requirements of clause (A) hereof, (x) a statement in form and content reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower to the effect that such Foreign Recipient is eligible for a complete exemption from withholding of U.S. Taxes under Code section 871(h) or 881(c) (a 
Foreign Recipient Complete Exemption Certificate
), and (y) two duly completed and signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or any successor and related applicable form.
Further, each Foreign Recipient agrees, (i) to the extent it is not precluded from doing so by a Change in Law and otherwise legally able to do so, to deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and if applicable, the assigning Lender (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased), from time to time, two copies of a duly completed and signed applicable Form W-8 or successor and related applicable forms or certificates, on or before the date that any such form or certificate, as the case may be, expires or becomes obsolete or invalid in accordance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations, (ii) in the case of a Foreign Recipient that delivers a Foreign Recipient Complete Exemption Certificate, to deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and if applicable, the assigning Lender (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased), such statement on an annual basis reasonably promptly after the anniversary of the date on which such Foreign Recipient became a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of a Participant, the date on which the Participant purchased the related participation), and (iii) to notify promptly the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased) if it is no longer able to deliver, or if it is required to withdraw or cancel, any form or certificate previously delivered by it pursuant to this Section 2.16(e).
(ii)
    
In addition, but without duplication of the covenant as to United States withholding tax contained in Section 2.16(e)(i), any Recipient that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction(s) in which the Borrower is organized, or any treaty to which any such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.
(f)
    
If a payment made to any Agent, Lender, or Issuing Bank hereunder would be subject to United States federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Agent, Lender, or Issuing Bank were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Agent, Lender, or Issuing Bank shall deliver to the Borrower at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by
86
Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower as may be necessary for the Borrower to comply with its obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank has complied with such Agents, Lenders or Issuing Banks obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.
(g)
    
If any Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank determines, in its discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund);
provided
that the Borrower, upon the request of such Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to such Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank in the event such Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the any Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
SECTION 2.17
    
. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
(a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) no later than 2:00 pm, New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent to the applicable account designated to the Borrower, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16 and Section 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments made pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.
(b)
    
If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder (after giving effect to all applicable grace periods and/or cure periods, if any), such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled
87
thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
(c)
    
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements;
provided
that (xxx) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to any Wireline Company or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply except as provided in clause (ii) of this Section 2.17(c)). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
(d)
    
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of any of the Lenders or any Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to such Lenders or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
(e)
    
If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(d) or (e), 2.05(a) or (b), 2.17(d) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the
88
account of such Lender to satisfy such Lenders obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
SECTION 2.18
    
. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (aii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b)
    
If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, or (ii) any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder (any Lender described in this clause (ii), a 
Defaulting Lender
), then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);
provided
that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and if a Revolving Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Banks), which consents shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and funded participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts), (iii) the Borrower, the Defaulting Lender (if any) or such assignee shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the processing and recordation fee specified in Section 9.04(b) and (iv) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
SECTION 2.19
    
. Refinancing Amendments.
(a) The Borrower may obtain, from any Lender or any Additional Lender, Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness (x) in the form of Other Term Loans or Other Term Commitments or (y) Other Revolving Loans or Other Revolving Commitments, in each case, to refinance all or any portion of the Loans and Commitments hereunder (which for this purpose will be deemed to include any then outstanding Other Revolving Commitments, Other Revolving Loans and/or Other Term Loans), pursuant to a
89
Refinancing Amendment;
provided
that such Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness (i) will rank pari passu in right of payment and of security with the other Loans and Commitments hereunder, (ii) will have such pricing, fees (including upfront fees and OID), optional prepayment terms, redemption premiums and subordination terms as may be agreed by the Borrower and the Lenders thereof, (iii) (x) with respect to any Other Term Loans or Other Term Commitments, will have a maturity date that is not prior to the maturity date of the Class of Term Loans or Revolving Commitments being refinanced, and will have a Weighted Average Life to Maturity that is not shorter than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Class of Term Loans being refinanced (if applicable) and (y) with respect to any Other Revolving Loans or Other Revolving Commitments, will have a maturity date that is not prior to the maturity date with respect to the Class of Revolving Commitments or Class of Term Loans being refinanced and (iv) except as otherwise permitted herein, will have terms and conditions taken as a whole that are substantially identical to, or no more favorable to the Lenders providing such Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness than, the Refinanced Debt;
provided
further that (x) the terms and conditions applicable to such Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness may provide for any additional or different financial or other covenants or other provisions that are agreed between the Borrower and the Lenders thereof and applicable only during periods after the Latest Maturity Date that is in effect on the date such Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness is incurred or obtained and (y) the effectiveness of any Refinancing Amendment, together with the effectiveness of any increase in Revolving Commitments, shall not result in there being more than four separate Maturity Dates in effect for all Revolving Commitments. The effectiveness of any Refinancing Amendment shall be subject to the satisfaction on the date thereof of each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.03(a) and (b) (it being understood that all references to the date of such Credit Event or similar language in Section 4.03(a) and (b) shall be deemed to refer to the effective date of such Refinancing Amendment). Each Class of Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness incurred under this Section 2.19 shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is not less than $50,000,000 and an integral multiple of $5,000,000 in excess thereof. Any Refinancing Amendment may provide for the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of the Borrower, pursuant to any Other Revolving Commitments established thereby, on terms substantially equivalent to the terms applicable to Letters of Credit under the Revolving Commitments hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Refinancing Amendment. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of any Refinancing Amendment, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness incurred pursuant thereto (including any amendments necessary to treat the Loans and Commitments subject thereto as Other Term Loans, Other Revolving Loans, Other Revolving Commitments and/or Other Term Commitments). Any Refinancing Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.19. In addition, if so provided in the relevant Refinancing Amendment and with the consent of each Issuing Bank, participations in Letters of Credit expiring on or after
90
the Revolving Maturity Date shall be reallocated from Lenders holding Revolving Commitments hereunder to Lenders holding extended revolving commitments in accordance with the terms of such Refinancing Amendment;
provided
, however, that such participation interests shall, upon receipt thereof by the relevant Lenders holding such extended revolving commitments, be deemed to be participation interests in respect of such extended revolving commitments and the terms of such participation interests (including, without limitation, the commission applicable thereto) shall be adjusted accordingly.
(b)
    
This Section 2.19 shall supercede any provisions in Section 2.17 or 9.02 to the contrary.

ARTICLE 8
THE AGENTS
Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably appoints each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent as its agent and authorizes (i) the Collateral Agent to sign and deliver the Security Documents and (ii) each such Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to such Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Any bank serving as an Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with any Wireline Company or Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent.
No Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) no Agent shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) no Agent shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that such Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, no Agent shall have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any Wireline Company that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as an Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. No Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to such Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and no Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into any statement, warranty or
123
representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth any Loan Document, the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 4 or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. Each Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for any Wireline Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
Any Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by such Agent. Any Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of any Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the Facilities as well as activities as an Agent.
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, as provided in this paragraph, each of the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower (which may not be unreasonably withheld), to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Borrower
124
and such successor.

Section 9.02
    
. Waivers; Amendments.
(a) No failure or delay by any Lender Party in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Lender Parties under the Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether any Lender Party may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. No notice or demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
(b)
    
Except as provided in Section 2.01(i) with respect to any Incremental Facility Amendment, no Loan Document or any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of any Security Document, the Collateral Agent) with the consent of the Required Lenders;
provided
that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce or forgive the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon (other than any waiver of default interest payable pursuant to Section 2.12(c)), or reduce or forgive any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender Party directly affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date
126
of repayment of the principal amount of any Loan pursuant to Section 2.08 or 2.09 or the applicable Incremental Facility Amendment or the required date of reimbursement of any LC Disbursement, or any interest (other than any waiver of default interest) or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce (other than any waiver of default interest) the amount of, waive or excuse any such repayment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (iv) change the rights of the Tranche B-1 Lenders to decline mandatory prepayments as provided in Section 2.10, without the written consent of Lenders holding a majority of the outstanding Tranche B-1 Term Loans, (v) change Section 2.17(b) or (c), the penultimate sentence of Section 2.10(i), or the last sentence of Section 2.07(c), in each case in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments or reduction of Commitments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender adversely affected thereby (it being understood that an amendment shall not be deemed to change such provisions in such manner to the extent it effects an increase in the commitment of any Lender(s) or in the aggregate amount of the commitments of any class), (vi) change any of the provisions of this Section or reduce the percentage set forth in the definition of Required Lenders (or the definition of Required Revolving Lenders or Required Tranche A-3 Lenders) or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders (or Lenders of any Class) required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender, or each Lender of such Class, as the case may be (it being understood that an amendment shall not be deemed to change such provisions to the extent it effects an increase in the commitment of any Lender(s) or in the aggregate amount of the commitments of any class), (vii) release any material Guarantor from its Facility Guarantee (except as expressly provided in the Guarantee Agreement), or limit its liability in respect of its Facility Guarantee, without the written consent of each Lender, (viii) release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Transaction Liens, without the written consent of each Lender, (ix) waive any condition set forth in Section 4.03 (including by amending or waiving any provision of Article 3, 5, 6 or 7 if the effect of such amendment or waiver would be to waive any such condition) for purposes of any Revolving Borrowing without the written consent of the Required Revolving Lenders, (x) change any provision of any Loan Document in a manner that by its terms adversely affects the rights in respect of payments due to Lenders holding Loans of any Class differently than those holding Loans of any other Class, without the written consent of Lenders holding a majority in interest of the outstanding Loans and unused Commitments of each adversely affected Class, (xi) modify the protections afforded to an SPV pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.04(e) without the prior written consent of such SPV, (xii) amend the definition of Interest Period so as to permit any Interest Period of greater than 6 months without the consent of all Lenders participating in the applicable Borrowing, without the written consent of each such Lender or (xiii) change the rights of the Tranche B-2 Lenders to decline mandatory prepayments as provided in Section 2.10, without the written consent of Lenders holding a majority of the outstanding Tranche B-2 Term Loans;
provided further
that (A) no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Issuing Bank under the Loan Documents without the prior written consent of such Agent or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, (B) any waiver, amendment or modification of this Agreement that by its terms affects the rights or duties under this Agreement of one Class of Lenders (but not of any other Class of Lenders) may be effected by an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the
127
requisite percentage in interest of the affected Class of Lenders that would be required to consent thereto under this Section if such Class of Lenders were the only Class of Lenders hereunder at the time and any waiver, amendment or modification of the Commitment Letter or either Fee Letter may be effected by an agreement or agreements in writing entered into only by the parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (as provided in the definitions of Required Lenders, Required Revolving Lenders and Required Tranche A-3 Lenders), except that the Commitment of such Lender may not be increased or extended without its consent.
(c)
    
In connection with any proposed amendment, modification, waiver or termination (a 
Proposed Change
) requiring the consent of all Lenders or all affected Lenders, if the consent of the Required Lenders (and/or, to the extent so required, the consent of the Required Revolving Lenders, the Required Tranche A-3 Lenders or the Required Tranche A-4 Lenders, as applicable) to such Proposed Change is obtained, but the consent to such Proposed Change of other Lenders whose consent is required is not obtained (any such Lender whose consent is not obtained as described in paragraph (b) of this Section being referred to as a 
Non-Consenting Lender
), then, so long as the Lender that is acting as Administrative Agent is not a Non-Consenting Lender, the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Non-Consenting Lender and the Administrative Agent, require each of the Non-Consenting Lenders to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment),
provided
that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Revolving Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank), which consent(s) shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, (ii) each Non-Consenting Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts), (iii) the Borrower or such assignee shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the processing and recordation fee specified in Section 9.04(b), (iv) if the Proposed Change is a decrease in the Applicable Rate with respect to Tranche B-1 Term Loans, each Tranche B-1 Lender shall have received the Optional Prepayment Premium on such Tranche B-1 Lenders Tranche B-1 Term Loans, without regard to whether such Tranche B-1 Lenders Tranche B-1 Term Loans are being assigned pursuant to this Section 9.02(c) and (v) if the consent, amendment or waiver in question contemplates a Repricing Transaction in respect of any Tranche B-3 Term Loans held by such Non-Consenting Lender, the Borrower shall pay the Prepayment Fee (if any) required pursuant to Section 2.10(g) as if the outstanding Tranche B-3 Term Loans of such Non-Consenting Lender were prepaid or repriced in their entirety in connection with a Repricing Transaction on the date of the consummation of such assignment. For the avoidance of doubt, any replacement of Lenders in connection with the extension of the maturity date of any Class of Loans shall be governed by Section 2.07(d).
128
(d)
    
Further, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, if following the Fourth ARCA Effective Date, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall have jointly identified an obvious error or any error or omission of a technical or immaterial nature, in each case, in any provision of the Loan Documents then the Administrative Agent (acting in its sole discretion) and the Borrower shall be permitted to amend such provision and such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to any Loan Document if the same is not objected to in writing by the Required Lenders within five Business Days following receipt of notice thereof.
Section 9.03
    
. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.
(a) The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lead Arrangers and their Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of Davis Polk & Wardwell and Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, special New York and regulatory counsel, respectively, for the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lead Arrangers, in connection with the syndication of the Facilities and the preparation of the Loan Documents (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), all reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lead Arrangers and their Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lead Arrangers in connection with the administration of the Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing Banks in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit by it or any demand for payment thereunder and all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any Lender Party, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Lender Party, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with the Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such out-of pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.
(b)
    
The Borrower shall indemnify each of the Lender Parties, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an 
Indemnitee
), against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, but excluding Taxes, which are governed by Section 2.16, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by an Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on
129
or from any property currently or formerly owned or operated by any Wireline Company, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to any of the Wireline Companies, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto;
provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, any claims of such Indemnitee against any other Indemnitee and/or the breach by such Indemnitee of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document.
(c)
    
To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to any Agent or any Issuing Bank under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to such Agent or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such Lenders pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought based on the aggregate amount of (x) in the case of a payment owed to an Agent, the Revolving Commitments and outstanding Term Loans and (y) in the case of a payment owed to an Issuing Bank, the Revolving Commitments) of such unpaid amount;
provided
that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the applicable Agent or Issuing Bank in its capacity as such.
(d)
    
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.
(e)
    
All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than ten Business Days after written demand therefor.
Section 9.04
    
. Successors and Assigns.
(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of an Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of any Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the other Agents and the Related Parties of each of the Agents, the Issuing Banks and

(A)
    
the Borrower,
provided
that (x) no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee and (y) such consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
(B)
    
the Administrative Agent,
provided
that, in the case of an assignment of any Term Loan or Term Commitment, (x) no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for such assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund and (y) such consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and

except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment or Loans of any Class, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 or, in the case of a Term Loan, $1,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent
provided
that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;
(B)
    
each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement,
provided
that this clause shall not be construed to prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations in respect of one Class of Commitments or Loans;
(C)
    
the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500;
provided
that
131
assignments made pursuant to Section 2.18(b) shall not require the signature of the assigning Lender to become effective;
(D)
    
the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire in which the assignee designates one or more Credit Contacts to whom all syndicate-level information (which may contain material non-public information about the Borrower, the other Loan Parties and their Related Parties or their respective subsidiaries) will be made available and who may receive such information in accordance with the assignees compliance procedures and applicable laws, including Federal and state securities laws; and
(E)
    
in the case of an assignment of Loans to the Borrower, the Borrower shall be deemed to be excluded from the definition of Lender for the purposes of Section 9.02.
For the purposes of this Section 9.04(b), the term

 and 
CLO

Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.
(iv)
    
The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and
132
Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the 
Register
). Absent manifest error, the entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Banks and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(v)
    
Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignees completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register;
provided
that if either the assigning Lender or the assignee shall have failed to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(d) or (e), 2.05(b), 2.17(d) or 9.03(c), the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information therein in the Register unless and until such payment shall have been made in full, together with all accrued interest thereon. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
(vi)
    
The words execution, signed, signature and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
(c)
    
(i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a 
Participant
) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it);
provided
that (A) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower and the other Lenders Parties shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents;
provided
that such
133
agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.17(c) as though it were a Lender.
(ii)
    
A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.14 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers prior written consent. A Participant that is a Foreign Recipient shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Participant complies with Section 2.16(e).
(d)
    
Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;
provided
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
(e)
    
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a 
Granting Lender
) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle organized and administered by such Granting Lender (an 
SPV
), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement,
provided
that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to make any Loan, (ii) if an SPV elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof and (iii) the SPV shall provide the documentation described in Section 2.16(e) and shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.14 or 2.16 than the Granting Lender would be entitled to receive thereunder. The making of a Loan by an SPV hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPV, such party will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPV any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof;
provided
that each Lender designating any SPV hereby agrees to
134
indemnify and hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage or expense arising out of its inability to institute such a proceeding against such SPV during such period of forbearance. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.04, any SPV may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by the Borrower and Administrative Agent) providing liquidity or credit support to or for the account of such SPV to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPV.
Section 9.05
    
. Survival.
All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to the Loan Documents shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that any Lender Party may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 and Article 8 shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
Section 9.06
