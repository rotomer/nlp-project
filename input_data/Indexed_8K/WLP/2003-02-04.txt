(NYSE: ATH) today reported that net income for the fourth quarter of 2002 increased 96 percent, to $171.9 million, or $1.19 per share, compared with net income of $87.7 million, or $0.85 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2001. Excluding net realized gains and other non-recurring items in both periods, and on a FAS 142 comparable basis, net income for the fourth quarter of 2002 increased 57% to $160.9 million, or $1.12 per share, compared with net income of $102.7 million, or $0.99 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2001. Net income for full year 2002 increased 60 percent, to $549.1 million, or $4.51 per share, compared with net income of $342.2 million, or $3.30 per share, in 2001. Excluding net realized gains and other non-recurring items in both periods, and on a FAS 142 comparable basis, net income for full year 2002 increased 53% to $502.1 million, or $4.12 per share, compared with $329.2 million, or $3.17 per share, in 2001. "As I look back at the objectives we established for 2002, I am pleased to report that solid execution by all of our business units resulted in performance exceeding our own expectations for the year. In our first full year as a public company we have been able to demonstrate that adherence to a sound business strategy which focuses on the needs of our customers allows us to produce value both for our customers and for our shareholders," said Larry C. Glasscock, president and chief executive officer of Anthem, Inc. "We believe our continued membership growth and strong customer retention results from our ability to respond to market demands with new products and distinctive service," added Glasscock. Consolidated Highlights .. Membership: Medical enrollment reached almost 11.1 million members at December 31, 2002, representing a 40 percent increase compared with 2001, or 8 percent excluding the acquisition of Trigon. In addition to membership growth from the acquisition, enrollment gains were primarily due to growth in National Accounts and Individual businesses, coupled with strong membership retention in all segments. 1
.. Operating Revenue: Operating revenue increased 50 percent in the fourth quarter, to $3.9 billion, compared with the fourth quarter of 2001. The growth was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Trigon, disciplined pricing, and solid membership growth across each line of business. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, operating revenue grew by 16 percent, to $3.0 billion, in the fourth quarter. Operating revenue reached $13.0 billion for the full year 2002. .. Operating Margin: Operating margin of 5.8 percent in the fourth quarter was another record for the company, as operating gain increased 111 percent, to $225.8 million, compared with the fourth quarter of 2001. All core operating segments contributed positively to the earnings growth for the quarter. Excluding results from the Trigon acquisition, operating margin reached 5.2 percent and operating gain increased 46 percent over the prior year's fourth quarter. For the full year 2002, operating margin reached 5.0 percent, or 4.6 percent, excluding results from the Trigon acquisition. Results in both periods were driven primarily by disciplined pricing, lower than anticipated medical costs, and profitable enrollment growth, with Local Large Group, Small Group, and Individual businesses contributing most significantly to the earnings improvement. .. Benefit Expense: The benefit expense ratio improved by 180 basis points in the fourth quarter, to 80.9 percent, compared with 82.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2001. The improvement was primarily due to lower than anticipated medical cost trends. For full year 2002 the ratio improved by 210 basis points, to 82.4 percent. .. Price and Cost Trends: Commercial premium yields increased by approximately 14 percent, while commercial medical costs increased by approximately 12 percent during the 12-month period ended December 31, 2002. Medical costs were driven primarily by increased member utilization of physician services and outpatient facility care. .. Administrative Expense: The administrative expense ratio in the fourth quarter was 19.8 percent, compared with 20.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2001. The 30 basis point improvement reflected disciplined focus on optimizing administrative expenses over a larger membership base. Partially offsetting this improvement was higher incentive compensation associated with above targeted results, reclassified expenses associated with a service contract of AdminaStar Federal, and expenses associated with the dissolution of a small Midwest-based joint venture. Excluding these three items, totaling $36.7 million, the ratio was 18.9 percent, a 120 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2001. .. For the full year 2002, the administrative expense ratio was 19.3 percent, an improvement of 30 basis points compared with 19.6 percent in 2001. The ratio improved by 120 basis points, to 18.4 percent, in 2002, excluding certain items totaling $126.9 million. These items included additional premium tax expenses in the state of Ohio and a reduction in the carrying value of the Company's investment in MedUnite, which were reported in the third quarter of 2002, as well as the items described above for the fourth quarter of 2002. .. Cash Flow: Cash flow from operations reached $367.2 million in the quarter. Cash flow for full year 2002 was $991.1 million, or 1.8 times net income. .. Days in Claims Payable: Days in claims payable declined by 4.0 days, to 57.0 days, compared with September 30, 2002. Approximately half of the decline was associated with a reclass from incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves to other policyholder liabilities for certain case-specific reserves. The remaining decline was driven primarily by lower than anticipated medical cost trends and system improvements that have led to more efficient claims processing. Additionally, providers have increased their utilization of electronic claim filing, which has contributed to faster adjudication of claims. Additional information illustrating the adequacy of reserves has been provided on page 8 of this release. 2
.. Share Repurchase Program: During the quarter, 2.4 million shares were repurchased for $147 million at an average price of $61.27. During 2002, a total of 4.1 million shares were repurchased for $256 million at an average price of $62.17. .. On January 27, 2003, Anthem's Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the investment of up to $500 million to purchase additional shares, subject to business and market conditions, over a two-year period. Operating Segment Highlights - Fourth Quarter 2002 Midwest Segment Highlights The Midwest segment is comprised of health benefit and related business for members in Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. .. Operating gain was more than double the prior year's fourth quarter. The improvement was driven primarily by disciplined pricing and lower than anticipated medical costs. Small Group and Individual businesses contributed most significantly to the growth in earnings. .. Enrollment increased by 380,000 members, or 8 percent, compared with December 31, 2001, primarily due to membership gains in National and Individual businesses. East Segment Highlights The East segment is comprised of health benefit and related business for members in Connecticut, New Hampshire and Maine. .. Operating gain improved 32 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2001, as the segment reached another record-high operating margin, at 6.0 percent. The improvement was primarily driven by disciplined pricing and particularly strong results in Individual business. 3
.. Membership increased by 8 percent since December 31, 2001, primarily due to growth in National Accounts. West Segment Highlights The West segment is comprised of health benefit and related business for members in Colorado and Nevada. .. Operating gain improved by $15.6 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2001. The increase was primarily due to pricing discipline and lower than anticipated medical costs. The Local Large Group business contributed most significantly to the growth in earnings. .. Membership increased 9 percent compared with December 31, 2001, primarily due to growth in National Accounts and Individual businesses. Southeast Segment Highlights On July 31, 2002 Anthem acquired Trigon Healthcare, Inc., establishing a new geographic segment, the Southeast. The results of operations since its purchase are included in consolidated results. The Southeast segment is comprised of health benefit and related business for members in Virginia, excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C. *Represents pre-merger results, reclassified to Anthem's presentation format, which are shown for comparative purposes only. .. If Anthem had owned Trigon for the three months ended December 2001, operating gain in the fourth quarter of 2002 would have represented a 93 percent improvement over results for the prior year's fourth quarter. On the same basis, operating margin would have improved by 320 basis points, compared with 4.6 percent in the prior year. The combination of disciplined pricing and lower than anticipated medical costs contributed to the growth in operating gain. Small and Local Large Group businesses contributed most significantly to the improvement. .. Including the seven months prior to the acquisition, enrollment increased by 6 percent, driven largely by growth in National Accounts. 4
Specialty Segment Highlights The Specialty segment includes pharmacy benefit management, group life, dental, behavioral health, and vision operations of the company. .. Operating gain increased 53 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2001, primarily due to increased mail order prescription volume and margin expansion from increased generic drug penetration at Anthem Prescription Management (APM). Improved results in the life businesses also contributed to the growth, which was modestly offset by start-up and integration expenses associated with the behavioral health, vision and dental operations. .. Mail order prescription volume exceeded 636,500 scripts, increasing 24 percent compared with the prior year's quarter. .. APM membership exceeded 4.7 million at December 31, 2002, a 14 percent increase over 2001. Other Segment Highlights The Other segment includes AdminaStar Federal, a subsidiary that administers Medicare programs, and Anthem Alliance, a subsidiary that provided health benefits and administration for retired military enrollees and their dependents in the TRICARE program, until the TRICARE operations were sold on May 31, 2001. The segment also includes inter-segment revenue and expense eliminations and corporate expenses not allocated to operating segments. .. Operating loss was higher in the fourth quarter of 2002 compared with the same period in 2001, primarily due to higher unallocated technology and corporate office expenses, including the higher incentive compensation expenses associated with above targeted results. Earnings Outlook .. Anthem raised its adjusted earnings expectations for full year 2003 to $4.75 to $4.85 per share, from $4.65 to $4.75 per share, based on 143 to 145 million weighted average shares. .. The Company's earnings in the first quarter of 2003 are expected to reach $1.00 to $1.05 per share based on 142 to 144 million weighted average shares. These results are expected to reflect normal seasonality compared with fourth quarter 2002 results. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5
Anthem's Basis of Presentation 1. All earnings per share amounts are on a diluted basis. 2. Earnings per share calculations for the current quarter were based on 144.2 million diluted shares. 3. Adjusted earnings are defined as net income, excluding realized gains or losses on investments and other non-recurring items identified on the financial statements. 4. Adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2002 increased to $1.12, excluding $0.07 per share for realized gains on investments. These results increased 13 percent compared with adjusted earnings of $0.99 per share in the prior year's fourth quarter. Last year's adjusted earnings of $0.99 per share excluded $0.10 per share for demutualization expenses, and $0.04 per share for goodwill amortization that is not expensed after December 31, 2001, in accordance with FAS 142. Refer to the financial statements for a reconciliation of these adjustments. 5. Adjusted earnings per share for full year 2002 increased to $4.12, excluding $0.17 per share for realized gains on investments and $0.22 in favorable non-recurring federal income tax benefits associated with a reduction in the Company's tax valuation allowance during third quarter. These results increased 30 percent compared with adjusted earnings of $3.17 per share in 2001. Last year's earnings of $3.17 per share excluded $0.38 per share for realized gains on investments, $0.16 per share for the gain on sale of our TRICARE operations, $0.27 per share for demutualization expenses, and $0.14 per share for goodwill amortization that is not expensed after December 31, 2001, in accordance with FAS 142. Refer to the financial statements for a reconciliation of these adjustments. 6. Operating revenue is defined as premiums plus administrative fees and other revenue. 7. Operating revenue and premium equivalents is a measure of the volume of business commonly used in the health benefits industry to allow for a comparison of operating efficiency among companies. It is obtained by adding to premiums, administrative fees, other revenue and the amount of claims attributable to non-Medicare, self-funded health business where we provide a complete array of customers service, claims administration and billing and enrollment services. 8. Operating gain is defined as operating revenue less benefit expense and administrative expense. Net investment income, net realized gains on investments, interest expense, amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, demutualization expenses, gain/loss on the sale of subsidiary operations, income tax expense, and minority interest are not included. 9. Consistent with Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", goodwill has not been amortized as an expense after December 31, 2001. 10. On July 31, 2002 Anthem acquired Trigon Healthcare, Inc., creating a new Southeast segment. Results of operations since the purchase date have been included in consolidated results. 11. Historical financial results and membership for the Southeast segment have been reclassified into a reporting format consistent with Anthem's presentation style and can be found at www.anthem.com.
