1. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with BAS that:
 
(a) The Company meets the requirements for use of Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Act") and has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on such Form (File No. 333-101969), which has become effective, for the registration under the Act of, among other things, the Securities. Such registration statement, as amended, including the financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto, in the form in which it was declared effective by the Commission under the Act, including all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement". Any registration statement filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act is called the "Rule 462(b) Registration Statement", and from and after the date and time of filing of the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement the term "Registration Statement" shall include the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement. In addition, the Company has filed, or will file, with the Commission a final prospectus (the "Base Prospectus") and the final prospectus supplement (the "Prospectus Supplement") relating to the offering of the Securities pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act, within the applicable time period set forth therein. The term "Prospectus" means the Base Prospectus together with the Prospectus Supplement, including all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein, specifically relating to the Securities, in the form first used by the Underwriters to confirm sales of the
Securities. The term "Preliminary Prospectus" means a prospectus supplement subject to completion specifically relating to the Securities, together with the Base Prospectus. All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, a Preliminary Prospectus, or the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing, shall include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR"). All references in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is "in," "contained," "included" or "stated" in the Registration Statement, the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, a Preliminary Prospectus, or the Prospectus (and all other references of like import) shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is or is deemed to be incorporated by reference therein, as the case may be; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, a Preliminary Prospectus, or the Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include any document subsequently filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), which is or is deemed to be incorporated by reference therein, as the case may be.

The Company has complied to the Commission's satisfaction with all requests of the Commission for additional or supplemental information. No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement is in effect and no proceedings for such purpose have been instituted or are pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company, are contemplated or threatened by the Commission.

The Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, as of its date and at all subsequent times, did not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

provided
however
 
(b) BAS will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or any amendment or
 
supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by BAS expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and BAS on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and BAS on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
 
thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and BAS on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by BAS, in each case, as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or BAS on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and BAS agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), BAS shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which BAS has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
pro rata
 
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls BAS within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of BAS, and the obligations of BAS under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which BAS may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his or her consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
 
9. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and of BAS, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of BAS or any controlling person of BAS, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
 
10. If this Agreement shall be terminated and Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement by BAS or termination of this Agreement by BAS pursuant to Section 7(i), other than a termination pursuant to Section 7(i)(iii), the Company will reimburse BAS for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by BAS in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities not so delivered, but the
 
Company shall then be under no further liability to BAS except as provided in Sections 6, 7(i) and 8 hereof.
 
11. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to BAS shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to Banc of America Securities LLC, 9 West 57
th
Street, NY1-301-2M-01, New York, New York 10019, Attention: Transaction Management; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Chief Legal and Administrative Officer.

The signature of such Authorized Officer upon the Securities may be in the form of a facsimile signature of a present or any future Authorized Officer and may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Securities and for that purpose the Company may use the facsimile signature of any person who shall have been an Authorized Officer, notwithstanding the fact that at the time the Securities shall be authenticated and delivered or disposed of such person shall have ceased to be an Authorized Officer.
 
Only such Securities as shall bear thereon a Certificate of Authentication substantially in the form established for such Securities, executed manually by an authorized signatory of the Trustee, or by any Authenticating Agent with respect to such Securities, shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose. Such certificate executed by the Trustee, or by any Authenticating Agent appointed by the Trustee with respect to such Securities, upon any Security executed by the Company shall be conclusive evidence that the Security so authenticated has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and that the registered holder thereof is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
 
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities and the Trustee, in accordance with such Company Order, shall authenticate and deliver such Securities; provided, however, that in the case of Securities offered in a Periodic Offering, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver such Securities from time to time in accordance with Instructions or such other procedures acceptable to the Trustee as may be specified by or pursuant to a supplemental indenture or Company Order delivered to the Trustee prior to the time of the first authentication of Securities of such series.
 
In authenticating such Securities and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall receive and (subject to Section 7.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, (i) an Opinion of Counsel and (ii) an Officers' Certificate, each stating that the form and terms thereof have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; provided, however, that, with respect to Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive such Opinion of Counsel and Officers' Certificate only once at or prior to the time of the first authentication of Securities of such series and that, in such opinion or certificate, the opinion or certificate described above may state that when the terms of such Securities, or each Tranche thereof, shall have been established pursuant to a Company Order or Orders or pursuant to such procedures acceptable to the Trustee, as may be specified by a Company Order, such terms will have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture. Each Opinion of Counsel and Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to this Section 2.04 shall include all statements prescribed in Section 13.06(b). Such Opinion of Counsel shall also be to the effect that when such Securities have been executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture and delivered to and duly paid for by the purchasers thereof, they will be valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms (subject to customary exceptions) and will be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
 
With respect to Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the authorization by the Company of any of such Securities, the forms and terms thereof and the legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability thereof, upon the Company Order, Opinion of Counsel, Officers' Certificate and other documents delivered pursuant to this Section at or prior to the time of the first authentication of Securities of such series unless and until such Company Order, Opinion of Counsel, Officers' Certificate or other documents have been superseded or revoked or expire by their terms.
 
The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
 
SECTION 2.05. Exchanges and Transfers.
 
(a) Securities of any series may be exchanged upon presentation thereof at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose, for other Securities of such series of authorized denominations, and for a like aggregate principal amount, upon payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge in relation thereto, all as provided in this Section. In respect of any Securities so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, the Trustee shall authenticate and such office or agency shall deliver in exchange therefor the Security or Securities of the same series which the Securityholder making the exchange shall be entitled to receive, bearing numbers not contemporaneously outstanding.
 
(b) The Company shall keep, or cause to be kept, at its office or agency designated for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, the City and State of New York, or such other location designated by the Company a register or registers (herein referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall register the Securities and the transfers of Securities as in this Article provided and which at all reasonable times shall be open for inspection by the Trustee. The registrar for the purpose of registering Securities and transfer of Securities as herein provided shall be appointed as authorized by Board Resolution, an indenture supplement hereto or Company Order (the "Security Registrar").
 
Upon surrender for transfer of any Security at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, the City and State of New York, or other location as aforesaid, the Company shall execute, the Trustee shall authenticate and such office or agency shall deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Security or Securities of the same series as the Security presented for a like aggregate principal amount.
 
All Securities presented or surrendered for exchange or registration of transfer, as provided in this Section, shall be accompanied (if so required by the Company or the Security Registrar) by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company or the Security Registrar, duly executed by the registered holder or by his duly authorized attorney in writing.
 
(c) Except as provided in the first paragraph of Section 2.07, no service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer of Securities, or issue of new Securities in case of partial redemption of any series, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge in relation thereto, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 2.06, Section 3.03(b) and Section 9.04 not involving any transfer.
 
(d) The Company shall neither be required (i) to issue, exchange or
 
register the transfer of any Securities during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of less than all the outstanding Securities of the same series and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, nor (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Securities of any series or portions thereof called for redemption or as to which the holder thereof has exercised its right, if any, to require the Company to repurchase such Security in whole or in part, except that portion of such Security not required to be repurchased. The provisions of this Section 2.05 are, with respect to any Global Security, subject to Section 2.11 hereof.
 
SECTION 2.06. Temporary Securities.
 
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities (printed, lithographed or typewritten) of any authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued, but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Company. Every temporary Security of any series shall be executed by the Company and be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Securities of such series in accordance with Section 2.04. Without unnecessary delay the Company will execute and will furnish definitive Securities of such series and thereupon any or all temporary Securities of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefor (without charge to the holders thereof), at the office or agency of the Company designated for the purpose, and the Trustee shall authenticate and such office or agency shall deliver in exchange for such temporary Securities an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of such series, unless the Company advises the Trustee to the effect that definitive Securities need not be executed and furnished until further notice from the Company. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of such series shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series authenticated and delivered hereunder.
 
SECTION 2.07. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Securities.
 
In case any temporary or definitive Security shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company (subject to the next succeeding sentence) shall execute, and upon its request the Trustee (subject as aforesaid) shall authenticate and deliver, a new Security of the same series bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Security, or in lieu of and in substitution for the Security so destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substituted Security shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company and to the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of the applicant's Security and of the ownership thereof. The Trustee may authenticate any such substituted Security and deliver the same upon the written request or authorization of any officer of the Company. Upon the issuance of any substituted Security, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. In case any Security which has matured or is about to mature shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substitute
 
Security, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Security) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee such security or indemnity as they may require to save them harmless, and, in case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to the satisfaction of the Company and the Trustee of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
 
Every Security issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section in substitution for any Security which is mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be found at any time, or be enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of the same series duly issued hereunder. All Securities shall be held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities, and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) any and all other rights or remedies, notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
 
SECTION 2.08. Cancellation of Securities.
 
All Securities surrendered for the purpose of payment, redemption, exchange or registration of transfer, or for credit against a sinking fund, shall, if surrendered to the Company or any paying agent, be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be canceled by it, and no Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly required or permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. On request of the Company, the Trustee shall deliver to the Company canceled Securities held by the Trustee. In the absence of such request the Trustee may dispose of canceled Securities in accordance with its standard procedures then in effect. If the Company shall otherwise acquire any of the Securities, however, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
 
SECTION 2.09. No Third Party Rights.
 
Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, express or implied, shall give or be construed to give to any person, firm or corporation, other than the parties hereto and the holders of the Securities, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Indenture, or under any covenant, condition or provision herein contained; all such covenants, conditions and provisions being for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and of the holders of the Securities.
 
SECTION 2.10. Authenticating Agent.
 
So long as any of the Securities of any series remain outstanding there may be an Authenticating Agent for any or all such series of Securities which the Trustee shall have the right to appoint. Said Authenticating Agent shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon exchange, transfer or partial redemption thereof, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall
 
be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. All references in this Indenture to the authentication of Securities by the Trustee shall be deemed to include authentication by an Authenticating Agent for such series except for authentication upon original issuance or pursuant to Section 2.07 hereof. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall be a corporation which has a combined capital and surplus, as most recently reported or determined by it, sufficient under the laws of any jurisdiction under which it is organized or in which it is doing business to conduct a trust business, and which is otherwise authorized under such laws to conduct such business and is subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authorities. If at any time any Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with these provisions it shall resign immediately.
 
Any Authenticating Agent may at any time resign by giving written notice of resignation to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time (and upon request by the Company shall) terminate the agency of any Authenticating Agent by giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon resignation, termination or cessation of eligibility of any Authenticating Agent, the Trustee may appoint an eligible successor Authenticating Agent acceptable to the Company. Any successor Authenticating Agent, upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder, shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent pursuant hereto. The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section.
 
SECTION 2.11. Global Securities.
 
(a) If the Company shall establish pursuant to Section 2.01 that the Securities of a particular series are to be issued as a Global Security, then the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with Section 2.04, authenticate and deliver, a Global Security which (i) shall represent, and shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of, all of the outstanding Securities of such series, (ii) shall be registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, (iii) shall be authenticated and delivered by the Trustee to the Depository or pursuant to the Depository's instruction and (iv) shall bear a legend substantially to the following effect: "Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.11 of the Indenture, this Security may be transferred, in whole but not in part, only to another nominee of the Depository or to a successor Depository or to a nominee of such successor Depository."
 
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.05, the Global Security of a series may be transferred, in whole but not in part and in the manner provided in Section 2.05, only to another nominee of the Depository for such series, or to a successor Depository for such series selected or approved by the Company or to a nominee of such successor Depository.
 
(c) If at any time the Depository for a series of Securities notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for such series or if at any time the Depository for such series shall no longer be registered or in good standing under the Exchange Act, or other applicable statute or regulation and a successor Depository for such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the
 
Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such condition, as the case may be, this Section 2.11 shall no longer be applicable to the Securities of such series and the Company will execute, and subject to Section 2.05, the Trustee will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security of such series in exchange for such Global Security. In addition, the Company may at any time determine that the Securities of any series shall no longer be represented by a Global Security and that the provisions of this Section 2.11 shall no longer apply to the Securities of such series. In such event the Company will execute, and subject to Section 2.05, the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officers' Certificate evidencing such determination by the Company, will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security of such series in exchange for such Global Security. Upon the exchange of the Global Security for such Securities in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, the Global Security shall be canceled by the Trustee. Such Securities in definitive registered form issued in exchange for the Global Security pursuant to this Section 2.11(c) shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depository, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Security Registrar. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the Depository for delivery to the persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
 
SECTION 2.12. Other Currencies.
 
In the case of the Securities of any series denominated in any currency other than Dollars or in a composite currency (the "Required Currency"), except as otherwise specified with respect to such Securities as contemplated by Section 2.01, the obligation of the Company to make any payment of the principal thereof, or the premium or interest thereon, shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender by the Company, or recovery by the Trustee, in any currency other than the Required Currency, except to the extent that such tender or recovery shall result in the Trustee timely holding the full amount of the Required Currency then due and payable. If any such tender or recovery is in a currency other than the Required Currency, the Trustee may take such actions as it considers appropriate to exchange such currency for the Required Currency. The costs and risks of any such exchange, including, without limitation, the risks of delay and exchange rate fluctuation, shall be borne by the Company, the Company shall remain fully liable for any shortfall or delinquency in the full amount of Required Currency then due and payable, and in no circumstances shall the Trustee be liable therefor except in the case of its negligence or willful misconduct.
 
SECTION 2.13. CUSIP Numbers.
 
The Company in issuing the Securities may use CUSIP numbers and/or other similar numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use CUSIP numbers and/or other similar numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to holders of Securities; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption
 
and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP numbers and/or other similar numbers.
 
 
 
SECTION 3.01. Redemption Rights.
 
The Company may redeem the Securities of any series issued hereunder on and after the dates and in accordance with the terms established for such series pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof.
 
SECTION 3.02. Redemption Procedures.
 
(a) In case the Company shall desire to exercise such right to redeem all or, as the case may be, a portion of the Securities of any series in accordance with the right reserved so to do, it shall give notice of such redemption to holders of the Securities of such series to be redeemed by mailing, first class postage prepaid, a notice of such redemption not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption of that series to such holders at their last addresses as they shall appear upon the Security Register. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the registered holder receives the notice. In any case, failure duly to give such notice to the holder of any Security of any series designated for redemption in whole or in part, or any defect in the notice, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Securities of such series or any other series. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption or subject to compliance with certain conditions provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate evidencing compliance with any such restriction or condition.
 
Unless otherwise so provided as to a particular series of Securities, if at the time of mailing of any notice of redemption the Company shall not have deposited with the paying agent an amount in cash sufficient to redeem all of the Securities called for redemption, including accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption, such notice shall state that it is subject to the receipt of redemption moneys by the paying agent on or before the date fixed for redemption (unless such redemption is mandatory) and such notice shall be of no effect unless such moneys are so received on or before such date.
 
Each such notice of redemption shall identify the Securities to be redeemed (including CUSIP numbers, if any), specify the date fixed for redemption and the redemption price at which Securities of that series are to be redeemed, and shall state that payment of the redemption price of such Securities to be redeemed will be made at the office or agency of the Company, upon presentation and surrender of such Securities,
 
that interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in said notice, that from and after said date interest will cease to accrue and that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case. If less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the notice to the holders of Securities of that series to be redeemed in whole or in part shall specify the particular Securities to be so redeemed. In case any Security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice which relates to such Security shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, and shall state that on and after the redemption date, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
 
(b) The Company shall give the Trustee at least 45 days' notice in advance of the date fixed for redemption (unless the Trustee shall agree to a shorter period) and, in the case of redemption of less than all the Securities of a series, as to the aggregate principal amount of Securities of the series to be redeemed, and thereupon the Trustee shall select, by lot or in such other manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair in its discretion and which may provide for the selection of a portion or portions (equal to $1,000 or any integral multiple thereof, subject to Sections 2.01(xi) and (xiv)) of the principal amount of such Securities of a denomination larger than $1,000 (subject as aforesaid), the Securities to be redeemed and shall thereafter promptly notify the Company in writing of the numbers of the Securities to be redeemed, in whole or in part.
 
The Company may, if and whenever it shall so elect, by delivery of instructions signed on its behalf by an Authorized Officer, instruct the Trustee or any paying agent to call all or any part of the Securities of a particular series for redemption and to give notice of redemption in the manner set forth in this Section, such notice to be in the name of the Company or its own name as the Trustee or such paying agent may deem advisable. In any case in which notice of redemption is to be given by the Trustee or any such paying agent, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to, or permit to remain with, the Trustee or such paying agent, as the case may be, such Security Register, transfer books or other records, or suitable copies or extracts therefrom, sufficient to enable the Trustee or such paying agent to give any notice by mail that may be required under the provisions of this Section.
 
SECTION 3.03. Effects of Redemption.
 
(a) If the giving of notice of redemption shall have been completed as above provided, the Securities or portions of Securities of the series to be redeemed specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with, subject to the Company Order or supplemental indenture hereto establishing the terms of such series of Securities, interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption and interest on such Securities or portions of Securities shall cease to accrue on and after the date fixed for redemption, unless the Company shall default in the payment of such redemption price and accrued interest with respect to any such Security or portion thereof. On presentation and surrender of such Securities on or after the date fixed for redemption at the place of payment specified in the notice, said Securities shall be paid and redeemed at the applicable redemption price for such series, together with, subject to the Company Order or supplemental indenture hereto establishing the terms of such series of Securities, interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption.
 
(b) Upon presentation of any Security of such series which is to be redeemed in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and the office or agency where the Security is presented shall deliver to the holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Security or Securities of the same series, of authorized denominations in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented.
 
SECTION 3.04. Sinking Funds.
 
The provisions of this Section 3.04 and Sections 3.05 and 3.06 shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series, except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01 for Securities of such series.
 
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". If provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 3.05. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of such series as provided for by the terms of Securities of such series.
 
SECTION 3.05. Delivery of Securities.
 
The Company (i) may deliver outstanding Securities of a series (other than any previously called for redemption) and (ii) may apply as a credit Securities of a series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment; provided that such Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the redemption price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the mandatory sinking fund and the amount of such mandatory sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
 
SECTION 3.06. Notices and Selection.
 
Not less than 45 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 3.05 and the basis for such credit and will, together with such Officers' Certificate, deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Not less than 30 days before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 3.02 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 3.02, except that the notice of redemption shall also state that the Securities
 
of such series are being redeemed by operation of the sinking fund and the sinking fund payment date. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Section 3.03.
 
 
 
The Company covenants and agrees for each series of the Securities as follows:
 
SECTION 4.01. Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest.
 
The Company will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities of that series at the time and place and in the manner provided herein and established with respect to such Securities.
 
SECTION 4.02. Maintenance of Office or Agency.
 
So long as any series of the Securities remain outstanding, the Company agrees to maintain an office or agency with respect to each such series, which shall be in the Borough of Manhattan, the City and State of New York or at such other location or locations as may be designated as provided in this Section 4.02, where (i) Securities of that series may be presented for payment, (ii) Securities of that series may be presented as hereinabove authorized for registration of transfer and exchange, and (iii) notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be given or served, such designation to continue with respect to such office or agency until the Company shall, by written notice signed by an Authorized Officer and delivered to the Trustee, designate some other office or agency for such purposes or any of them. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, notices and demands. The Trustee will initially act as paying agent for the Securities.
 
The Company may also from time to time, by written notice signed by an Authorized Officer and delivered to the Trustee, designate one or more other offices or agencies for the foregoing purposes within or outside the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York, and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligations to maintain an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York for the foregoing purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.
 
SECTION 4.03. Paying Agent.
 
(a) If the Company shall appoint one or more paying agents for all or any series of the Securities, other than the Trustee, the Company will cause each such paying agent to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section:
 
(1) that it will hold all sums held by it as such agent for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on the Securities of that series (whether such sums have been paid to it by the Company or by any other obligor of such Securities) in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled thereto;
 
(2) that it will give the Trustee prompt notice of any failure by the Company (or by any other obligor of such Securities) to make any payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on the Securities of that series when the same shall be due and payable;
 
(3) that it will, at any time during the continuance of any failure referred to in the preceding paragraph (a)(2) above, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such paying agent; and
 
(4) that it will perform all other duties of paying agent as set forth in this Indenture.
 
(b) If the Company shall act as its own paying agent with respect to any series of the Securities, it will on or before each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on Securities of that series, set aside, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay such principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due on Securities of that series until such sums shall be paid to such persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of such action, or any failure (by it or any other obligor on such Securities) to take such action. Whenever the Company shall have one or more paying agents for any series of Securities, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with the paying agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled to such principal, premium or interest, and (unless such paying agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
 
(c) Anything in this Section to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the agreement to hold sums in trust as provided in this Section is subject to the provisions of Section 11.04, and (ii) the Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or direct any paying agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such paying agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same terms and conditions as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such paying agent; and, upon such payment by any paying agent to the Trustee, such paying agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
 
SECTION 4.04. Appointment of Successor Trustee.
 
The Company, whenever necessary to avoid or fill a vacancy in the office of Trustee, will appoint, in the manner provided in Section 7.10, a Trustee, so that there shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder.
 
SECTION 4.05. Consolidation or Merger.
 
The Company will not, while any of the Securities remain outstanding, consolidate with, or merge into, or merge into itself, or sell or convey all or substantially all of its property to any other Person unless the provisions of Article Ten hereof are complied with.
 
SECTION 4.06. Original Issue Discount.
 
In the event that the Company issues a Discount Security, the Company shall file with the Trustee at or prior to the time of the authentication of such Discount Security a written notice, in such form as mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Trustee, specifying the amount of original issue discount that will be accrued on such Discount Security in each calendar year from the date of issuance to the maturity thereof.
 
 
 
SECTION 5.01. Securityholders' List.
 
The Company will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee (a) on each regular record date (as defined in Section 2.03) for the Securities of each Tranche of a series a list, in such form as the Trustee may reasonably require, of the names and addresses of the holders of such Tranche of Securities as of such regular record date, provided, that the Company shall not be obligated to furnish or cause to be furnished such list at any time that the list shall not differ in any respect from the most recent list furnished to the Trustee by the Company and (b) at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing within 30 days after the receipt by the Company of any such request, a list of similar form and content as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the time such list is furnished; provided, however, no such list need be furnished for any series for which the Trustee shall be the Security Registrar.
 
SECTION 5.02. Security Registrar.
 
(a) The Trustee shall preserve, in as current a form as is reasonably practicable, all information as to the names and addresses of the holders of Securities contained in the most recent list furnished to it as provided in Section 5.01 and as to the names and addresses of holders of Securities received by the Trustee in its capacity as Security Registrar (if acting in such capacity).
 
(b) The Trustee may destroy any list furnished to it as provided in Section 5.01 upon receipt of a new list so furnished.
 
(c) In case three or more holders of Securities of a series (hereinafter referred to as "applicants") apply in writing to the Trustee, and furnish to the Trustee reasonable proof that each such applicant has owned a Security for a period of at least six months preceding the date of such application, and such application states that the applicants desire to communicate with other holders of Securities of such series or holders of all Securities with respect to their rights under this Indenture or under such Securities, and is accompanied by a copy of the form of proxy or other communication which such applicants propose to transmit, then the Trustee shall, within five Business Days after the receipt of such application, at its election, either:
 
(1) afford to such applicants access to the information preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section 5.02; or
 
(2) inform such applicants as to the approximate number of holders of Securities of such series or of all Securities, as the case may be, whose names and addresses appear in the information preserved at the time by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section 5.02, and as to the approximate cost of mailing to such Securityholders the form of proxy or other communication, if any, specified in such application.
 
(d) If the Trustee shall elect not to afford such applicants access to such information, the Trustee shall, upon the written request of such applicants, mail to each holder of such series or of all Securities, as the case may be, whose name and address appears in the information preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section 5.02, a copy of the form of proxy or other communication which is specified in such request, with reasonable promptness after a tender to the Trustee of the material to be mailed and of payment, or provision for the payment, of the reasonable expenses of mailing, unless within five days after such tender, the Trustee shall mail to such applicants and file with the Commission, together with a copy of the material to be mailed, a written statement to the effect that, in the opinion of the Trustee, such mailing would be contrary to the best interests of the holders of Securities of such series or of all Securities, as the case may be, or would be in violation of applicable law. Such written statement shall specify the basis of such opinion. If the Commission, after opportunity for a hearing upon the objections specified in the written statement so filed, shall enter an order refusing to sustain any of such objections or if, after the entry of an order sustaining one or more of such objections, the Commission shall find, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that all the objections so sustained have been met and shall enter an order so declaring, the Trustee shall mail copies of such material to all such Securityholders with reasonable promptness after the entry of such order and the renewal of such tender; otherwise, the Trustee shall be relieved of any obligation or duty to such applicants respecting their application.

(e) Delivery of such information, documents or reports to the Trustee pursuant to Section 5.03(a), 5.03(b) or 5.03(c) is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt thereof shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including, the Company's compliance with any of the covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on an Officers' Certificate).

SECTION 6.01. Events of Default; Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
 
(a) Whenever used herein with respect to Securities of a particular series, "Event of Default" means any one or more of the following events which has occurred and is continuing:
 
(1) default in the payment of any installment of interest upon any of the Securities of that series, as and when the same shall become due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days (subject to the deferral of any due date in the case of an extension period);
 
(2) default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any of the Securities of that series as and when the same shall become due and payable whether at maturity, upon redemption, by declaration or otherwise;
 
(3) default in the making or satisfaction of any sinking fund payment or analogous obligation as and when the same shall become due and payable by the terms of the Securities of that series, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days;
 
(4) failure on the part of the Company duly to observe or perform any other of the covenants or agreements on the part of the Company with respect to that series contained in such Securities or otherwise established with respect to that series of Securities pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof or contained in this Indenture (other than a covenant or agreement which has been expressly included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of one or more series of Securities other than such series) for a period of 90 days after the date on which written notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder, shall have been given to the Company by the Trustee, by registered or certified mail, or to the Company and the Trustee by the holders of at least twenty-five percent in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series at the time outstanding;
 
(5) a decree or order by a court having jurisdiction in the premises shall have been entered adjudging the Company as bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking liquidation or reorganization of the Company under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any other similar applicable Federal or State law, and such decree or order shall have continued unvacated and unstayed for a period of 90 consecutive days; or an involuntary case shall be commenced under such Code in respect of the Company and shall continue undismissed for a period of 90 consecutive days or an order for relief in such case shall have been entered; or a decree or order of a court having jurisdiction in the premises shall have been entered for the appointment on the ground of insolvency or bankruptcy of a receiver or custodian or liquidator or trustee or assignee in bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company or of its property, or for the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and such decree or order shall have remained in force unvacated and unstayed for a period of 90 consecutive days;
 
(6) the Company shall institute proceedings to be adjudicated a voluntary bankrupt, or shall consent to the filing of a bankruptcy proceeding against it, or shall file a petition or answer or consent seeking liquidation or reorganization under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any other similar applicable Federal or State law, or shall consent to the filing of any such petition, or shall consent to the appointment on the ground of insolvency or bankruptcy of a receiver or custodian or liquidator or trustee or assignee in bankruptcy or insolvency of it or of its property, or shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or
 
(7) the occurrence of any other Event of Default with respect to Securities of such series, as contemplated by Section 2.01 hereof.
 
(b) In each and every such case, unless the principal of all the Securities of that series shall have already become due and payable, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than twenty-five percent in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series then outstanding hereunder, by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by such Securityholders), may declare the principal (or, if any of such Securities are Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount thereof as may be specified by their terms as contemplated by Section 2.01) of all the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become and shall be immediately due and payable, anything contained in this Indenture or in the Securities of that series or established with respect to that series pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof to the contrary notwithstanding.
 
(c) Section 6.01(b), however, is subject to the condition that if, at any time after the principal of the Securities of that series shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the monies due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the Company shall pay or shall deposit with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest upon all the Securities of that series and the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any and all Securities of that series which shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest upon such principal and premium, if any, and, to the extent that such payment is enforceable under applicable law, upon overdue installments of interest, at the rate per annum expressed in the Securities of that series to the date of such payment or deposit) and the amount payable to the Trustee under Section 7.06, and any and all defaults under the Indenture, other than the nonpayment of principal on Securities of that series which shall not have become due by their terms, shall have been remedied or waived as provided in Section 6.06, then and in every such case the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series then outstanding, by written notice to the Company and to the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences with respect to that series of Securities; but no such rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default, or shall impair any right consequent thereon.
 
(d) In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right with respect to Securities of that series under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of such rescission or annulment or for any other reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case the Company and the Trustee shall be restored respectively to their former positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company and the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceedings had been taken.
 
SECTION 6.02. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
 
(a) The Company covenants that in case an Event of Default described in subsection 6.01(a)(1) or (a)(2) shall have occurred and be continuing, upon demand of the Trustee, the Company will pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the Securities of that series, the whole amount that then shall have become due and payable
 
on all such Securities for principal (and premium, if any) or interest, or both, as the case may be, with interest upon the overdue principal (and premium, if any) and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law and without duplication of any other amounts paid by the Company in respect thereof) upon overdue installments of interest at the rate per annum expressed in the Securities of that series; and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, and the amount payable to the Trustee under Section 7.06.
 
(b) In case the Company shall fail forthwith to pay such amounts upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, shall be entitled and empowered to institute any action or proceedings at law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute any such action or proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Company or other obligor upon the Securities of that series and collect in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or other obligor upon the Securities of that series wherever situated the monies adjudged or decreed to be payable.
 
(c) In case of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, readjustment, arrangement, composition or other judicial proceedings affecting the Company, any other obligor on such Securities, or the creditors or property of either, the Trustee shall have power to intervene in such proceedings and take any action therein that may be permitted by the court and shall (except as may be otherwise provided by law) be entitled to file such proofs of claim and other papers and documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the holders of Securities of such series allowed for the entire amount due and payable by the Company or such other obligor under this Indenture at the date of institution of such proceedings and for any additional amount which may become due and payable by the Company or such other obligor after such date, and to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claim, and to distribute the same after the deduction of the amount payable to the Trustee under Section 7.06; and any receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization is hereby authorized by each of the holders of Securities of such series to make such payments to the Trustee, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to such Securityholders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it under Section 7.06.
 
(d) All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under any of the terms established with respect to Securities of that series, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of such Securities, or the production thereof at any trial or other proceeding relative thereto, and any such suit or proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for payment to the Trustee of any amounts due under Section 7.06, be for the ratable benefit of the holders of the Securities of such series.
 
In case of an Event of Default hereunder, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in it by this Indenture by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any of such rights, either at law or in equity or in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement contained in the Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Indenture, or to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee by this Indenture or by law.
 
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Securityholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities of that series or the rights of any holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Securityholder in any such proceeding.
 
SECTION 6.03. Application of Money or Property Collected.
 
Any money or other property collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article Six or any money or other property otherwise distributable in respect of the Company's or any other obligor's obligations under this Indenture with respect to a particular series of Securities shall be applied in the order following, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money or property on account of principal (or premium, if any) or interest, upon presentation of the several Securities of that series, and stamping thereon the payment, if only partially paid, and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:
 
FIRST: To the payment of costs and expenses of collection and of all amounts payable to the Trustee (including any predecessor Trustee) under Section 7.06;
 
SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid upon Securities of such series for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, respectively; and
 
THIRD: To the Company.
 
The Trustee may fix a record date for any payment to Holders.
 
SECTION 6.04. Requests by Holders.
 
No holder of any Security of any series shall have any right by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law upon or under or with respect to this Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless such holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of an Event of Default and of the continuance thereof with respect to Securities of such series specifying such Event of Default, as hereinbefore provided, and unless
 
also the holders of not less than twenty-five percent in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series then outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name as trustee hereunder and shall have offered to the Trustee such reasonable indemnity as it may require against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, shall have failed to institute any such action, suit or proceeding; it being understood and intended, and being expressly covenanted by the taker and holder of every Security of such series with every other such taker and holder and the Trustee, that no one or more holders of Securities of such series shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of the holders of any other of such Securities, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such holder, or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all holders of Securities of such series. For the protection and enforcement of the provisions of this Section, each and every Securityholder and the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given either at law or in equity.
 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture, however, the right of any holder of any Security to receive payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such Security, as therein provided, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Security (or in the case of redemption, on the redemption date), or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates or redemption date, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such holder.
 
SECTION 6.05. Remedies Cumulative; No Waiver.
 
(a) All powers and remedies given by this Article to the Trustee or to the Securityholders shall, to the extent permitted by law, be deemed cumulative and not exclusive of any others thereof or of any other powers and remedies available to the Trustee or the holders of the Securities, by judicial proceedings or otherwise, to enforce the performance or observance of the covenants and agreements contained in this Indenture or otherwise established with respect to such Securities.
 
(b) No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any holder of any of the Securities to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event of Default occurring and continuing as aforesaid shall impair any such right or power, or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such default or an acquiescence therein; and, subject to the provisions of Section 6.04, every power and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Securityholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Securityholders.
 
SECTION 6.06. Control of Holders.
 
The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time outstanding, determined in accordance with Section 8.04, shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to such series;
 
provided, however, that such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture or unduly prejudicial to the rights of holders of Securities of any other series at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 8.04 not parties thereto, or involve the Trustee in any personal liability or expense. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee in good faith shall, by a Responsible Officer or Officers of the Trustee, determine that the proceeding so directed might involve the Trustee in personal liability. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time outstanding affected thereby, determined in accordance with Section 8.04, may on behalf of the holders of all of the Securities of such series waive any past default in the performance of any of the covenants contained herein or established pursuant to Section 2.01 with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, any of the Securities of that series as and when the same shall become due by the terms of such Securities otherwise than by acceleration (unless such default has been cured and a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest and principal otherwise than by acceleration and any premium has been deposited with the Trustee (in accordance with Section 6.01(c))) or a call for redemption of Securities of that series. Upon any such waiver, the default covered thereby shall be deemed to be cured for all purposes of this Indenture and the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Securities of such series shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
SECTION 6.07. Notice by Trustee.
 
The Trustee shall, within 90 days after the occurrence of a default with respect to a particular series, transmit by mail, first class postage prepaid, to the holders of Securities of that series, as their names and addresses appear upon the Security Register, notice of all defaults with respect to that series known to the Trustee, unless such defaults shall have been cured or waived before the giving of such notice (the term "defaults" for the purposes of this Section being hereby defined to be the events specified in subsections (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of Section 6.01(a), not including any periods of grace provided for therein and irrespective of the giving of notice provided for by subsection (4) of Section 6.01(a)); provided, that, except in the case of default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any of the Securities of that series or in the payment of any sinking or analogous fund installment established with respect to that series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee, or a trust committee of directors and/or Responsible Officers, of the Trustee in good faith determine that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the holders of Securities of that series; provided further, that in the case of any default of the character specified in Section 6.01(a)(4) with respect to Securities of such series no such notice to the holders of the Securities of that series shall be given until at least 30 days after the occurrence thereof.
 
SECTION 6.08. Undertaking for Costs.
 
All parties to this Indenture agree, and each holder of any Securities by his or her acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in
 
such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Securityholder, or group of Securityholders, holding more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Securityholder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Security of such series, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Security or established pursuant to this Indenture.
 
 
 
SECTION 7.01. Certain Duties and Responsibilities.
 
(a) The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to Securities of a series and after the curing of all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series which may have occurred, shall undertake to perform with respect to Securities of such series such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. In case an Event of Default with respect to Securities of a series has occurred (which has not been cured or waived), the Trustee shall exercise with respect to Securities of that series such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.
 
(b) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
 
(1) prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to Securities of a series and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default with respect to that series which may have occurred: (i) the duties and obligations of the Trustee shall with respect to Securities of such series be determined solely by the express provisions of this Indenture, and the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to Securities of such series except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and (ii) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee may with respect to Securities of such series conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein);
 
(2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and
 
(3) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the written direction of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time outstanding relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of that series.
 
(c) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
 
(d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 7.01.
 
SECTION 7.02. Certain Rights of Trustee.
 
Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.01:
 
(a) The Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, demand, approval, bond, security or other paper or document believed by it (i) to be genuine and (ii) to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;
 
(b) Any request, direction, order or demand of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Company Order, Board Resolution or an Officers' Certificate (unless other evidence in respect thereof is specifically prescribed herein);
 
(c) The Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection and the advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;
 
(d) The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of
 
the Securityholders, pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, unless such Securityholders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred therein or thereby; nothing herein contained shall, however, relieve the Trustee of the obligation, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to a series of the Securities (which has not been cured or waived) to exercise with respect to Securities of that series such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and to use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs;
 
(e) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture;
 
(f) The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, direction, order, demand, approval, bond, security, or other papers or documents, unless requested in writing so to do by the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of the particular series affected thereby (determined as provided in Section 8.04); provided, however, that if the payment within a reasonable time to the Trustee of the costs, expenses or liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such investigation is, in the opinion of the Trustee, not reasonably assured to the Trustee by the security afforded to it by the terms of this Indenture, the Trustee may require indemnity or security against such costs, expenses or liabilities as a condition to so proceeding. The reasonable expense of every such examination shall be paid by the Company or, if paid by the Trustee, shall be repaid by the Company upon demand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee, in its discretion, may make, but need not make nor shall it be required to make, such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit. In making any investigation required or authorized by this subparagraph, the Trustee shall be entitled to examine books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney;
 
(g) The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder;
 
(h) The permissive right of the Trustee to do things enumerated in this Indenture shall not be construed as a duty;
 
(i) The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and each agent, custodian and other Person employed to act hereunder;
 
(j) The Trustee may request that the Company deliver a certificate setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of officers authorized at such time to
 
take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture, which certificate may be signed by any person authorized to sign an Officers' Certificate, including any person specified as so authorized in any such certificate previously delivered and not superseded;
 
(k) The Trustee shall not be deemed to have or be charged with knowledge of any Default or Event of Default except with respect to Securities of any series (i) a Default or Event of Default under subsection (a)(1), (a)(2) or (a)(3) of Section 6.01 as long as the Trustee is acting as paying agent for such series of Securities or (ii) any Default or Event of Default as to which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee written notice of which from the Company or any Holder and such notice states that it is a "Notice of Default" or "Notice of Event of Default" hereunder, as the case may be, and references the Securities and this Indenture; and
 
(l) Whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Trustee (unless other evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its part, conclusively rely upon an Officers' Certificate.
 
SECTION 7.03. Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities.
 
(a) The recitals contained herein and in the Securities (other than the Certificate of Authentication on the Securities) shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the same.
 
(b) The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities.
 
(c) The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Company of any of the Securities or of the proceeds of such Securities, or for the use or application of any monies paid over by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture or established pursuant to Section 2.01, or for the use or application of any monies received by any paying agent other than the Trustee.
 
SECTION 7.04. May Hold Securities.
 
The Trustee or any paying agent or Security Registrar, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, paying agent or Security Registrar.
 
SECTION 7.05. Monies Held in Trust.
 
Subject to the provisions of Section 11.04, all monies received by the Trustee shall, until used or applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the purposes for which they were received, but need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any monies received by it hereunder except such as it may agree in writing with the Company to pay thereon.
 
SECTION 7.06. Compensation; Reimbursement; and Indemnification.
 
(a) The Company covenants and agrees to pay to the Trustee from time to time, and the Trustee shall be entitled to such compensation as shall be agreed in writing between the Company and the Trustee (which shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust) for all services rendered by it in the execution of the trusts hereby created and in the exercise and performance of any of the powers and duties hereunder of the Trustee, and the Company will pay or reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any of the provisions of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the reasonable expenses and disbursements of its counsel and agents and of all persons not regularly in its employ) except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may arise from its negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. The Company also covenants and agrees to the fullest extent permitted by law, to indemnify each of the Trustee, or any predecessor Trustee, its officers, employees, directors, shareholders and agents, for, and to hold them harmless against, any and all loss, damage, claim, liability or expense, including taxes (other than taxes based upon, measured by or determined by the income of the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee), incurred without negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the trusts and its duties under this Indenture, including the enforcement of this provision and the reasonable costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder.
 
(b) The obligations of the Company under this Section to compensate and indemnify the Trustee and to pay or reimburse the Trustee for expenses, disbursements and advances shall constitute additional indebtedness hereunder. Such additional indebtedness shall be secured by a lien prior to that of the Securities upon all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as such, except funds held in trust under Section 11.02.
 
(c) In addition to and without prejudice to any other rights available to the Trustee under applicable law and any of the provisions of this Indenture, when the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with an Event of Default, the expenses (including reasonable charges and expenses of its counsel) and compensation for its services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under applicable Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.
 
(d) The provisions of this Section 7.06, including the lien of the Trustee, shall survive the satisfaction and discharge or other termination for any reason of this Indenture, the resignation or removal of the Trustee for any reason hereunder and any rejection or termination of this Indenture under any applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law.
 
(e) "Trustee" for purposes of this Section 7.06 shall include any predecessor Trustee; provided, however, that the negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of any Trustee hereunder shall not affect the rights of any other Trustee hereunder.
 
SECTION 7.07. Reliance on Officers' Certificate.
 
Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.01, whenever in the administration of the provisions of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or suffering or omitting to take any action hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee and such certificate, in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, shall be full warrant to the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it under the provisions of this Indenture upon the faith thereof.
 
SECTION 7.08. Conflicting Interests.
 
If the Trustee has acquired or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture. For purposes of Section 310(b)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act and to the extent permitted thereby, the Trustee, in its capacity as trustee in respect of the Securities of any series, shall not be deemed to have a conflict of interest arising from its capacity as trustee in respect of the Securities of any other series. The Trustee shall comply with Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act; provided, however, that there shall be excluded from the operation of Section 310(b)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act any indenture or indentures under which other securities or certificates of interest or participation in other securities of the Company are outstanding if the requirements for such exclusion set forth in Section 310(b)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act are met. To the extent permitted by such Act, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have a conflicting interest by virtue of being a trustee under this Indenture, in its capacity as trustee in respect of the Securities of any series, in its capacity as trustee in respect of the Securities of any other series, or by virtue of being a trustee under the Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of November 2, 2001, pursuant to which the Company's 6.00% Equity Security Units are outstanding, the Indenture, dated November 2, 2001, pursuant to which the Company's 5.95% debentures are outstanding, the Indenture, dated July 31, 2002, pursuant to which the Company's 4.875% notes and 6.80% notes are outstanding, or under any other indenture or indentures under which other securities, or certificates of interest or participation in other securities, of the Company are outstanding.
 
Nothing herein shall prevent the Trustee from filing with the Commission the application referred to in the second to last paragraph of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act.
 
SECTION 7.09. Trustee Required; Eligibility.
 
There shall at all times be a Trustee with respect to the Securities issued hereunder which shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or any State or Territory thereof or of the District of Columbia,
 
or a corporation or other person permitted to act as trustee by the Commission, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least 50 million dollars, and subject to supervision or examination by Federal, State, Territorial, or District of Columbia authority. If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. The Company may not, nor may any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Company, serve as Trustee. In case at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in Section 7.10.
 
SECTION 7.10. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.
 
(a) The Trustee or any successor hereafter appointed, may at any time resign with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company and by transmitting notice of resignation by mail, first class postage prepaid, to the Securityholders of such series, as their names and addresses appear upon the Security Register. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor trustee with respect to Securities of such series by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by order of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to the successor trustee. If no successor trustee shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment within 30 days after the mailing of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may, at the expense of the Company, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee with respect to Securities of such series, or any Securityholder of that series who has been a bona fide holder of a Security or Securities for at least six months may, subject to the provisions of Section 6.08, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment of a successor trustee. Such court may thereupon after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor trustee.
 
(b) In case at any time any of the following shall occur:
 
(1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions of Section 7.08 after written request therefor by the Company or by any Securityholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Security or Securities for at least six months; or
 
(2) The Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.09 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Securityholder; or
 
(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation;
 
then, in any such case, the Company may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities and appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by order of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor trustee, or, subject to the provisions of Section 6.08, unless, with respect to subsection (b)(1) above, the Trustee's duty to resign is stayed as provided in Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act, any Securityholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Security or Securities for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor trustee. Such court may thereupon after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee.
 
(c) The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time outstanding may at any time remove the Trustee with respect to such series and appoint a successor trustee. If no successor trustee shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment within 30 days after the mailing of such notice of removal, the Trustee being removed may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
 
(d) Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor trustee with respect to the Securities of a series pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as provided in Section 7.11.
 
(e) Any successor trustee appointed pursuant to this Section may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more series or all of such series, and at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series.
 
SECTION 7.11. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.
 
(a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or the successor trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all the rights, powers, and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder, subject to the prior lien provided for in Section 7.06(b).
 
(b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates, (2) shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust, that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee and that no Trustee shall be responsible for any act or failure to act on the part of any other Trustee hereunder; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein, such retiring Trustee shall with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates have no further responsibility for the exercise of rights and powers or for the performance of the duties and obligations vested in the Trustee under this Indenture, and each such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor trustee, to the extent contemplated by such supplemental indenture, the property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates, subject to the prior lien provided for in Section 7.06(b).
 
(c) Upon request of any such successor trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.
 
(d) No successor trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor trustee shall be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and eligible under this Article.
 
(e) Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided in this Section, the Company shall transmit notice of the succession of such trustee hereunder by mail, first class postage prepaid, to the Securityholders, as their names and addresses appear upon the Security Register. If the Company fails to transmit such notice within ten days after acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee, the successor trustee shall cause such notice to be transmitted at the expense of the Company.
 
(f) Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be qualified under the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act and eligible under the provisions of Section 7.09, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities.
 
SECTION 7.12. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company.
 
If and when the Trustee shall become a creditor of the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding collection of claims against the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities).
 
SECTION 7.13. Application for Instructions from the Company.
 
Any application by the Trustee for written instructions from the Company may, at the option of the Trustee, set forth in writing any action proposed to be taken or omitted by the Trustee under this Indenture and the date on and/or after which such action shall be taken or such omission shall be effective. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken by, or omission of, the Trustee in accordance with a proposal included in such application on or after the date specified in such application (which date shall not be less than five Business Days after the date any Authorized Officer of the Company actually receives such application, unless any such Authorized Officer shall have consented in writing to any earlier date) unless prior to taking any such action (or the effective date in the case of an omission), the Trustee shall have received written instructions in response to such application specifying the action to be taken or omitted.
 
 
 
SECTION 8.01. Action by Holders.
 
Whenever in this Indenture it is provided that the holders of a majority or specified percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series may take any action (including the making of any demand or request, the giving of any notice, consent or waiver or the taking of any other action), the fact that at the time of taking any such action the holders of such majority or specified percentage of that series have joined therein may be evidenced by any instrument or any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by such holders of Securities of that series in person or by agent or proxy appointed in writing.
 
If the Company shall solicit from the Securityholders of any series any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, the Company may, at its option, as evidenced by an Officers' Certificate, fix in advance a record date for such series for the determination of Securityholders entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action may be given before or after the record date, but only the Securityholders of record at the close of business on the record date shall be deemed to be Securityholders for the purposes of determining whether Securityholders of the requisite proportion of outstanding Securities of that series have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, and for that purpose the outstanding Securities of that series shall be computed as of the record date; provided that no such authorization, agreement or consent by such Securityholders on the record date shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than six months after the record date.
 
In determining whether the holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Securities of a particular series have concurred in any direction, consent or waiver under this Indenture, the principal amount of a Discount Security that shall be deemed to be outstanding for such purposes shall be the amount of the principal thereof that would be due and payable as of the date of such determination upon a declaration of acceleration of the maturity thereof pursuant to Section 6.01.
 
SECTION 8.02. Proof of Execution.
 
Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, proof of the execution of any instrument by a Securityholder (such proof will not require notarization) or his agent or proxy and proof of the holding by any person of any of the Securities shall be sufficient if made in the following manner:
 
(a) The fact and date of the execution by any such person of any instrument may be proved in any reasonable manner acceptable to the Trustee.
 
(b) The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register of such Securities or by a certificate of the Security Registrar thereof.
 
(c) The Trustee may require such additional proof of any matter referred to in this Section as it shall deem necessary.
 
SECTION 8.03. Registered Holders.
 
Prior to the due presentment for registration of transfer of any Security, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and any Security Registrar may deem and treat the person in whose name such Security shall be registered upon the books of the Company as the absolute owner of such Security (whether or not such Security shall be overdue and
 
notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon made by anyone other than the Security Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of and premium, if any, and (subject to Section 2.03) interest on such Security and for all other purposes; and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
 
SECTION 8.04. Securities Owned by Company Disregarded.
 
In determining whether the holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Securities of a particular series have concurred in any direction, consent or waiver under this Indenture, Securities of that series which are owned by the Company or any other obligor on the Securities of that series or by any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under common control with the Company or any other obligor on the Securities of that series shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver, only Securities of such series which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Securities so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as outstanding for the purposes of this Section, if the pledgee shall establish to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not a person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company or any such other obligor. In case of a dispute as to such right, any decision by the Trustee taken upon the advice of counsel shall be full protection to the Trustee.
 
SECTION 8.05. Revocation of Consent; Consents Binding.
 
At any time prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in Section 8.01, of the taking of any action by the holders of the majority or percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series specified in this Indenture in connection with such action, any holder of a Security of that series which is shown by the evidence to be included in the Securities the holders of which have consented to such action may, by filing written notice with the Trustee, and upon proof of holding as provided in Section 8.02, revoke such action so far as concerns such Security. Except as aforesaid any such action taken by the holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of such Security, and of any Security issued in exchange therefor, on registration of transfer thereof or in place thereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon such Security. Any action taken by the holders of the majority or percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Company, the Trustee and the holders of all the Securities of that series.
 
 
 
SECTION 9.01. Supplemental Indentures Without Consent of Holders.
 
In addition to any supplemental indenture otherwise authorized by this Indenture, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto (which shall conform to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect), without the consent of the Securityholders, for one or more of the following purposes:
 
(a) to evidence the succession of another person to the Company, and the assumption by any such successor of the covenants of the Company contained herein or otherwise established with respect to the Securities; or
 
(b) to add to the covenants of the Company such further covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions for the protection of the holders of the Securities of all or any series, and to make the occurrence, or the occurrence and continuance, of a default in any of such additional covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions a default or an Event of Default with respect to such series permitting the enforcement of all or any of the several remedies provided in this Indenture as herein set forth; provided, however, that in respect of any such additional covenant, restriction, condition or provision such supplemental indenture may provide for a particular period of grace after default (which period may be shorter or longer than that allowed in the case of other defaults) or may provide for an immediate enforcement upon such default or may limit the remedies available to the Trustee upon such default or may limit the right of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series to waive such default; or
 
(c) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision contained herein or in any supplemental indenture which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision contained herein or in any supplemental indenture, or to make such other provisions in regard to matters or questions arising under this Indenture as shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture and shall not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of the holders of the Securities of any series; or
 
(d) to change or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture or to add any new provision to this Indenture; provided, however, that such change, elimination or addition shall become effective only when there is no Security outstanding of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture that is entitled to the benefit of such provisions; or
 
(e) to establish the form or terms of Securities of any series as permitted by Section 2.01; or
 
(f) to add any additional Events of Default with respect to all or any series of outstanding Securities; or
 
(g) to provide collateral security for the Securities; or
 
(h) to provide for the authentication and delivery of bearer securities and coupons appertaining thereto representing interest, if any, thereon and for the procedures for the registration, exchange and replacement thereof and for the giving of notice to, and the solicitation of the vote or consent of, the holders thereof, and for any other matters incidental thereto; or
 
(i) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a separate or successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, pursuant to the requirements of Article Seven; or
 
(j) to change any place or places where (1) the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on all or any series of Securities shall be payable, (2) all or any series of Securities may be surrendered for registration of transfer, (3) all or any series of Securities may be surrendered for exchange and (4) notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of all or any series of Securities and this Indenture may be served; provided, however, that any such place shall be located in New York, New York or be the principal office of the Company; or
 
(k) to provide for the payment by the Company of additional amounts in respect of certain taxes imposed on certain holders and for the treatment of such additional amounts as interest and for all matters incidental thereto; or
 
(l) to provide for the issuance of Securities denominated in a currency other than Dollars or in a composite currency and for all matters incidental thereto.
 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Trust Indenture Act as in effect at the date of the execution and delivery of this Indenture or at any time thereafter shall be amended and
 
(x) if any such amendment shall require one or more changes to any provisions hereof or the inclusion herein of any additional provisions, or shall by operation of law be deemed to effect such changes or incorporate such provisions by reference or otherwise, this Indenture shall be deemed to have been amended so as to conform to such amendment to the Trust Indenture Act, and the Company and the Trustee may, without the consent of any Securityholders, enter into a supplemental indenture hereto to effect or evidence such changes or additional provisions; or
 
(y) if any such amendment shall permit one or more changes to, or the elimination of, any provisions hereof which, at the date of the execution and delivery hereof or at any time thereafter, are required by the Trust Indenture Act to be contained herein, this
 
Indenture shall be deemed to have been amended to effect such changes or elimination, and the Company and the Trustee may, without the consent of any Securityholders, enter into a supplemental indenture hereto to effect such changes or elimination; or
 
(z) if, by reason of any such amendment, one or more provisions which, at the date of the execution and delivery hereof or at any time thereafter, are required by the Trust Indenture Act to be contained herein shall be deemed to be incorporated herein by reference or otherwise, or otherwise made applicable hereto, and shall no longer be required to be contained herein, the Company and the Trustee may, without the consent of any Securityholders, enter into a supplemental indenture hereto to effect the elimination of such provisions.
 
The Trustee is hereby authorized to join with the Company in the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations which may be therein contained, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
 
Any supplemental indenture authorized by the provisions of this Section may be executed by the Company and the Trustee without the consent of the holders of any of the Securities at the time outstanding, notwithstanding any of the provisions of Section 9.02.
 
SECTION 9.02. Supplemental Indentures with Consent of Holders.
 
With the consent (evidenced as provided in Section 8.01) of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series affected by such supplemental indenture or indentures at the time outstanding voting as one class, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto (which shall conform to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect) for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the holders of the Securities of such series under this Indenture; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the fixed maturity date or dates of any Securities of any series, (ii) extend the time of payment of interest or on any sinking fund payment, other than extensions permitted pursuant to Section 2.01, (iii) reduce the rate of interest on any Security, (iv) reduce the principal amount due for payment on any Security, (v) make the principal, premium, if any, or interest on a Security payable in any coin or currency other than that provided in such Security, (vi) modify any redemption or repurchase right to the detriment of a Securityholder, (vii) impair the right of any Securityholder to institute suit for payment, (viii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities, the holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture, or reduce the percentage of Securities, the holders of which are required to waive any covenant or default and its consequences, (ix) waive any past payment default, or (x) modify any provision of Section 9.02, without the consent of the holders of each Security then outstanding and affected thereby.
 
The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Persons entitled to consent to any indenture supplemental hereto. If a record date is fixed, the Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to consent to such supplemental indenture, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided, that unless such consent shall have become effective by virtue of the requisite percentage having been obtained prior to the date which is 90 days after such record date, any such consent previously given shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be cancelled and of no further effect.
 
Upon the request of the Company, accompanied by a Board Resolution authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of Securityholders required to consent thereto as aforesaid, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such supplemental indenture.
 
A supplemental indenture that changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture that has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or that modifies the rights of holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the holders of Securities of any other series.
 
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Securityholders of any series affected thereby under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.
 
Promptly after the execution by the Company and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order, shall transmit by mail, first class postage prepaid, a notice, setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture, to the Securityholders of all series affected thereby as their names and addresses appear upon the Security Register.

Any Person may merge into or consolidate with the Company provided that the Company is the surviving corporation.
 
SECTION 10.02. Effect of Consolidation or Merger.
 
(a) In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, transfer or other disposition and upon the assumption by the successor corporation, by
 
supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the due and punctual payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on all of the Securities of all series outstanding and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture or established with respect to each series of the Securities pursuant to Section 2.01 to be kept or performed by the Company with respect to each series, such successor corporation shall succeed to and be substituted for the Company, with the same effect as if it had been named herein as the party of the first part, and thereupon (provided, that in the case of a lease, the term of the lease is at least as long as the longest maturity of any Securities outstanding at such time) the predecessor corporation shall be relieved of all obligations and covenants under this Indenture and the Securities. Such successor corporation thereupon may cause to be signed, and may issue either in its own name or in the name of the Company or any other predecessor obligor on the Securities, any or all of the Securities issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee; and, upon the order of such successor company, instead of the Company, and subject to all the terms, conditions and limitations in this Indenture prescribed, the Trustee shall authenticate and shall deliver any Securities which previously shall have been signed and delivered by the officers of the predecessor Company to the Trustee for authentication, and any Securities which such successor corporation thereafter shall cause to be signed and delivered to the Trustee for that purpose.

(b) In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, transfer or other disposition such changes in phraseology and form (but not in substance) may be made in the Securities thereafter to be issued as may be appropriate.
 
(c) Nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the Securities shall prevent the Company from merging into itself or acquiring by purchase or otherwise all or any part of the property of any other corporation (whether or not affiliated with the Company).
 
SECTION 10.03. Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel as Evidence.
 
The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, shall receive an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, transfer or other disposition, and any such assumption, comply with the provisions of this Article.
 
 
 
SECTION 11.01. Company's Option to Effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
 
Securities of a series may be defeased in accordance with their terms and, unless the Company Order or supplemental indenture establishing the series otherwise provides, in accordance with this Article.
 
The Company at any time may terminate as to a series all of its obligations for such series under this Indenture ("legal defeasance option"). The Company at any time may terminate as to a series its obligations, if any, under any restrictive covenant, including under Section 4.05 and Article 10, which may be applicable to a particular series ("covenant defeasance option"). However, in the case of the legal defeasance option, the Company's obligations in Sections 2.05, 2.07, 4.02, 7.06, 7.10 and 11.04 shall survive until the Securities of the series are no longer outstanding; thereafter the Company's obligations in Sections 7.06, 7.10 and 11.04 shall survive.
 
The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, a series may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option, a series may not be accelerated by reference to any restrictive covenant which may be applicable to a particular series so defeased under the terms of the series.
 
The Company may exercise as to a series its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option if:
 
(1) The Company irrevocably deposits in trust with the Trustee or another trustee (x) money in an amount which shall be sufficient; or (y) Eligible Obligations the principal of and the interest on which when due, without regard to reinvestment thereof, will provide moneys, which, together with the money, if any, deposited or held by the Trustee or such other trustee, shall be sufficient, as demonstrated by evidence in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Trustee; or (z) a combination of money and Eligible Obligations which shall be sufficient, as demonstrated by evidence in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Trustee (which may include a verification report from an independent accountant), to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, due and to become due on such Securities on or prior to maturity;
 
(2) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that holders of the series will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of the defeasance but will realize income gain or loss on the Securities, including payments of interest thereon, in the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same time as would have been the
 
case if such defeasance had not occurred and which, in the case of legal defeasance, shall be (x) accompanied by a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service issued to the Company or (y) based on a change in Federal income tax law or regulation occurring after the date hereof; and
 
(3) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent to such defeasance as contemplated by this Article Eleven have been complied with.
 
In the event the Company exercises its option to effect a covenant defeasance with respect to the Securities of any series as described above and the Securities of that series are thereafter declared due and payable because of the occurrence of any Event of Default other than the Event of Default caused by failing to comply with the covenants which are defeased, the amount of money and securities on deposit with the Trustee may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the Securities of that series at the time of the acceleration resulting from such Event of Default. However, the Company shall remain liable for such payments.
 
The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the Eligible Obligations deposited pursuant to this Section 11.01 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the holders of outstanding Securities; provided, however, that the Trustee shall be entitled to charge any such tax, fee or other charge to such holder's account.
 
SECTION 11.02. Monies and Eligible Obligations Held in Trust.
 
All monies or Eligible Obligations deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 11.01 shall be held in trust and shall be available for payment as due, either directly or through any paying agent (including the Company acting as its own paying agent), to the holders of the particular series of Securities for the payment or redemption of which such monies or Eligible Obligations have been deposited with the Trustee.
 
SECTION 11.03. Release of Paying Agent.
 
In connection with the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture all monies or Eligible Obligations then held by any paying agent under the provisions of this Indenture shall, upon demand of the Company, be paid to the Trustee and thereupon such paying agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such monies or Eligible Obligations.
 
SECTION 11.04. Unclaimed Monies or Eligible Obligations.
 
Any monies or Eligible Obligations deposited with any paying agent or the Trustee, or then held by the Company, in trust for payment of principal of or premium or interest on the Securities of a particular series that are not applied but remain unclaimed by the holders of such Securities for at least two years after the date upon which the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on such Securities shall have respectively become due and payable, upon the written request of the Company and unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions of applicable escheat or abandoned or unclaimed property law, shall be repaid to the Company in
 
accordance with the terms of a Company Order received by the Trustee or if then held by the Company shall be discharged from such trust; and thereupon the paying agent and the Trustee shall be released from all further liability with respect to such monies or Eligible Obligations, and the holder of any of the Securities entitled to receive such payment shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company. Any unclaimed monies or Eligible Obligations held by the Trustee pursuant to this Section shall be held uninvested and without any liability for interest.
 
SECTION 11.05. Reinstatement.
 
If the Trustee or paying agent is unable to apply any money or Eligible Obligations in accordance with Section 11.01 by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Securities shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article 11, until such time as the Trustee or paying agent is permitted to apply all such money or Eligible Obligations in accordance with Section 11.01; provided, however, that if the Company makes any payment of principal of or interest on any Securities following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money or Eligible Obligations held by the Trustee or paying agent after payment in full to the Holders.
 
 
 
SECTION 12.01. Immunity of Certain Persons.
 
No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of this Indenture, or of any Security, or for any claim based thereon or otherwise in respect thereof, shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, past, present or future as such, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or any such predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise; it being expressly understood that this Indenture and the obligations issued hereunder are solely corporate obligations, and that no such personal liability whatever shall attach to, or is or shall be incurred by, the incorporators, stockholders, officers or directors as such, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation, or any of them, because of the creation of the indebtedness hereby authorized, or under or by reason of the obligations, covenants or agreements contained in this Indenture or in any of the Securities or implied therefrom; and that any and all such personal liability of every name and nature, either at common law or in equity or by constitution or statute, of, and any and all such rights and claims against, every such incorporator, stockholder, officer or director as such, because of the creation of the indebtedness hereby authorized, or under or by reason of the obligations, covenants or agreements contained in this Indenture or in any of the Securities or implied therefrom, are hereby expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as a consideration for, the execution of this Indenture and the issuance of such Securities.

SECTION 13.03. Surrender of Company Powers.
 
The Company by instrument in writing executed by authority of its Board of Directors and delivered to the Trustee may surrender any of the powers reserved to the Company under this Indenture and thereupon such power so surrendered shall terminate both as to the Company and as to any successor corporation.

WellPoint Health Networks Inc. (the "Company" or "WellPoint") is one of the nation's largest publicly traded managed health care companies. As of June 30, 2004, WellPoint had approximately 15.5 million medical members (including approximately 1.3 million BlueCard "host" members) and approximately 46.2 million specialty members. Host members are generally members who reside in a state in which a WellPoint subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan issued by a non-WellPoint controlled Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee. Through its subsidiaries, the Company offers a broad spectrum of network-based managed care plans to the large and small employer, individual, Medicaid and senior markets. The Company's managed care plans include preferred provider organizations ("PPOs"), health maintenance organizations ("HMOs"), point-of-service ("POS") plans, other hybrid plans and traditional indemnity plans. In addition, the Company offers managed care services, including underwriting, actuarial services, network access, medical management and claims processing. The Company also provides a broad array of specialty and other products and services including pharmacy benefits management, dental, vision, life insurance, preventive care, disability insurance, behavioral health, COBRA and flexible benefits account administration. With its recent acquisition of Cobalt Corporation, the Company now also offers workers' compensation insurance products and is currently the largest Medicare Part A fiscal intermediary in the nation, processing claims for providers in all 50 states. The Company markets its products in California primarily under the name Blue Cross of California, in Georgia primarily under the name Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia, in most parts of Missouri (except Kansas City and surrounding counties) primarily under the name Blue Cross Blue Shield of Missouri, in Wisconsin primarily under the names Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wisconsin and CompcareBlue and in various parts of the country under the names UNICARE and HealthLink. These products are marketed by the Company's various operating subsidiaries throughout the United States. The Company's customer base is diversified, with extensive membership among large and small employer groups and individuals and in the Medicare and Medicaid markets.
 
 
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of WellPoint have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for interim financial reporting. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, certain footnotes or other financial information have been condensed or omitted if they substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the Company's annual audited financial statements. In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements reflect all material adjustments (which are of a normal recurring nature) necessary for a fair statement of its financial position as of June 30, 2004, the results of its operations for the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, its changes in stockholders' equity for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and its cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the
 
 
 
operating results for the full year. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003. The Company has reclassified certain prior year amounts in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2004 presentation.
 
 
At June 30, 2004, the Company had three stock-based employee compensation plans: the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2000 Employee Stock Option Plan and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company accounts for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and related FASB interpretations. Accordingly, compensation cost for stock options under existing plans is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the Company's Common Stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income related to stock options granted because options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying Common Stock on the date of grant. In addition, no compensation expense is recorded for purchases under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan in accordance with APB No. 25.
 
Employee stock-based compensation included in reported net income includes restricted stock awards being amortized over the award's vesting period. The vesting period is generally three years from the date of the grant. During the six months ended June 30, 2004, 565,000 restricted shares of Company Common Stock with purchase prices below current fair market value were granted to employees of the Company with a fair value at the date of grant of $57.6 million. During the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2004, the Company recorded approximately $4.8 million and $9.1 million, respectively, in vested stock-based compensation. During the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2003, the Company recorded approximately $0.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively, in vested stock-based compensation. As of June 30, 2004, total unearned compensation from all non-vested stock awards totaled $49.6 million.
 
The following table illustrates the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure," for the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003.
 
 
 
 
The above pro forma disclosures may not be representative of the effects on reported pro forma net income for future years.
 
 
Principles of Consolidation
 
All of the Company's majority owned subsidiaries, including the Company's 51% interest in a community health partnership network, are accounted for under the consolidation method of accounting as required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 94, "Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries" ("SFAS No. 94"). Joint ventures in which the Company owns a 50% interest are recorded under the equity method of accounting as required by SFAS No. 94. Other investments in which the Company owns less than 50% of the voting stock are recorded in accordance with Accounting Principles Board No. 18, "The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock" ("APB No. 18"). The Company maintains certain investments in enterprises in which the Company owns less than 20% of the voting stock that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as a result of the Company's ability to exert significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the enterprise, as defined in APB No. 18."
 
 
 
Investments
 
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries participate in securities lending programs whereby the loaned marketable securities in the Company's portfolio are transferred to borrowers (generally independent brokers or dealers) approved by the Company based on, among other things, their creditworthiness in exchange for collateral initially equal to at least 102% of the value of the securities on loan and is thereafter maintained at a minimum of 100% of the market value of the securities loaned. The market value of the securities on loan to each borrower is monitored daily and the borrower is required to deliver additional collateral if the market value of the collateral falls below 100% of the market value of the securities on loan. Under the guidance provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities," the Company recognizes the collateral as an asset under "securities lending collateral" on its balance sheet and the Company records a corresponding liability for the obligation to return the collateral to the borrower under "securities lending payable."
 
Receivables, net
 
A Company subsidiary (the "PBM") operates as a pharmacy benefit manager under the trade name WellPoint Pharmacy Management. The PBM contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some of whom provide rebates based on use of the manufacturers' products by the PBM's affiliated and non-affiliated clients. The Company accrues rebates receivable on a monthly basis based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current estimates. The PBM bills these rebates to the manufacturers on a quarterly basis. The Company records rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction to "health care services and other benefits." Rebates attributable to non-affiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to non-affiliated clients in accordance with their contracts is also recorded. The Company generally receives rebates between two to five months after billing.
 
 
In December 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132 (revised 2003), "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106" ("SFAS No. 132R"). SFAS No. 132R retains the disclosure requirements contained in FASB Statement No. 132, "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits" ("SFAS No. 132"), and also requires additional disclosures to those in the original SFAS No. 132 that a company is required to make in its annual and interim financial statements. Except as noted, disclosures required by SFAS No. 132R are effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. The disclosure of estimated future benefit payments required by SFAS No. 132R is effective for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004. The adoption of SFAS
 
 
 
No. 132R did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
 
On December 8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 ("MMA") was signed into law. MMA introduced a voluntary Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit and created a new 28% federal subsidy for the sponsors of postretirement prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the new Medicare Part D benefit. The Company has determined that it qualifies for the subsidy under MMA. In May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003" ("FSP FAS 106-2"). Under FSP FAS 106-2, sponsors must consider the two new features of MMA in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation ("APBO") and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. In accordance with FSP FAS 106-2, the Company made a one-time election to recognize the impact of MMA as of December 31, 2003. Accordingly, any measures of the APBO and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and the related footnotes for the year ended December 31, 2003 included the effects of MMA. The impact of the adoption of the FSP FAS 106-2 on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2003 resulted in a reduction in the APBO of $7.9 million. The reduction in the 2004 net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2004 was $0.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively.
 
 
On October 31, 2003, the Company completed its acquisition of Health Core, Inc. ("Health Core"). Health Core currently provides outcomes research services to health plans and pharmaceutical organizations. The purchase price and related acquisition costs of approximately $4.1 million plus an additional $3.5 million in scheduled future payments over the next three years exceeded the estimated fair value of net assets acquired by $6.4 million. Under the purchase method of accounting, the Company assigned this amount to goodwill. In addition, the terms of the transaction include a provision for additional contingent payments of up to $5.5 million based on Health Core achieving certain financial performance targets during 2005, 2006 and 2007. The final amount of goodwill may increase as a result of these contingent payments. The operating results for Health Core are included in WellPoint's consolidated income statements for periods following the completion of the acquisition.
 
On September 24, 2003, the Company completed its acquisition of Cobalt, the parent company of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wisconsin. Cobalt served approximately 675,000 medical members (excluding BlueCard "host" members) as of September 30, 2003. The transaction was effective as of September 30, 2003 for accounting purposes. The operating results for Cobalt are included in WellPoint's consolidated income statement for periods following September 30, 2003. Under the terms of the transaction, total consideration paid to all holders of Cobalt common stock in the merger was approximately $427.5 million in cash and
 
 
 
approximately 7.3 million newly issued shares of WellPoint Common Stock (which included approximately 2.1 million shares issued to affiliates). The total purchase price of approximately $884.9 million valued as of September 24, 2003 was used to purchase net assets with a fair value of approximately $251.0 million. Included in the total purchase price was $12.1 million used to retire Cobalt's existing long-term debt at the time of acquisition. As a result of the acquisition of Cobalt, the Company incurred $37.1 million in expenses, primarily related to transaction costs. Generally accepted accounting principles require that these expenses, which are not associated with the generation of future revenues and have no future economic benefit, be reflected as assumed liabilities in the allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired. Estimated goodwill and other intangibles totaling $820.0 million includes $96.5 million of deferred tax liabilities relating to identified intangibles. Identified intangibles with definite useful lives are being amortized on a straight-line basis or the timing of related cash flows depending upon the expected amortization pattern over three to 23 years. The valuation of certain assets and liabilities and the implementation of the integration plan are not yet complete and, therefore, the allocation between goodwill and intangible assets recorded as of June 30, 2004 represents an estimate. As a result, the useful lives and method of amortization are only preliminary estimates. The current estimated purchase price allocation between goodwill and identifiable intangible assets is $578.7 million and $241.3 million, respectively. The entire estimated goodwill amount of $578.7 million is not deductible for tax purposes.
 
On June 30, 2003, the Company completed its acquisition of Golden West Health Plan, Inc. ("Golden West") for a purchase price of approximately $30.4 million. Upon completion of the acquisition, Golden West had net assets with a fair value of approximately $0.4 million and served more than 275,000 dental and vision members. As a result of the acquisition of Golden West, the Company incurred $0.4 million in expenses primarily related to transaction costs. The estimated purchase price allocation between goodwill and identifiable intangible assets was $17.3 million and $13.0 million, respectively. The operating results for Golden West are included in WellPoint's consolidated income statements for periods following the completion of the acquisition.
 
 
In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company completed the annual evaluation of its goodwill and other intangible assets at December 31, 2003, and determined that there was no impairment loss.
 
 
 
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment are as follows:
 
 
On October 31, 2003, WellPoint completed its acquisition of Health Core, as discussed in Note 6. As a result of the acquisition of Health Core, the Company recorded $6.4 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2004.
 
On September 24, 2003, WellPoint completed its acquisition of Cobalt, as discussed in Note 6. As a result of the acquisition of Cobalt, the Company recorded $578.7 million of goodwill and $241.3 million of identifiable intangible assets as of June 30, 2004. The valuation process is not yet complete and, therefore, the allocation between goodwill and other intangible assets recorded as of June 30, 2004 represents an estimate. The Company assumes no residual value for its amortizable intangible assets. The following table presents details of the acquired amortized and non-amortized intangible assets of Cobalt at cost as of June 30, 2004.
 
 
 
 
On June 30, 2003, WellPoint completed its acquisition of Golden West, as discussed in Note 6. As a result of the acquisition of Golden West, the Company recorded $17.3 million of goodwill and $13.0 million of identifiable intangible assets as of June 30, 2004. The Company assumes no residual value for its amortizable intangible assets. The following table presents details of the acquired amortized and non-amortized intangible assets of Golden West at cost as of June 30, 2004.
 
 
The gross carrying value, accumulated amortization and net carrying value of other intangible assets of the Company as of June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003 were as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
For the quarters ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, amortization expense relating to intangible assets was $11.7 million and $9.0 million, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, amortization expense relating to intangible assets was $23.5 million and $18.1 million, respectively. The following table presents the Company's estimated annual amortization expense for amortized intangible assets for each of the years ending December 31, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 (amounts in thousands). These estimates were calculated based on the gross carrying value of amortized intangible assets as of June 30, 2004 using the applicable amortization period.
 
 
 
The Company maintains three non-contributory defined benefit pension plans. The Restated Employees' Retirement Plan of Blue Cross of California (the "BCC Plan") covers employees of a collective bargaining unit. The WellPoint Health Networks Inc. Pension Accumulation Plan (the "WellPoint Pension Plan"), which was established on January 1, 1987, covers all eligible employees (employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement participate if the terms of the collective bargaining agreement provides for such participation) meeting certain age and service requirements. In addition, with the completion of the acquisition of Cobalt, WellPoint became the sponsor of Cobalt's UGS Pension Plan ("UGS Plan"). The UGS
 
 
 
Plan provides retirement benefits to covered employees based primarily on compensation and years of service. Plan assets are invested primarily in pooled income funds. The Company's policy is to fund its plans according to the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and applicable income tax regulations. The Company uses the projected unit credit method of cost determination. In October 2003, the Company amended the WellPoint Pension Plan effective January 1, 2004. Beginning January 1, 2004, employees who are of age 50 and over, with combined age and service totaling 65 or higher as of December 31, 2003, will continue to earn future contributions under the WellPoint Pension Plan based on eligible compensation. For other employees, the funds in their pension account earned through December 31, 2003 will continue to accrue interest. However, there will be no additional contributions based on the employee's earnings after December 31, 2003. Once the employee becomes vested (after five years of service), the employee will be eligible to receive a benefit from the WellPoint Pension Plan at retirement or termination based on his or her account balance as of December 31, 2003 plus accrued interest. Employees hired after December 31, 2003 will not be eligible to participate in the WellPoint Pension Plan.
 
Estimated net periodic pension expense for the Company's defined benefit pension plans included the following components:
 
 
 
 
Based on the funded status of all of WellPoint's pension plans, during 2004 the Company expects to contribute approximately $14.0 million and $0.6 million to the WellPoint Pension Plan and BCC Plan, respectively. No contributions are projected to be made for the UGS Plan during 2004. During the six months ended June 30, 2004, $5.1 million in contributions were made to WellPoint's pension plans.
 
 
The carrying amount of the Company's long-term indebtedness consisted of the following:

% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year commencing July 15, 2002. Interest is computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. At June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the Company had $349.1 million, (based upon the principal amount of $350.0 million less unamortized discount) of 2012 Notes outstanding. The related interest expense and amortization of discount and issue costs for each of the quarters ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 totaled $5.7 million. The related interest expense and amortization of discount and issue costs for each of the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 totaled $11.4 million.
 
The 2012 Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company's option at any time. The redemption price for any 2012 Notes redeemed will be equal to the greater of the following amounts: 1) 100% of the principal amount of the 2012 Notes being redeemed on the redemption date; or 2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the 2012 Notes being redeemed on that redemption date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury rate as determined by the Reference Treasury Dealer (J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. or Deutsche Banc Alex Brown or their respective successors), plus 25 basis points. In each case, the redemption price will also include accrued and unpaid interest on the 2012 Notes to the redemption date.

% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year commencing December 15, 2001. Interest is computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. At June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the Company had $449.6 million and $449.5 million, respectively, (based upon the principal amount of $450.0 million less unamortized discount) of 2006 Notes outstanding. The related interest expense and amortization of discount and issue costs for each of the quarters ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 was $7.5 million. The related interest expense and amortization of discount and issue costs for each of the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 was $14.9 million.
 
The 2006 Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company's option at any time. The redemption price for any 2006 Notes redeemed will be equal to the greater of the following amounts: 1) 100% of the principal amount of the 2006 Notes being redeemed on the redemption date; or 2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the 2006 Notes being redeemed on that redemption date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury rate as determined by the designated Reference Treasury Dealer (Salomon Smith Barney Inc. or UBS Warburg LLC or their respective successors), plus 25 basis points. In each case, the redemption price will also include accrued and unpaid interest on the 2006 Notes to the redemption date.
 
With the intention of reducing the interest expense associated with the 2006 Notes, the Company, on January 15, 2002, entered into a $200.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement. The swap agreement is a contract to exchange a fixed 6
 3
/
8
% rate for a floating rate based on the London InterBank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). In anticipation of the completion of the pending merger with Anthem, Inc. ("Anthem"), in June 2004 the Company terminated this interest rate swap agreement and received proceeds of $4.6 million. No gain was recognized under this transaction since the accounting adjustment to the carrying amount of the 2006 Notes of $4.6 million is treated as a premium and will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of the 2006 Notes (through June 15, 2006). Prior to the termination of the interest rate swap agreement, the Company recognized settlement income of $1.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, for the quarters ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, which offset the Company's interest expense for these periods. For the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, the Company recognized settlement income of $2.9 million and $3.9 million, respectively, from this interest rate swap agreement (see Note 10).
 
 
 
The 2012 and 2006 Notes are unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of the Company's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. All existing and future liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries are and will be effectively senior to the 2012 and 2006 Notes. The indenture governing the 2012 and 2006 Notes contains a covenant that limits the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to create liens on any of their property or assets to secure certain indebtedness without also securing the indebtedness under the 2012 and 2006 Notes.
 
Revolving Credit Facility
 
Effective as of March 30, 2001, the Company entered into two unsecured revolving credit facilities allowing aggregate indebtedness of $1.0 billion in principal amount. Borrowings under these facilities (which are generally referred to collectively as the Company's "revolving credit facility") bear interest at rates determined by reference to the bank's base rate or LIBOR plus a margin determined by reference to the then-current rating of the Company's unsecured long-term debt by specified rating agencies. A facility fee based on the facility amount, regardless of utilization, is payable quarterly. The facility fee rate is also determined by the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings by specified rating agencies. One facility, which provides for borrowings not to exceed $750.0 million at any time outstanding, expires on March 30, 2006, although it may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods under certain circumstances. The other facility, which provides for borrowings not to exceed $250.0 million at any time outstanding, expires on March 25, 2005. Any amount outstanding under this facility as of March 25, 2005 may be converted into a one-year term loan at the option of the Company and will bear interest at rates determined by reference to the bank's base rate or LIBOR plus a margin determined by reference to the then-current rating of the Company's unsecured long-term debt by specified rating agencies, plus 0.125% until paid in full.
 
Loans under the $250.0 million facility are made on a committed basis. Loans under the $750.0 million facility are made on a committed basis or pursuant to an auction bid process. The $750.0 million facility also contains sublimits for letters of credit and "swingline" loans. Each credit agreement requires the Company to maintain certain financial ratios and contains restrictive covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the granting of certain liens, limitations on acquisitions and investments and limitations on changes in control. As of June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the Company had no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
 
Commercial Paper Program
 
In April 2002, the Company commenced a commercial paper program providing for the issuance of up to $1.0 billion in aggregate maturity value of short-term indebtedness (known generally as "commercial paper"). The commercial paper is being issued by the Company without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act") in reliance
 
 
 
upon the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(2) of the 1933 Act. The commercial paper is issued in denominations of $100,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof and will bear such interest rates, if interest-bearing, or will be sold at such discount from their face amounts, as agreed upon by the Company and the dealer or dealers acting in connection with the commercial paper program. The commercial paper may be issued with varying maturities up to a maximum of 270 days from the date of issuance.
 
As of December 31, 2003, outstanding commercial paper totaled approximately $429.8 million. The average maturity for the commercial paper was 43 days as of December 31, 2003. The weighted average yield on the outstanding commercial paper as of December 31, 2003 was 1.25%. The Company's intent was to maintain commercial paper borrowings of at least the amount outstanding at December 31, 2003 for more than one year. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 6, "Classification of Short-Term Obligations Expected to Be Refinanced" ("SFAS No. 6") provides that a company may classify a short-term obligation as a long-term liability if the company intends to refinance the short-term obligation on a long-term basis and if the company has the ability to consummate such refinancing on a long-term basis. SFAS No. 6 states that refinancing a short-term obligation on a long-term basis means either replacing it with a long-term obligation or replacing it with short-term obligations for an uninterrupted period extending beyond one year from the date of a company's balance sheet. SFAS No. 6 further states that the company's ability to consummate a refinancing is demonstrated where (i) the company has entered into a financing agreement that does not expire within the year following the applicable balance sheet date, (ii) the financing agreement is not cancelable (and the obligations incurred thereunder are not callable) during such period except as a result of noncompliance, (iii) there is no violation of the financing agreement on the applicable balance sheet date or prior to issuance of such balance sheet, and (iv) the company expects the financing parties to be financially capable of honoring the agreement.
 
Management believes that the Company has met the SFAS No. 6 requirements for its commercial paper borrowings as of December 31, 2003 to be classified as a long-term liability because the Company's practice and intent since the inception of the commercial paper program in April 2002 has been to replace the short-term commercial paper outstanding at expiration with additional short-term commercial paper for an uninterrupted period extending for more than one year or with borrowings under the Company's credit facilities. Regarding the Company's ability to consummate the refinancing, (i) the commercial paper and credit facility agreements will not expire prior to December 31, 2004, (ii) the commercial paper and credit facility agreements are not cancelable (and the obligations incurred thereunder are not callable) prior to December 31, 2004 unless the Company has defaulted, (iii) there was no violation under the commercial paper and credit facility agreements during the relevant period, and (iv) the financing entities under the commercial paper and credit facility agreements are institutions that must meet certain criteria selected by the Company and the Company expects all such financing entities to be financially capable of honoring their commitments under the commercial paper and credit facility agreements. Accordingly, for financial reporting
 
 
 
purposes, the Company classified its outstanding commercial paper balance under non-current liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2003. The related interest expense for the quarters ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 was $1.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The related interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 was $2.3 million and $2.6 million, respectively.
 
The Company is currently subject to a pending merger with Anthem, Inc. Under the merger agreement with Anthem, the Company is obligated to repurchase or otherwise retire any outstanding commercial paper prior to the closing of the merger. In June 2004, in anticipation of the merger closing, the Company repaid the entire outstanding balance under the commercial paper program.
 
Debt Covenants
 
The Company's revolving credit facility requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios and contains other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness by subsidiaries and the granting of certain liens, limitations on acquisitions and investments and limitations on changes in control. As of June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with the requirements in these agreements.
 
 
The Company maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to minimize significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations caused by interest rate volatility. The Company's goal is to maintain a balance between fixed and floating interest rates on its long-term debt.
 
By using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates, the Company exposes itself to credit risk and market risk. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in interest rates. The Company manages exposure to market risk associated with interest rate contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken.
 
The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate exposures. The principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with financial and investing activities. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions with which the Company also has other financial relationships. These counterparties expose the Company to credit loss in the event of non-performance. However, the Company does not anticipate non-performance by the other parties. As of December 31, 2003, the Company reported a derivative asset of $9.9 million on an interest rate swap agreement that the company designated as a fair value hedge on its 2006 Notes. In June 2004, the Company terminated this interest rate swap agreement and received proceeds of $4.6 million (see further discussion below). As of June 30, 2004, the Company was not party to any effective interest rate swap agreements.
 
 
 
Fair Value Hedges
 
With the intention of reducing the interest expense associated with the 2006 Notes, the Company, on January 15, 2002, entered into a $200.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement. The swap agreement is a contract to exchange a fixed 6
 3
/
8
% rate for a LIBOR-based floating rate. The swap agreement expires June 15, 2006. As discussed above, in anticipation of the completion of the pending merger with Anthem, in June 2004 the Company terminated this interest rate swap agreement and received proceeds of $4.6 million. No gain was recognized under this transaction since the accounting adjustment to the carrying amount of the 2006 Notes of $4.6 million is treated as a premium and will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of the 2006 Notes (through June 15, 2006). Prior to the termination of the interest rate swap agreement, the Company recognized settlement income of $1.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, for the quarters ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, which offset the Company's interest expense for these periods. For the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, the Company recognized settlement income of $2.9 million and $3.9 million, respectively.
 
Cash Flow Hedges
 
The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt under its revolving credit facility. The swap agreements were contracts to exchange variable-rate for fixed-rate interest payments without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts.
 
In September 2002, the Company terminated and settled its $150.0 million and $50.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreements with original expiration dates of October 17, 2003 and October 17, 2006, respectively. At termination, the Company paid $17.6 million, of which $1.8 million was accrued interest and the remaining $15.8 million represented the fair value of the swap agreements at the time of termination. The fair value of the swap agreements was reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized as a reduction to investment income on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the original expiration dates of the interest rate swap agreements or the expected cash flows of the commercial paper program. The fair value of the $150.0 million and $50.0 million notional amount swap agreements, at termination, were $8.0 million and $7.8 million, respectively. Amortization of other comprehensive income related to the terminated swaps on a pre-tax basis for the quarters ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 totaled $0.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively, and $0.3 million and $1.4 million on an after-tax basis for the same periods, respectively. Amortization of other comprehensive income related to the terminated swaps on a pre-tax basis for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 totaled $1.0 million and $4.7
 
 
 
million, respectively, and $0.6 million and $2.8 million on an after-tax basis for the same periods, respectively.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2003, the fair value of the $150.0 million notional amount swap agreement in other comprehensive income was fully amortized. The unamortized pre-tax amount in other comprehensive income related to the $50.0 million notional amount swap agreement as of June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003 totaled $4.4 million and $5.4 million, respectively.
 
 
The following is an illustration of the dilutive effect of the Company's potential Common Stock on earnings per share. Outstanding stock options for which the exercise price was greater than the average market per share price of Common Stock were 75,000 and 410,000, for the quarters ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and 1,114,000 and 523,000, for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Since the effect of these options was antidilutive, they have been excluded from the computation of the diluted earnings per share below.
 
 
 
 
The following summarizes comprehensive (loss) income reclassification adjustments for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003:
 
 
 
The Company maintains the following two reportable segments: Health Care and Specialty. The Health Care segment, prior to the acquisition of Cobalt, was an aggregation of four operating segments: California, Central, Georgia and Senior/State-Sponsored Programs. With the acquisition of Cobalt on September 24, 2003, the Health Care segment increased to five operating segments with the addition of the Wisconsin region. These Health Care operating segments all have similar characteristics and meet the following five aggregation criteria as defined under paragraph 17 of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" ("SFAS No. 131"):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company's focus on regional concentration allows management to understand and meet customer needs while effectively managing the cost structure. The Company's chief operating decision maker (Chief Executive Officer) reviews the results of operations on a regular basis and holds each Division President accountable for his or her segment's operating results. These operating segments composing the Health Care segment provide a broad spectrum of network-based health plans, including PPOs, HMOs, POS plans, other hybrid plans and traditional indemnity plans, to large and small employers and individuals as well as other health care-related products, such as vision, preventive care, COBRA and flexible benefits account administration. The Specialty business is maintained as a separate segment providing an array of specialty products, including pharmacy benefits management, dental, life insurance, disability insurance, behavioral health, workers' compensation insurance products and workers' compensation managed care services. Amounts under the heading "Corporate and Other" include net investment income, general and administrative expense and interest expense not allocable to the reportable segments. Also included in Corporate and Other are the operating results from the Company's captive general insurance agency and other non-core strategic businesses, which have not met the quantitative thresholds for an operating segment under SFAS No. 131.
 
The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The following tables present segment information for the Health Care and Specialty segments for the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003.
 
Intersegment revenues include internal pharmaceutical sales by the Company's mail order pharmacy to the Health Care segment's members, utilization review fees (primarily related to behavioral health services) and claims and rebate processing fees recognized by the Specialty segment for pharmacy benefit management services provided to the Health Care segment. For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2004, pharmaceutical sales totaled $120.0 million and $232.0 million, respectively, and utilization review fees and claims and rebate processing fees totaled $23.7 million and $47.0 million, respectively. For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2003, pharmaceutical sales totaled $105.7 million and $198.8 million, respectively, and utilization review fees and claims and rebate processing fees totaled $21.2 million and $42.8 million, respectively. All intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation under the caption "Corporate and Other."

In December 2000, the Company formed the WellPoint Foundation (the "Foundation"), a non-profit organization exempt from federal taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of the Foundation is to improve the health and well-being of individuals in the communities served by the Company and its subsidiaries. The Foundation's Board of Directors is composed solely of persons who are also officers of the Company. No commitments and contributions were made to the Foundation during the quarter ended June 30, 2004. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, the Company committed and contributed $15.0 million to the Foundation. For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2003, the Company committed and contributed $10.0 million and $20.0 million, respectively, to the Foundation. As of June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the Company did not have any outstanding commitments payable to the Foundation. The Company currently has no legal obligations for any future commitments to the Foundation.
 
 
From time to time, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings, many of which involve claims for coverage encountered in the ordinary course of business. The Company, like HMOs and health insurers generally, excludes certain health care services from coverage under its HMO, PPO and other plans. The Company is, in its ordinary course of business, subject to the claims of its enrollees arising out of decisions to restrict treatment or reimbursement for certain services. The loss of even one such claim, if it results in a significant punitive damage award, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, the risk of potential liability under punitive damage theories may increase significantly the difficulty of obtaining reasonable settlements of coverage claims.
 
In May 2000, the California Medical Association filed a lawsuit in U.S. district court in San Francisco against BCC. The lawsuit alleges that BCC violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ("RICO") through various misrepresentations to and inappropriate
 
 
 
actions against health care providers. In late 1999, a number of class-action lawsuits were brought against several of the Company's competitors alleging, among other things, various misrepresentations regarding their health plans and breaches of fiduciary obligations to health plan members. In August 2000, the Company was added as a party to , a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of health care providers nationwide. In addition to the RICO claims brought in the California Medical Association lawsuit, this lawsuit also alleges violations of ERISA, federal and state "prompt pay" regulations and certain common law claims. In October 2000, the federal Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order consolidating the California Medical Association lawsuit, the lawsuit and various other pending managed care class-action lawsuits against other companies before District Court Judge Federico Moreno in the Southern District of Florida for purposes of the pretrial proceedings. In March 2001, Judge Moreno dismissed the plaintiffs' claims based on violation of RICO, although the dismissal was made without prejudice to the plaintiffs' ability to subsequently refile their claims. Judge Moreno also dismissed, with prejudice, the plaintiffs' federal prompt pay law claims. On March 26, 2001, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in its lawsuit, alleging, among other things, revised RICO claims and violations of California law. On May 3, 2001, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On May 9, 2001, Judge Moreno issued an order requiring that all discovery in the litigation be completed by December 2001, with the exception of discovery related to expert witnesses, which was to be completed by March 15, 2002. In June 2001, the federal Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit issued a stay of Judge Moreno's discovery order, pending a hearing before the Court of Appeals on the Company's appeal of its motion to compel arbitration (which had earlier been granted in part and denied in part by Judge Moreno). The hearing was held in January 2002 and, in March 2002, the Court of Appeals panel issued an opinion affirming Judge Moreno's earlier action with respect to the motion to compel arbitration. The Company filed a motion requesting a rehearing of the matter before the entire 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which motion was denied by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in June 2002. On July 29, 2002, Judge Moreno issued an order providing that discovery in the case would be allowed to re-commence on September 30, 2002. On September 26, 2002, Judge Moreno issued an additional order certifying a nationwide class of physicians in the matter, setting a trial date in May 2003 and ordering the parties to participate in non-binding mediation. In October 2002, the defendants, among other things, moved to compel arbitration of most claims (which motion was granted in part in September 2003). In October 2002, the Company also filed a motion with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals seeking to appeal Judge Moreno's class-certification order. The motion was granted. The 11th Circuit heard oral argument on September 11, 2003 on the Company's appeal. A mediator has been appointed by Judge Moreno and the parties are currently conducting court-ordered mediation. On April 30, 2004, Judge Moreno set a new trial date in March 2005 and extended the deadline for expert discovery to September 29, 2004, which may be further extended.

In March 2002, the American Dental Association and three individual dentists filed a lawsuit in U.S. district court in Chicago against the Company and BCC. This lawsuit alleges that WellPoint and BCC engaged in conduct that constituted a breach of contract under ERISA,
 
 
 
trade libel and tortious interference with contractual relations and existing and prospective business expectancies. The lawsuit seeks class-action status. The Company filed a motion (which was granted in July 2002) with the federal Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation requesting that the proceedings in this case be consolidated with a similar action brought against other managed care companies that has been consolidated with the lawsuit. The case is currently stayed.

On March 26, 2003, a lawsuit entitled . was filed in the California Superior Court in Alameda County, California. WellPoint and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries are named as defendants in the lawsuit. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated California Business and Professions Code Section 17200 by engaging in unfair, fraudulent and unlawful business practices. The complaint alleges, among other things, that pharmacy benefit management companies (such as the Company's subsidiary that does business under the tradename WellPoint Pharmacy Management) engage in unfair practices such as negotiating discounts in prices of drugs from pharmacies and negotiating rebates from drug manufacturers and retaining such discounts and rebates for their own benefit. The complaint also alleges that drugs are included in formularies in exchange for rebates and that the defendants charge patient co-payments that exceed the actual cost of generic drugs.

In early 2003, a lawsuit entitled was filed in U.S. District Court in Oregon. This litigation has subsequently been transferred to Judge Moreno of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. This litigation is a putative class action lawsuit on behalf of chiropractors in the western United States. The Company is a named defendant in the lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges that each of the defendants engaged in similar activities and conduct as that alleged in the litigation. The case is currently stayed.

In October 2003, a lawsuit entitled was filed in the U.S. District Court in the Southern District in Florida. The Company is a named defendant in this lawsuit. This lawsuit is also a putative class action brought on behalf of chiropractors, podiatrists and certain other types of health care practitioners nationwide. This lawsuit also alleges that the defendants engaged in similar activities and conduct as that alleged in the litigation. On December 15, 2003, this lawsuit was transferred to Judge Moreno, and the case was

In December 2003, the plaintiffs in filed a similar lawsuit against the Company, the Company's Blue Cross and Blue Shield-licensed subsidiaries, the BCBSA and all of the other current Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensees. The lawsuit is entitled and was filed in the U.S. District Court in the Southern District in Florida. On January 7, 2004, this lawsuit was transferred to Judge Moreno. On March 9, 2004, Judge Moreno issued an order restoring this case to the active docket and placing it on a coordinated track with the lawsuit.

The financial and operational impact that these and other evolving theories of recovery will have on the managed care industry generally, or the Company in particular, is at present unknown.
 
Prior to the Company's acquisition of the GBO, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company ("John Hancock") entered into a number of reinsurance arrangements with respect to personal accident insurance and the occupational accident component of workers' compensation insurance, a portion of which was originated through a pool managed by Unicover Managers, Inc. Under these arrangements, John Hancock assumed risks as a reinsurer and transferred certain of such risks to other companies. These arrangements have become the subject of disputes, including a number of legal proceedings to which John Hancock is a party. The Company is currently in arbitration with John Hancock regarding these arrangements. The Company believes that it has a number of defenses to avoid any ultimate liability with respect to these matters and believes that such liabilities were not transferred to the Company as part of the GBO acquisition. However, if the Company were to become subject to such liabilities, the Company could suffer losses that might have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
 
A stockholder class action lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of Ventura County, California on October 28, 2003 against the Company and its board of directors. The lawsuit, which is entitled , alleges that the Company's directors breached their fiduciary duties to stockholders by approving an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Anthem while in possession of non-public information regarding the Company's financial results for the third quarter of 2003. The lawsuit seeks to enjoin the Company from consummating the merger with Anthem, unless the Company adopts and implements a process for obtaining the highest possible price for stockholders, and to rescind any terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger that have already been implemented. On May 7, 2004, WellPoint and the plaintiff signed a memorandum of understanding regarding a potential settlement of the action. The potential settlement contemplated by the memorandum of understanding involves WellPoint agreeing to provide certain additional disclosures on several matters in the joint proxy statement/prospectus sent to WellPoint's stockholders beyond those contained in the preliminary proxy statement/prospectus. The settlement would also provide for the payment by WellPoint of $2.25 million to the plaintiff's counsel for fees and
Abrams v. WellPoint Health Networks Inc., et al.
 
 
 
costs (subject to court approval). No part of the settlement costs will be paid by the WellPoint directors individually. The settlement would not involve any admissions of breaches of fiduciary duty or other wrongdoing by WellPoint or any of its directors. The settlement and payment of the plaintiff's counsel fees would be conditioned upon, among other things, completion of the merger. Any final settlement agreement signed by the parties must be approved by the Superior Court judge assigned to the matter. While WellPoint expects to diligently negotiate the terms of a final settlement agreement, there can be no assurances that a settlement agreement will be signed.
 
Certain of such legal proceedings are or may be covered under insurance policies or indemnification agreements. Based upon information presently available, the Company believes that the final outcome of all such proceedings should not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
 
The Company and its subsidiaries are party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business that contain standard indemnity provisions obligating the Company or such subsidiary to indemnify third parties for certain costs and expenses incurred by such parties in connection with such agreements. These agreements include, for example, vendor contracts, underwriting and loan agreements, consulting agreements and agreements for other services, such as custodial arrangements with respect to certain of the Company's assets. The maximum amount of potential future payments pursuant to these standard indemnity provisions cannot be estimated because the amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred by the indemnified parties is unknown.
 
In connection with the formation in 2000 of a joint venture providing Medicaid services in Puerto Rico, the Company agreed under certain circumstances to provide additional funds to the joint-venture entity. The Company agreed that it would make a capital contribution to the joint venture of up to 80% of any amount necessary to increase the entity's capital to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements if (i) applicable law or regulation requires an increase in the entity's capital and the entity does not then have capital sufficient to meet the increased requirement or (ii) the entity's medical care ratio is 100% or greater during any 180-day period and the entity does not then meet statutory capital requirements under the Puerto Rico Insurance Code. The amount of this guarantee will not exceed 80% of the amount necessary to provide the entity with a 12 to 1 premium-to-capital ratio. As of June 30, 2004, the Company's maximum potential liability pursuant to this guarantee was $26.9 million. Since the formation of the joint venture in 2000, the Company has not been required to make any payments under this guarantee and the Company does not currently expect that any such payments will be made.
 
As partial consideration for the Company's acquisition of Health Core (see Note 6), the Company agreed to make contingent payments up to $5.5 million based on Health Core achieving certain financial performance targets during 2005, 2006 and 2007.
 
 
 
On June 9, 2004, the Company agreed to pay up to $2 million per year for up to four years to a laboratory service provider if certain of the Company's subsidiaries enter into contracts to obtain services from such provider and the volume of laboratory service expenditures under those contracts for the years 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 do not exceed specified targets.
 
In connection with an investment in July 2004 in a joint venture to develop and operate a well-being center in California, the Company may be required to make an additional capital contribution of up to $18 million during the first three years that the well-being center is in operation if cash flows and occupancy rates do not exceed specified targets. It is currently anticipated that construction of the California well-being center will be completed in December 2005.
 
On July 15, 2004, the Company agreed to guarantee up to $37 million of debt incurred by an unaffiliated entity to partially finance the purchase of a hospital. The maximum amount of the guaranty may be reduced after September 30, 2006 as determined by reference to the leverage ratio (as defined in the guaranty) of the unaffiliated entity. The guaranty also provides for full payment of all obligations under the guaranty to become immediately due and payable under specified circumstances, including (i) upon the failure by the unaffiliated entity or the Company to cure any payment default under the subject loan to the unaffiliated entity within 10 days after written notice to the unaffiliated entity and the Company and (ii) upon 10 days after written notice to the Company that the unaffiliated entity has become subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding. In connection with the guaranty, the unaffiliated entity and the Company entered into a reimbursement agreement pursuant to which the unaffiliated entity agreed to reimburse the Company upon demand for any amounts paid by the Company under the guaranty. The obligations of the unaffiliated entity under the reimbursement agreement are secured by a second lien on certain real estate collateral. In addition, the parent company of the unaffiliated entity has provided a guaranty in favor of the Company guaranteeing the obligations of the unaffiliated entity under the reimbursement agreement.
 
 
On October 26, 2003, WellPoint entered into a merger agreement with Anthem, Inc. ("Anthem"). The consideration to be received by the stockholders of WellPoint will be composed of $23.80 in cash and one share of Anthem common stock per share of WellPoint Common Stock. Based on the closing price of Anthem's common stock on October 24, 2003, the transaction was valued at approximately $16.4 billion. Upon completion of this transaction, WellPoint will merge into a wholly owned subsidiary of Anthem and Anthem will change its name to WellPoint, Inc. Anthem, a publicly traded company, is an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and holds the exclusive right to use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in the states of Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Colorado, Nevada, Maine and Virginia, excluding the immediate suburbs of Washington D.C. As of June 30, 2004, Anthem provided health care benefits to more than 12.6 million medical members, which includes BlueCard "host" members. Headquartered in
 
 
 
Indianapolis, Indiana, Anthem, along with its subsidiaries, offers a diverse portfolio of complementary health and group life insurance, managed care products, pharmacy benefit management and government health program administration. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among other things, approval of WellPoint's and Anthem's shareholders and various regulatory agencies. At separate meetings held on June 28, 2004, the Company's and Anthem's stockholders approved the transaction. On July 23, 2004, the California Department of Insurance (the "DOI") announced that it was disapproving Anthem's application (known as a "Form A") to acquire control of the Company's subsidiary, BC Life & Health Insurance Company, in connection with the transaction. The DOI's approval was the final regulatory approval necessary to complete the merger. On August 3, 2004, Anthem filed a petition for writ of mandate in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, challenging the DOI's denial and asking the court to overturn the DOI's decision. There can be no assurances regarding the outcome of this lawsuit. It is not currently known when the transaction will close or if the parties will obtain all approvals necessary to complete the merger.
 
 
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
WellPoint Health Networks Inc.
 
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of WellPoint Health Networks Inc. and its subsidiaries as of June 30, 2004, and the related consolidated income statements for each of the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statement of changes in stockholders' equity for the six-month period ended June 30, 2004 and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2004 and 2003. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
 
We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
 
Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
 
We previously audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2003, and the related consolidated income statement and consolidated changes in stockholders' equity, and of cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated January 27, 2004 we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Our report included an explanatory paragraph, that effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, . Accordingly, the Company ceased amortizing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of January 1, 2002. Additionally, effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, Accordingly, the Company reclassified an extraordinary loss related to the extinguishment of debt to interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2002. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as of December 31, 2003 is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
of WellPoint Health Networks Inc.
 
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated income statements and consolidated statements of changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of WellPoint Health Networks Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
As discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, . Accordingly, the Company ceased amortizing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of January 1, 2002. Additionally, as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, . Accordingly, the Company reclassified an extraordinary loss related to the extinguishment of debt to interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2002.

WellPoint Health Networks Inc. (the "Company" or "WellPoint") is one of the nation's largest publicly traded managed health care companies. As of December 31, 2003, WellPoint had approximately 15.0 million medical members (including approximately 1.0 million BlueCard "host" members) and approximately 45.6 million specialty members. Through its subsidiaries, the Company offers a broad spectrum of network-based managed care plans to the large and small employer, individual, Medicaid and senior markets. The Company's managed care plans include preferred provider organizations ("PPOs"), health maintenance organizations ("HMOs"), point-of-service ("POS") plans, other hybrid plans and traditional indemnity plans. In addition, the Company offers managed care services, including underwriting, actuarial services, network access, medical management and claims processing. The Company also provides a broad array of specialty and other products and services including pharmacy benefits management, dental, vision, life insurance, preventive care, disability insurance, behavioral health, COBRA and flexible benefits account administration. With its recent acquisition of Cobalt Corporation, the Company now also offers workers' compensation insurance products and is currently the largest Medicare Part A fiscal intermediary in the nation, processing claims for providers in all 50 states. The Company markets its products in California primarily under the name Blue Cross of California, in Georgia primarily under the name Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia, in various parts of Missouri (including the greater St. Louis area) primarily under the name Blue Cross Blue Shield of Missouri, in Wisconsin primarily under the names Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wisconsin and CompcareBlue and in various parts of the country under the names UNICARE and HealthLink. These products are marketed by the Company's various operating subsidiaries throughout the United States. The Company's customer base is diversified, with extensive membership among large and small employer groups and individuals and in the Medicare and Medicaid markets.
 
 
As a managed health care organization, the Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Health Care Organizations. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Such policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and have been consistently applied. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for each reporting period. The significant estimates made in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements relate to the assessment of the carrying value of investments, goodwill and intangible assets, medical claims payable and reserves for future policy benefits. While the Company believes that the carrying value of such assets and liabilities is adequate as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, actual results could differ from the estimates upon which the carrying values were based.
 
Principles of Consolidation
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
Cash Equivalents
 
The Company considers cash equivalents to include highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original remaining maturity of three months or less.
 
Concentration of Credit Risk
 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, bonds and interest rate swap agreements. The Company invests its excess cash primarily in commercial paper and money market funds. Although a majority of the cash accounts exceed the federally insured deposit amount, management does not anticipate nonperformance by financial institutions and reviews the financial viability of these institutions on a periodic basis. The Company attempts to limit its risk in investment securities by maintaining a diversified portfolio. The components of investment securities are shown in Note 4.
 
Investments
 
Investment securities consist primarily of U.S. Treasury and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, investment grade and non-investment grade corporate bonds, equity securities and venture capital. The Company has determined that its investment securities are available for use in current operations and, accordingly, has classified such investment securities as current assets without regard to contractual maturity dates.
 
Long-term investments consist primarily of restricted assets, certain equities and other investments. Restricted assets, at market value, included in long-term investments at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $116.0 million and $104.0 million, respectively, and consisted primarily of investments on deposit with the California Department of Managed Health Care ("DMHC"). These deposits consisted primarily of U.S. Treasury and agency securities. Due to their restricted nature, such investments are classified as long-term without regard to contractual maturity dates.
 
The Company has determined that its debt and equity securities are available-for-sale. Debt and equity securities are carried at estimated fair value based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments. Unrealized gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income, net of applicable deferred income taxes. Realized gains and losses on the disposition of investments are included in investment income. The first in-first out method is used in determining the cost of debt and equity securities sold.
 
The Company evaluates all of its investments based on current market prices and economic conditions, declining market valuation and financial condition of the issuer. Investments that have declines in fair value below cost, which are judged to be other-than-temporary, are written down to estimated fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded write-downs of approximately $31.2 million, $41.9 million and $21.1 million, respectively, related to these declines.
 
The Company participates in securities lending programs whereby marketable securities in the Company's portfolio are transferred to an independent broker or dealer in exchange for collateral initially equal to at least 102% of the market value of securities on loan. The broker or dealer is required to deliver additional collateral if the market value of the collateral initially delivered falls below 100% of the market value of securities on loan.
 
Hedging Activities
 
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 133"). SFAS No. 133, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133" and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133," establishes the accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 133, all derivatives must be recognized on the balance sheet at their then fair value. Any deferred gains and losses remaining on the balance sheet under previous hedge-accounting rules must be removed from the balance sheet and all hedging relationships must be designated anew and documented pursuant to the new accounting. The SFAS No. 133 was adopted in the first quarter of 2001.
 
The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a pre-tax increase to other income of $0.1 million and an after-tax decrease to other comprehensive income of $4.2 million.
 
The Company uses derivative instruments, specifically interest rate swap agreements, to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates. The principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with financing and investing activities. The Company manages exposure to market risk associated with interest rate contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in interest rates. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions with which the Company also has other financial relationships. These counterparties expose the Company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.
 
Interest rate swap agreements are contracts to exchange fixed interest rate payments for variable interest rate payments or to exchange variable interest rate payments for fixed interest rate payments periodically over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. The notional amounts of the interest rate swap agreements are used to measure interest to be paid. For interest rate instruments that effectively hedge interest rate exposures, the net cash amounts paid on the agreements are accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense. If an agreement no longer qualifies as a hedge instrument, then it is marked to market and carried on the balance sheet at fair value. The change in fair value of these instruments is included in investment income. (See Note 12 for further discussion of the Company's Hedging Activities.)
 
The Company has used derivative instruments, in particular, forward exchange contracts, to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with its foreign currency denominated investment portfolio. Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge the foreign currency risk between trade date and settlement date of foreign currency investment transactions. Gains and losses from such instruments are recognized in the Company's income statement at the settlement date.
 
Forward exchange contracts have also been used to hedge asset positions in foreign currency denominated securities. The unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, from such forward contracts and related hedging investments are reflected in other comprehensive income at the balance sheet dates. As of December 31, 2001, the Company no longer invested in foreign currency denominated securities.
 
Premiums Receivable
 
Premiums receivable are shown net of an allowance based on historical collection trends and management's judgment on the collectibility of these accounts. These collection trends, as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, are routinely monitored by management and any adjustments required are reflected in current operations.
 
Property and Equipment, Net
 
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation, and are depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are stated net of amortization and are amortized over a period not exceeding the term of the lease. Upon disposal of property and equipment, the cost of the asset and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts while the resulting gain or loss is reflected in current operations.
 
Certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal-use software are capitalized in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use." Internal computer software costs that are incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Direct consulting costs, payroll and payroll related cost for employees, incurred during the development stage, who are directly associated with each project are capitalized and amortized over a five-year period when placed into production.
 
Intangible Assets and Goodwill, Net
 
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS No. 141") and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS No. 142"). SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method. The provisions of SFAS No. 141 also apply to all business combinations consummated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142, which became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, eliminates amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Rather, these assets are subject to impairment tests at least annually. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are being amortized using a straight-line basis or the timing of related cash flows over periods ranging from 1.5 to 25 years. An intangible asset subject to amortization must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" (See Note 7 for further discussion of the Company's intangible assets and goodwill.)
 
The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002 and no longer amortizes goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company completed the transitional evaluation of its goodwill and other intangible assets at January 1, 2002 and the annual evaluation at December 31, 2003 and 2002 and determined that there was no impairment loss.
 
Medical Claims Payable
 
Medical claims payable include claims in process as well as provisions for the estimate of incurred but not reported claims and provisions for disputed claims obligations. Such estimates are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider, among other things, contractual requirements, historical utilization trends and payment patterns, benefits changes, medical inflation, product mix, seasonality, membership and other relevant factors. In developing its best estimate of medical claims payable, the Company consistently applies the principles and assumptions listed above from year to year, while also giving due consideration to the potential variability of these factors. Because medical claims payable includes various actuarially developed estimates, the Company's actual health care services expense may be more or less than the Company's previously developed estimates. Claim processing expenses are also accrued based on an estimate of expenses necessary to process such claims. Such reserves are continually monitored and reviewed, with any adjustments reflected in current operations. (See Note 8 for further discussion of the Company's medical claims payable.)
 
Capitation costs represent monthly fees paid one month in advance to physicians, certain other medical service providers and hospitals in the Company's HMO networks as retainers for providing continuing medical care. The Company maintains various programs that provide incentives to physicians, certain other medical service providers and hospitals participating in its HMO networks through the use of risk-sharing agreements and other programs. Payments under such agreements are made based on the providers' performance in managing health care costs while providing quality health care. Expenses related to these programs, which are based in part on estimates, are recorded in the period in which the related services are rendered. Management believes that its reserves for medical claims payable are adequate to satisfy its ultimate claim liability. However, these estimates are inherently subject to a number of highly variable circumstances. Consequently, the actual results could differ materially from the amount recorded in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
 
The Company's future results of operations will depend in part on its ability to predict and manage health care costs through underwriting criteria, medical management, product design and negotiation of favorable provider and hospital contracts. The Company's ability to contain such costs may be adversely affected by changes in utilization rates, demographic characteristics, the regulatory environment, health care practices, inflation, new technologies, clusters of high-cost cases, continued consolidation of physician, hospital and other provider groups, acts of terrorism and bioterrorism or other catastrophes, including war and numerous other factors. The Company's inability to mitigate any or all of the above-listed or other factors may adversely affect the Company's future profitability.
 
Reserves for Future Policy Benefits
 
The estimate of reserves for future policy benefits relates to life and disability insurance policies written in connection with health care contracts. Reserves for future life benefit coverage are based on projections of past experience. Reserves for future policy and contract benefits for certain long-term disability products and group paid-up life products are based upon interest, mortality and morbidity assumptions from published actuarial tables, modified based upon the Company's experience. Reserves are continually monitored and reviewed, and as settlements are made or reserves adjusted, differences are reflected in current operations. The current portion of reserves for future policy benefits relates to the portion of such reserves that the Company expects to pay within one year. The Company believes that its reserves for future policy benefits are adequate to satisfy its ultimate benefit liability. However, these estimates are inherently subject to a number of highly variable circumstances. Consequently, the actual results could differ materially from the amount recorded in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
 
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
 
Pension and other Postretirement Benefits represents outstanding obligations for certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees and their dependents and unfunded liabilities related to pension benefits under plans administered by the Company. The Company accrues the estimated costs of retiree health and other postretirement benefits during the periods in which eligible employees render service to earn the benefits, which is in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." Unfunded liabilities for pension benefits are accrued in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions." (See Note 10 for further discussion of the Company's Pension and Post Retirement Benefits.)
 
Income Taxes
 
The Company's provision for income taxes reflects the current and future tax consequences of all events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements as measured by the provision of currently enacted tax laws and rates applicable to future periods.
 
Acquired deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for an acquired entity's prior tax returns at the date of purchase are based on management's best estimate of the ultimate settlement that will be accepted by the tax authorities. At the date of a change in management's best estimate of items relating to an acquired entity's prior tax returns, and at the date that the items are settled with the tax authorities, any liability previously recognized is adjusted to increase or decrease the remaining balance of goodwill attributable to that acquisition.
 
Recognition of Premium Revenue and Management Services and Other Revenue
 
For most health care and life insurance contracts, premiums are billed in advance of coverage periods and are recognized as revenue over the period in which services or benefits are obligated to be provided. Premiums include revenue from other contracts, which principally relate to minimum premium contracts, where revenue is recognized based upon the ultimate loss experience of the contract. These contracts obligate the Company to arrange for the provision of health care for the members covered by the related contract and exposes the Company to financial risk based upon its ability to manage health care costs below a contractual fixed attachment point. Premium revenue includes an adjustment for experience rated refunds based on an estimate of incurred claims. Experience rated refunds are paid based on contractual requirements.
 
The Company's group life and disability insurance contracts are traditional insurance contracts, which are typically issued in conjunction with a health care contract. Additionally, WellPoint has a limited number of indemnity health insurance contracts. All of these contracts provide insurance protection for a fixed period ranging from one month to a year. There is no specified commitment period for individual members under the health, life and disability contracts. Since the Company assumes the risk of both medical and administrative costs for its members in return for premium revenue, contracts with overdue payments are generally automatically cancelled to the extent permitted under applicable law. For small and large employer groups, the commitment period is generally one year. The Company has the ability, at a minimum, to adjust the provisions of the contract at the end of
 
the contract period. As a result, the Company's insurance contracts are considered short-duration contracts. Premiums applicable to the unexpired contractual coverage periods are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as unearned premiums.
 
Management services revenue is earned as services are performed and consists of administrative fees for services provided to third parties, including management of medical services, claims processing and access to provider networks. Under administrative service contracts, self-funded employers retain the full risk of financing benefits. Funds received from employers are equal to amounts required to fund benefit expenses and pay earned administrative fees. Because benefit expenses are not the obligation of the Company, premium revenue and benefit expenses for these contracts are not included in the Company's financial statements. Administrative service fees received from employer groups are included in the Company's revenues. Revenues from PrecisionRx, a mail order pharmacy acquired in December 2000, are shown net of pharmaceutical costs. Gross pharmaceutical sales for Precision Rx (including sales to internal customers) for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $433.3 million, $308.1 million and $200.3 million, respectively. The pharmaceutical costs for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $381.0 million, $278.3 million and $186.8 million, respectively.
 
The Company owns a pharmacy benefit management company, which generates revenues by administering pharmacy benefits for the Company as well as other external health plan sponsors. When filling a prescription at a rental pharmacy, the member generally pays a copayment to the retail pharmacy. The Company does not record the copayments as part of its revenue or costs.
 
Loss Contracts
 
The Company monitors its contracts for the provision of medical care and recognizes losses on those contracts when it is probable that expected future health care and maintenance costs, under a group of existing contracts, will exceed anticipated future premiums on those contracts. The estimation of future health care medical costs includes all costs related to the provision of health care to members covered by the related group of contracts. In determining whether a loss has been incurred, the Company reviews contracts either individually or collectively, depending upon the Company's method of establishing premium rates for such contracts.
 
The Company further monitors its life insurance contracts and recognizes losses on those contracts for which estimated future claims costs and maintenance costs exceed the related unearned premium.
 
Health Care Services and Other Benefits
 
Health care services and other benefits expense includes the costs of health care services, capitation expenses and expenses related to risk sharing agreements with participating physicians, medical groups and hospitals and incurred losses on the disability and life products. The costs of health care services are accrued as services are rendered, including an estimate for claims incurred but not yet reported.
 
Acquisition Costs
 
Acquisition costs are those costs, such as commissions and other costs, that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance contracts. Commissions paid to outside brokers and agents representing the Company associated with health contracts are not deferred,
 
but rather, expensed as incurred in accordance with the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Health Care Organizations. The Company's life and disability product offerings have traditional insurance aspects, which require consideration under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 60, "Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises" ("SFAS No. 60"). These products, however, are primarily offered to large group employers where selling expense is not incremental because the Company's existing staff supports all marketing efforts and, therefore, the selling expense of these products does not qualify for deferral under SFAS No. 60.
 
Advertising Costs
 
The Company uses print and broadcast advertising to promote its products. The cost of advertising is expensed as incurred and totaled approximately $78.6 million, $76.3 million and $59.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
 
Earnings Per Share
 
Basic earnings per share is computed excluding the impact of potential Common Stock and earnings per share assuming full dilution is computed including the impact of potential Common Stock.
 
Stock Split
 
On March 15, 2002, WellPoint effected a two-for-one split of the Company's Common Stock. The stock split was in the form of a stock dividend of one additional share of WellPoint Common Stock for each share outstanding. Except for the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity, all share and per share data for all periods presented herein have been adjusted to give effect to the stock split.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
As of December 31, 2003, the Company had three stock-based employee compensation plans: the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2000 Employee Stock Option Plan and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company accounts for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and related FASB interpretations. Accordingly, compensation cost for stock options under existing plans is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the Company's Common Stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income related to stock options granted because options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying Common Stock on the date of grant. In addition, no compensation expense is recorded for purchases under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan in accordance with APB No. 25. Employee stock-based compensation included in reported net income includes restricted stock awards being amortized over the award's vesting period.
 
The following table illustrates the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" as amended by Statement of Financial
 
Accounting Standards No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure" for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.
 
 
The above pro forma disclosures may not be representative of the effects on reported pro forma net income for future years. (See Note 15 for information regarding activity in the Company's stock plans and the assumptions used in the fair value based method depicted above.)
 
Comprehensive Income
 
Comprehensive income encompasses all changes in stockholders' equity (except those arising from transactions with stockholders) and includes net income and net unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities, foreign currency adjustments and adjustments to minimum pension liabilities. Other comprehensive income is net of reclassification adjustments to adjust for items currently included in net income, such as realized gains on investment securities.
 
Reclassifications
 
Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to 2003 have been reclassified to conform to the 2003 presentation.
 
New Accounting Pronouncements
 
In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections" ("SFAS No. 145"). With the rescission of FASB Statement No. 4, gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in APB Opinion No. 30. The provisions of APB Opinion No. 30 distinguish between transactions that are part of an entity's recurring operations and those that are unusual or infrequent or that meet the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item. The provisions of SFAS No. 145 related to the rescission of FASB Statement No. 4 are required to be applied for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. The Company has determined that the extinguishment of debt under its Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Debentures, which were redeemed as of October 28, 2002, does not meet the requirements of unusual or infrequent and
 
therefore would not be included as an extraordinary item with the rescission of FASB Statement No. 4. For the year ended December 31, 2002, WellPoint reclassified an extraordinary loss of $6.3 million, which included a tax benefit of $2.5 million, to interest expense. The adoption of the other provisions of SFAS No. 145 did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" ("FIN No. 45"). FIN No. 45 requires that upon issuance of certain guarantees, a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation assumed under the guarantee. The recognition provisions of FIN No. 45 are effective for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Refer to Note 20 regarding the Company's joint venture providing Medicaid services in Puerto Rico. The adoption of FIN No. 45 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
 
In December 2002, the FASB amended the transition and disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS No. 123"), through the issuance of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure" ("SFAS No. 148"). SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosures that a company is required to make in its annual and interim financial statements. These disclosures are required regardless of whether a company is using the intrinsic value method under APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" or the fair value based method under SFAS No. 123 to account for its stock-based employee compensation. SFAS No. 148 also provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS No. 148 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The Company plans to continue to account for stock-based employee compensation under the intrinsic value-based method.
 
In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entitiesan interpretation of ARB No. 51" ("FIN No. 46"). FIN No. 46 expands upon existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in financial statements the assets, liabilities and activities of another entity. FIN No. 46 requires an enterprise to consolidate a variable interest entity if that enterprise has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity's expected losses, receive a majority of the entity's expected residual returns or both. This interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created or obtained after January 31, 2003. For those variable interest entities in existence prior to January 31, 2003, the consolidation provisions of FIN No. 46 are effective July 1, 2003. In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entitiesan interpretation of ARB No. 51" ("FIN No. 46R"). FIN No. 46R clarifies some of the provisions of FIN No. 46 and exempts certain entities from its requirements. FIN No. 46R is effective at the end of the interim period ending after March 15, 2004 for variable interest entities other than special purpose entities. The adoption of FIN No. 46 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company believes the adoption of FIN No. 46R will not have a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position.
 
In April 2003, the FASB amended and clarified financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 133"), through the issuance of Statement of Financial Accounting
 
Standards No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 149"). SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 149 did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
 
In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS No. 150"). SFAS No. 150 modifies the accounting for certain financial instruments that, under previous guidance, issuers could account for as equity. SFAS No. 150 requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position. Most of the guidance in SFAS No. 150 is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 or otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
 
In December 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132 (revised 2003), "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits-an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106" ("SFAS No. 132R"). SFAS No. 132R retains the disclosure requirements contained in FASB Statement No. 132, "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits" ("SFAS No. 132"), and also requires additional disclosures to those in the original SFAS No. 132 about the assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. Except as noted, disclosures required by SFAS No. 132R are effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. The disclosure of estimated future benefit payments required by SFAS No. 132R is effective for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004. The adoption of SFAS No. 132R did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
 
On December 8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 ("MMA") was signed into law. MMA introduced a voluntary Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit and created a new 28% federal subsidy for the sponsors of the postretirement prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the new Medicare Part D benefit. In January 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106-1, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003" ("FSP FAS 106-1"). Under FSP FAS 106-1, which guidance is based on FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," sponsors must consider the two new features of MMA in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation ("APBO") and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. In accordance with FSP FAS 106-1, the Company made a one-time election to recognize the impact of MMA. Accordingly, any measures of APBO and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the Company's consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes for the year ended December 31, 2003 include the effects of MMA. The adoption of the FSP FAS 106-1 did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Currently, specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and that guidance, when issued, could require the Company to change previously reported information.
 
 
 
 
In 1996, the Company began pursuing a nationwide expansion strategy through selective acquisitions and start-up activities in key geographic areas. More recently, the Company has focused on acquiring businesses that provide significant concentrations of members in strategic locations outside of California. In connection with this strategy, the Company completed its acquisitions of Cobalt Corporation ("Cobalt") in 2003, Methodist Care, Inc. ("MethodistCare") and RightCHOICE Managed Care, Inc. ("RightCHOICE") in 2002 and Cerulean Companies, Inc. ("Cerulean") in 2001.
 
On October 31, 2003, Company completed its acquisition of HealthCore Inc. ("HealthCore"). HealthCore currently provides outcomes research service to health plans and pharmaceutical organizations. The purchase price and related acquisition costs of approximately $4.4 million exceeded the estimated fair value of net assets acquired by $2.9 million. Under the purchase method of accounting, the Company assigned this amount to goodwill. The operating results for HealthCore are included in WellPoint's consolidated income statements for periods following the completion of the acquisition. The pro forma effects of the HealthCore acquisition on the Company's consolidated financial statements were not material and are not included in the pro forma financial information presented below.
 
On September 24, 2003, the Company completed its acquisition of Cobalt, the parent company of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wisconsin. Cobalt served approximately 675,000 medical members (excluding BlueCard members) as of September 30, 2003. The transaction was effective as of September 30, 2003 for accounting purposes. Accordingly, Cobalt's operating results for the fourth quarter of 2003 were included in the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2003.
 
Under the terms of the transaction, total consideration paid to all holders of Cobalt common stock in the merger was approximately $427.5 million in cash and approximately 7.3 million newly issued shares of WellPoint Common Stock (which included approximately 2.1 million shares issued to affiliates). The total purchase price of approximately $884.9 million valued as of September 24, 2003 was used to purchase net assets with a fair value of approximately $252.5 million. Included in the total purchase price was $12.1 million used to retire Cobalt's existing long-term debt at the time of acquisition. As a result of the acquisition of Cobalt, the Company incurred $22.8 million in expenses primarily related to transaction costs. Generally accepted accounting principles require that these expenses, which are not associated with the generation of future revenues and have no future economic benefit, be reflected as assumed liabilities in the allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired. Estimated goodwill and other intangibles totaling $849.1 million includes $96.5 million of deferred tax liabilities relating to identified intangibles. With the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS No. 142"), goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are subject to impairment tests. Identified intangibles with definite useful lives are being amortized on a straight-line basis or the timing of related cash flows depending upon the expected amortization pattern over three to 23 years. The valuation process is not yet complete and, therefore, the allocation between goodwill and intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2003 represents an estimate. As a result, the useful lives and method of amortization are only preliminary estimates. The current estimated purchase price allocation between goodwill and identifiable intangible assets is $607.8 million and $241.3 million, respectively. The entire estimated goodwill amount of $607.8 million is not deductible for tax purposes. The operating results for Cobalt were included in WellPoint's consolidated income statements for
 
periods beginning October 1, 2003. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at date of acquisition.
 
 
 
On June 30, 2003, the Company completed its acquisition of Golden West Health Plan, Inc. ("Golden West") for a purchase price of approximately $30.4 million. Upon completion of the acquisition, Golden West had net assets with a fair value of approximately $0.4 million and served more than 275,000 dental and vision members. With the acquisition of Golden West, WellPoint served approximately 2.9 million dental members nationally as of June 30, 2003. The estimated purchase price allocation between goodwill and identifiable intangible assets was $17.2 million and $13.0 million, respectively. The operating results for Golden West are included in WellPoint's consolidated income statements for periods following the completion of the acquisition.
 
On April 30, 2002, the Company completed its acquisition of MethodistCare, which served over 70,000 members in the Houston, Texas and surrounding areas at the time of acquisition. As a result of the acquisition, the Company recognized an extraordinary gain of $8.9 million, or $0.06 per share assuming full dilution, for the year ended December 31, 2002, due to an excess of the fair value of net assets over acquisition costs. The operating results for MethodistCare are included in WellPoint's consolidated income statement for periods following the completion of the acquisition.
 
On January 31, 2002, WellPoint completed its merger, through its wholly owned subsidiary, RWP Acquisition Corp., with RightCHOICE, the parent company of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Missouri, which served approximately 2.2 million medical members as of January 31, 2002. Under the terms of the transaction, total consideration paid to all holders of RightCHOICE common stock in the merger was $379.1 million in cash and approximately 16.5 million shares of WellPoint Common Stock. The Company issued approximately 11.1 million shares from treasury stock and the remaining 5.4 million shares from newly issued shares of WellPoint Common Stock. The total purchase price of approximately $1,503.7 million was used to purchase net assets with a fair value of approximately $308.8 million. The operating results for RightCHOICE are included in WellPoint's consolidated income statement periods following the completion of the acquisition.
 
In accordance with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS No. 141"), the following unaudited pro forma summary presents revenues, net income and per share data of WellPoint as if the acquisitions of Cobalt, Golden West, MethodistCare and RightCHOICE had occurred on January 1, 2002. The pro forma information includes the results of operations for each acquired entity for the period prior to its acquisition, adjusted for interest expense on long-term debt incurred to fund the acquisitions, amortization of intangible assets with definite useful lives and the related income tax effects.
 
The pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and may not be indicative of the results of operations had the Company been a single entity during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, nor is it necessarily indicative of future results of operations. Pro forma earnings per share are based on 151.3 million and 151.2 million weighted average shares for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Pro forma earnings per share assuming full dilution is based on 156.3 million and 158.9 million weighted average shares for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
 
 
The adjusted pro forma net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes Cobalt's recognition of a net gain from discontinued operations of $6.0 million from its behavioral health and medical management subsidiary, on a pro forma basis, using WellPoint's effective tax rate of 40.0%. In addition, included in net income for the year ended December 31, 2002, was a net after-tax realized gain by Cobalt of $6.7 million, on a pro forma basis, using WellPoint's effective tax rate of 40.0% on the sale of 4.4 million shares of American Medical Security Group, Inc. common stock.

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities as of December 31, 2003, based on contractual maturity dates, are summarized below. Expected maturities for mortgage-backed securities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
 
 
For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, proceeds from the sales and maturities of debt securities were $8,393.8 million, $5,106.6 million and $4,534.7 million, respectively.

Gross gains of $54.2 million and gross losses of $41.6 million were realized on the sales of debt securities for the year ended December 31, 2001. For debt security investments with declines in fair value below cost, which the Company judged to be other than temporary, the Company recorded write-downs of approximately $0.3 million, $27.9 million and $9.0 million, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, proceeds from the sales of equity securities were $601.7 million, $531.9 million and $168.4 million, respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2002, gross realized gains and gross realized losses on the sales of equity securities were $105.7 million and $50.9 million, respectively. Gross gains of $6.4 million and gross losses of $23.3 million were realized on the sales of equity securities for the year ended December 31, 2001. For equity and other investments with declines in fair value below cost, which the Company judged to be other than temporary, the Company recorded write-downs of approximately $30.9 million, $14.0 million and $12.1 million, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
 
Securities on loan under the Company's securities lending programs are included in its cash and investment portfolio shown on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Under these programs, brokers and dealers who borrow securities are required to deliver substantially the same security to the Company upon completion of the transaction. The balance of securities on loan as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $914.2 million and $197.4 million, respectively. Income earned on security lending transactions for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $1.5 million, $0.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
 
Long-term Investments
 
The Company's long-term investments consisted of the following:
 
 
At December 31, 2003, the Company's debt securities with contractual maturity dates occurring through 2008 had an amortized cost of $112.4 million and a market value of $112.3 million. Long-term investments consist primarily of restricted assets, certain equities and other investments.
 
 
The Company's receivables, net consisted of the following:

Depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $87.0 million, $64.8 million and $45.4 million, respectively.
 
 
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS No. 141") and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS No. 142"). SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method. The provisions of SFAS No. 141 also apply to all business combinations consummated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142, which became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, eliminates amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Rather, these assets are subject to impairment tests at least annually.
 
The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002 and no longer amortizes goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company completed the transitional evaluation of its goodwill and other intangible assets at January 1, 2002 and the annual evaluation at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003 and determined that there was no impairment loss. The following table shows net income and earnings per share adjusted to reflect the adoption of the non-amortization provisions of SFAS No. 142 as of the beginning of the respective periods:
 
 
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment are as follows:
 
 
Upon adoption of SFAS No. 141, the Company reclassified $3.5 million of other intangible assets to goodwill since they did not meet the criteria for recognition apart from goodwill. The reclassification is for the assembled workforce intangible assets acquired from previous acquisitions.
 
On October 31, 2003, WellPoint completed its acquisition of HealthCore, as discussed in Note 3. As a result of the acquisition of HealthCore, the Company recorded $2.9 million of goodwill as of December 31, 2003.
 
On September 24, 2003, WellPoint completed its acquisition of Cobalt, as discussed in Note 3. As a result of the acquisition of Cobalt, the Company recorded $607.8 million of goodwill and $241.3 million of identifiable intangible assets as of December 31, 2003. The valuation process is not yet complete and, therefore, the allocation between goodwill and other intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2003 represents an estimate. The Company assumes no residual value for its amortizable intangible assets. The following table presents details of the acquired amortized and non-amortized intangible assets of Cobalt at cost as of December 31, 2003:
 
 
On June 30, 2003, WellPoint completed its acquisition of Golden West, as discussed in Note 3. As a result of the acquisition of Golden West, the Company recorded $17.2 million of goodwill and $13.0 million of identifiable intangible assets as of December 31, 2003. The valuation process is not yet complete and, therefore, the allocation between goodwill and other intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2003 represents an estimate. The Company assumes no residual value for its amortizable intangible assets. The following table presents details of the acquired amortized and non-amortized intangible assets of Golden West at cost as of December 31, 2003:
 
 
On January 31, 2002, WellPoint completed its acquisition of RightCHOICE, as discussed in Note 3. As a result of the acquisition of RightCHOICE, the Company recorded $1,073.8 million of goodwill and $266.1 million of identifiable intangible assets. The Company assumes no residual value
 
for its amortizable intangible assets. The following table presents details of the acquired amortized and non-amortized intangible assets of RightCHOICE at cost as of December 31, 2003:
 
 
The gross carrying value, accumulated amortization and net carrying value of other intangible assets of the Company as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 were as follows:
 
 
 
For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, amortization expense relating to goodwill and other intangible assets was $41.1 million, $38.0 million and $63.1 million, respectively. The following table presents the Company's estimated annual amortization expense for amortized intangible assets for each of the years ending December 31, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 (amounts in thousands). These estimates were calculated based on the gross carrying value of amortized intangible assets as of December 31, 2003 using the applicable amortization period.
 
 
 
The following table represents a reconciliation of changes in medical claims payable:
 
 
The table above shows the components of changes in medical claims payable for the periods indicated. Medical claims payable includes claims in process as well as provisions for the estimate of incurred but not reported claims and provisions for disputed claims obligations. Such estimates are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider, among other things, contractual requirements, historical utilization trends and payment patterns, benefits changes, medical inflation, product mix, seasonality, membership and other relevant factors. In developing its best estimate of medical claims payable, the Company consistently applies the principles and assumptions listed above from year to year, while also giving due consideration to the potential variability of these factors.
 
Because medical claims payable includes various actuarially developed estimates, the Company's actual health care services expense may be more or less than the Company's previously developed estimates. As shown in the table above, for each of the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the amount shown on the line labeled "Health care services expenses incurred during period: Related to prior years" is negative, meaning that the Company's actual health care services expenses related to prior years were less than the estimates previously made by the Company. These changes in reserves are generally the result of ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends. Adjustments of prior-year estimates may result in additional health care services expenses or, as the Company experienced during each of the last three years, a reduction in health care services expenses in the period an adjustment is made. The impact of any reduction in health care services expenses may be offset as the Company establishes its accrual for current-year health care services expenses.
 
Health care claims are usually described as having a "short tail," which means that they are generally paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other health care provider. Based on the Company's historical claim payment patterns, less than 5% of the medical claims payable as of the end of any given year are outstanding at the end of the following year. Management expects that substantially all of the development of the estimate of medical claims payable as of December 31, 2003 will be known by the end of 2004.
 
The above medical claims payable table includes payables for capitated payment arrangements. The Company has two general types of capitation arrangements. The predominant type is the so-called "professional" capitation arrangement. Under professional capitation arrangements, the Company pays the health care provider, such as a participating medical group, a fixed amount per member per month, and the health care provider assumes the risk of the member's utilization of certain specified health care services. Typically, under professional capitation arrangements, the health care provider does not assume the risk of the member's utilization of any hospital-based services. The second type is the so-called "global" capitation arrangement. Under global capitation arrangements, the Company also pays the health care provider, such as a participating medical group, a fixed amount per member per month. However, under global capitation arrangements, the health care provider generally assumes the risk of the member's utilization of all health care services (subject to certain limited exceptions and state regulatory requirements). As of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company had approximately eight, 10 and 16 global capitation arrangements, respectively, covering approximately 161,000, 179,000 and 185,000 members, respectively. In addition, one of the Company's subsidiaries owns a 51% equity interest in a community health partnership network (the "CHPN") operating in the greater Atlanta area. The CHPN is a locally based equity venture between the Company's subsidiary and a local physician group. The Company's subsidiary has entered into a global capitation arrangement with the CHPN. As of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, approximately 560,000, 535,000 and 479,000 members, respectively, were covered by this arrangement.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company's capitation expenses of $1,626.5 million, $1,496.9 million and $1,198.0 million represented 10.5%, 11.3% and 12.7%, respectively, of the Company's total health care services and other benefits expense. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company's capitation expenses payable of $145.9 million and $137.0 million represented 5.3% and 5.7%, respectively, of the Company's total medical claims payable. Medical claims payable attributable to the acquired Cobalt business as of December 31, 2003 was $168.1 million, including $0.3 million of capitation expenses payable.
 
 
The components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes before extraordinary item are as follows:
 
 
As discussed in Note 2, with the issuance of SFAS No. 145, the Company has determined that the extinguishment of debt under its Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Debentures, which were redeemed as of October 28, 2002, does not meet the requirements of unusual or infrequent and therefore would not be included as an extraordinary item with the rescission of SFAS No. 4. For the year ended December 31, 2002, WellPoint reclassified the extraordinary loss of $6.3 million, which included a tax benefit of $2.5 million, to interest expense.
 
The tax benefit associated with dispositions from the Company's stock plans reduced current income taxes payable for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 by $74.7 million, $65.3 million and $18.8 million, respectively.
 
The overall effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal tax rate as follows (percent of pre-tax income from continuing operations):
 
 
Net deferred tax (liabilities) assets are composed of the following:
 
 
In connection with the acquisition of Cobalt, the Company acquired $156.8 million of deferred tax liabilities and $31.0 million of deferred tax assets. The net result was an increase to goodwill of $125.8 million. The deferred tax assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of Golden West were immaterial to the Company. In connection with the acquisition of RightCHOICE, the Company acquired $108.4 million of deferred tax liabilities and $36.5 million of deferred tax assets. The net result was an increase to goodwill of $71.9 million. In connection with the acquisition of MethodistCare, the Company acquired $15.0 million of net deferred tax assets, resulting in a decrease to goodwill of $15.0 million.
 
As of December 31, 2003, the Company had $5.5 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards acquired from Cerulean, $8.1 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards acquired from Rush Prudential Health Plans ("Rush Prudential") and $23.8 million federal net operating loss carryforwards acquired from MethodistCare. In addition, the Company's $16.6 million of Illinois net operating loss carryforward acquired from Rush Prudential was completely utilized during the year ended December 31, 2001. As a result, management reduced the valuation allowance from $4.3 million to $1.3 million and recorded the change as a reduction to goodwill. These federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2014.
 
As of December 31, 2003, the Company had a state capital loss carryforward of $48.2 million. The Company originally established a valuation allowance of $2.4 million related to this carryforward. However, management increased the valuation allowance to $2.8 million. Management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowance, will be realized. The state capital loss carryforward began to expire in 2003. As of December 31, 2001, the Company utilized its entire federal capital loss carryforward.
 
The Company is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") and various state taxing authorities. During 2001, the IRS completed its examination of the Company's consolidated federal income tax returns for tax years 1992 through 1994. The settlement of this audit did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. The IRS is in the process of auditing the Company's tax years 1995 through 1998. In addition, the IRS is currently auditing Cerulean for the pre-acquisition tax years 1996 through March 15, 2001, RightCHOICE for the pre-acquisition tax years 1999 through 2001 and Cobalt for the pre-acquisition tax years 1998 through 2000. The results of these audits are not currently expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
 
Income taxes paid for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $552.6 million, $394.6 million and $271.3 million, respectively.
 
 
 
 
Pension Benefits
 
The Company covers substantially all employees through three non-contributory defined benefit pension plans. The Restated Employees' Retirement Plan of Blue Cross of California (the "BCC Plan") covers employees of a collective bargaining unit. The WellPoint Health Networks Inc. Pension Accumulation Plan (the "WellPoint Pension Plan"), which was established on January 1, 1987, covers all eligible employees (employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement participate if the terms of the collective bargaining agreement permits) meeting certain age and service requirements. Plan assets are invested primarily in pooled income funds. The Company's policy is to fund its plans according to the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended and applicable income tax regulations. The Company uses the projected unit credit method of cost determination. In October 2003, the Company amended the WellPoint Pension Plan effective January 1, 2004. Beginning January 1, 2004, employees who are of age 50 and over, with combined age and service totaling 65 or higher as of December 31, 2003, will continue to earn future contributions based on compensation under the WellPoint Pension Plan. For other employees, the funds in their pension account earned through December 31, 2003 will continue to accrue interest. However, there will be no additional contributions based on the employee's earnings after December 31, 2003. Once the employee becomes vested (after five years of service) the employee will be eligible to receive a benefit from the WellPoint Pension Plan at retirement or termination based on his or her account balance as of December 31, 2003 plus accrued interest. Employees hired after December 31, 2003 will not be eligible to participate in the WellPoint Pension Plan.
 
In conjunction with the acquisition of Cerulean on March 15, 2001, the Company's Board of Directors approved the merger of Cerulean's Non-Contributory Retirement Program for Certain Employees of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, Inc. into the WellPoint Pension Plan. In conjunction with the acquisition of RightCHOICE, the Company merged RightCHOICE's Non-Contributory Retirement Program for substantially all employees who met the plan requirements as to age and length of service on April 30, 2002 into the WellPoint Pension Plan. Employees of HealthLink, Inc. ("HealthLink"), a RightCHOICE subsidiary, who were not participants in the RightCHOICE Non-Contributory Retirement Program, are now participants in the WellPoint Pension Plan, subject to plan requirements. In conjunction with the acquisition of Cobalt, the Company merged Cobalt's defined benefit plan formerly known as the Cobalt Corporation Pension Plan into the WellPoint Pension Plan, subject to plan requirements. This plan merged into the WellPoint Pension Plan on December 31, 2003. In addition, with the completion of the acquisition of Cobalt, WellPoint became the sponsor of Cobalt's UGS Pension Plan ("UGS Plan") and assumed the assets and liabilities of the UGS Plan. The UGS Plan provides retirement benefits to covered employees based primarily on compensation and years of service. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for its pension plans.
 
The funded status of the plans was as follows:
 
 
Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consisted of:
 
 
Based on the funded status of all of WellPoint's pension plans, during 2004 the Company expects to contribute approximately $17.3 million, $0.8 million and $5.9 million to the WellPoint Pension Plan, BCC Plan and UGS Plan, respectively.
 
As of December 31, 2003, the WellPoint Pension Plan, the BCC Plan and the UGS Plan had accumulated benefits in excess of plan assets. As of December 31, 2002, the WellPoint Pension Accumulation Plan and the BCC Plan had accumulated benefits in excess of plan assets. The Company's pension plans are summarized as follows:
 
 
As of the December 31, 2003 measurement date, the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption was 9.00%. This assumption represents the rate of return on plan assets reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In order to determine the expected long-term rate of return, the Company used market returns for both 10 and 20-year periods for both the stock market as represented by the S&P 500 and the bond market as represented by the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index. Management selected a rate of return within the likely range of expected outcomes.
 
The fair value weighted-average asset allocations of the Company's pension plans as a percentage by asset category were as follows:
 
 
The Company's pension plans have a long-run targeted allocation of 65% equities and 35% fixed-income. The targets for 2004 are expected to remain the same. It is the Company's policy to broadly diversify the investments within these asset classes. The Company executes this philosophy through the
 
use of both active and passive equity strategies. The Company may employ the use of futures contracts to replicate securities, which are otherwise allowable within the Company's investment policy. However, the Company's investment policy prohibits the use of leverage. The fixed-income portfolio is primarily actively managed. Both equity and fixed-income returns are measured against generally recognized indexes.
 
Net periodic pension expense for the Company's defined benefit pension plans included the following components:
 
 
The Company sponsors the WellPoint 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (the "401(k) Plan"). Generally, employees (excluding temporary employees working less than 1,000 hours and leased employees) over 18 years of age are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan if they meet certain length-of-service requirements. Under this plan, employees may contribute a percentage of their pre-tax earnings to the 401(k) Plan. From November 1, 1998 to December 31, 2003, after one year of service, employee contributions up to 6% of eligible compensation were matched by an employer contribution in cash equal to 75% of the employee's contribution. The matching percentage was higher for certain longer-service employees. Effective January 1, 2004, the Company's matching contribution in cash is equal to 100% of the employee's contribution up to 6% of eligible compensation. Matching contributions are immediately vested. Prior to November 17, 2002, generally one third of the employer contribution was in the form of the Company's Common Stock. For payroll periods ending on or after November 17, 2002, a participant's matching contributions are made in cash and credited to that participant's matching contributions account. On and after March 1, 2002, employees may transfer any amount invested in the Company's Common Stock in their 401(k) accounts at any time, consistent with the 401(k) Plan's standard investment procedures. Prior to March 1, 2002, employees were prohibited from transferring the Company's matching contribution received in the form of Common Stock until the calendar year following receipt. The Company's expenses related to the 401(k) Plan totaled $27.6 million, $23.5 million and $20.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company incurred expenses of approximately $38.8 million and $36.7 million related to a new profit sharing program and a stock award program, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company incurred approximately $31.7 million and $26.3 million, respectively, for the stock award program. The stock award program involves an annual grant to all eligible employees of shares of WellPoint Common Stock in recognition of corporate performance. The profit sharing program involves an annual cash-based grant to all eligible employees based upon corporate performance in excess of certain pre-determined thresholds. Both awards are deposited in the eligible employees' respective accounts in the 401(k) Plan.
 
In conjunction with the acquisition of Cerulean on March 15, 2001, the Company's Board of Directors approved the merger of Cerulean's Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, Inc. Savings Program into the Company's 401(k) Plan. In conjunction with the merger of RightCHOICE on January 31, 2002, the Company merged the RightCHOICE and HealthLink 401(k) Plans into the Company's 401(k) Plan. In conjunction with the merger of Cobalt on September 24, 2003, the Company took over administering Cobalt's defined contribution plans, which merged into the Company's 401(k) Plan in January 2004.
 
Postretirement Benefits
 
The Company currently provides certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees and their dependents. Employees outside of California (except as provided in the following sentences) and certain employees in California acquired as a result of the acquisitions and all employees hired, rehired or reinstated after January 1, 1997 are not covered under the Company's postretirement benefit plan. All eligible employees in Georgia acquired as a result of the Cerulean acquisition are currently covered under the Cerulean Defined Dollar Benefit Plan ("DDB Plan"). Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia employees hired, rehired or reinstated after March 15, 2001 are not eligible to be covered under the Cerulean DDB Plan or any WellPoint retiree plan. RightCHOICE provided certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired and terminated employees (excluding HealthLink employees). All eligible employees of RightCHOICE acquired as a result of the merger are currently covered under the RightCHOICE postretirement plans. RightCHOICE employees hired, rehired or reinstated after January 31, 2002 are not eligible to be covered under any RightCHOICE postretirement plan or any WellPoint retiree plan. Cobalt also had postretirement benefit plans to provide medical, dental and vision benefits and life insurance for certain groups of retired employees. Such plans were amended in 1997 to limit the Company's financial contribution in futures periods. No benefits are provided for individuals hired after the effective dates of those amendments. All eligible employees of Cobalt acquired as a result of the acquisition are currently covered under the Cobalt postretirement plans. All other Company employees are eligible for retiree benefits upon attaining 10 years of service and a minimum age of 55. The plan, in effect for those retiring prior to September 1, 1994, provides for Company-paid life insurance for all retirees based on age and a percent of salary. In addition, the majority of retirees age 62 or greater currently receive fully paid health benefit coverage for themselves and their dependents. For employees retiring on or after September 1, 1994, the Company currently subsidizes health benefit coverage based on the retiree's years of service at retirement and date of hire. Life insurance benefits for retirees hired on or after May 1, 1992 are set at $10,000 upon retirement and are reduced to $5,000 at age 70.
 
The Company's accumulated postretirement benefit obligation ("APBO") and the accrued postretirement benefits as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 were as follows:
 
 
The Company currently pays for postretirement benefit obligations as they are incurred. As such, there are no plan assets, except those resulting from the acquisition of Cobalt.
 
The above actuarially determined APBO was calculated using following weighted average assumptions:
 
 
For the year ended December 31, 2002, the medical trend rate assumed a decline from 9.0% for the year 2003 to 4.75% by the year 2008. This medical trend rate was re-evaluated for the year ended December 31, 2003 and modified to 10.0% for the year 2004 with a gradual decline to 4.75% by the year 2008. These estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future. The medical trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For example, an increase in the assumed health care trend rate of one percent in each year would increase the APBO as of December 31, 2003 by $16.5 million and would increase service and interest costs by $1.3 million. Conversely, a decrease in
 
the assumed health care trend rate of one percent in each year would decrease the APBO as of December 31, 2003 by $13.8 million and would decrease service and interest costs by $1.1 million.
 
Net periodic postretirement benefit cost included the following components:
 
 
 
The carrying amount of the Company's long-term indebtedness consisted of the following:

% Notes due 2012
 
On January 16, 2002, the Company issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of 6
3
/8% Notes due January 15, 2012 (the "2012 Notes"). The net proceeds of this offering totaled approximately $348.9 million. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2012 Notes were used to partially finance the RightCHOICE merger discussed in Note 3. The 2012 Notes bear interest at a rate of 6
3
/8% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year commencing July 15, 2002. Interest is computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. At December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, the Company had $349.1 million and $349.0 million, respectively, (based upon the principal amount of $350.0 million less unamortized discount) of 2012 Notes outstanding. The related interest expense and amortization of discount and issue costs for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 totaled $22.9 million and $22.2 million, respectively.
 
The 2012 Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company's option at any time. The redemption price for any 2012 Notes redeemed will be equal to the greater of the following amounts: 1) 100% of the principal amount of the 2012 Notes being redeemed on the redemption date; and 2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the 2012 Notes being redeemed on that redemption date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis at the Treasury rate as determined by the Reference Treasury Dealer (J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. or Deutsche Banc Alex Brown or their respective successors), plus 25 basis points. In each case, the redemption price will also include accrued and unpaid interest on the 2012 Notes to the redemption date.

On June 15, 2001, the Company issued $450.0 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of 6

/8% Notes due June 15, 2006 (the "2006 Notes"). The net proceeds of this offering totaled approximately $449.0 million. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2006 Notes were used for repayment of indebtedness under the Company's revolving credit facilities. The 2006 Notes bear interest at a rate of 6
3
/8% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year commencing December 15, 2001. Interest is computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had $449.5 million and $449.3 million, respectively, (based upon the principal amount of $450.0 million less unamortized discount) of 2006 Notes outstanding. The related interest expense and amortization of discount and issue costs for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $29.7 million, $30.1 million and $16.4 million, respectively.
 
The 2006 Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company's option at any time. The redemption price for any 2006 Notes redeemed will be equal to the greater of the following amounts: 1) 100% of the principal amount of the 2006 Notes being redeemed on the redemption date; and 2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the 2006 Notes being redeemed on that redemption date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury rate as determined by the designated Reference Treasury Dealer (Salomon Smith Barney Inc. or UBS Warburg LLC or their respective successors), plus 25 basis points. In each case, the redemption price will also include accrued and unpaid interest on the 2006 Notes to the redemption date.
 
With the intention of reducing the interest expense associated with the 2006 Notes, the Company, on January 15, 2002, entered into a $200.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement. The swap agreement is a contract to exchange a fixed 6
3
/8% rate for a LIBOR-based floating rate. The swap agreement expires June 15, 2006. As of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, the Company recognized a liability adjustment, for the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement, of $9.9 million and $13.6 million, respectively, related to the 2006 Notes. The Company recognized settlement income of $7.8 million and $6.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, from this interest rate swap, which offset the Company's interest expense for the respective years (see Note 12).
 
The 2012 and 2006 Notes are unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of the Company's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. All existing and future liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries are and will be effectively senior to the 2012 and 2006 Notes. The indenture governing the 2012 and 2006 Notes contains a covenant that limits the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to create liens on any of their property or assets to secure certain indebtedness without also securing the indebtedness under the 2012 and 2006 Notes.
 
Revolving Credit Facility
 
Effective as of March 30, 2001, the Company entered into two unsecured revolving credit facilities allowing aggregate indebtedness of $1.0 billion in principal amount. Upon execution of these facilities
 
(collectively, the "revolving credit facility"), the Company terminated its prior $1.0 billion unsecured revolving facility. Borrowings under these facilities bear interest at rates determined by reference to the bank's base rate or London InterBank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin determined by reference to the then-current rating of the Company's unsecured long-term debt by specified rating agencies. A facility fee based on the facility amount, regardless of utilization, is payable quarterly. The facility fee rate is also determined by the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings by specified rating agencies. One facility, which provides for borrowings not to exceed $750.0 million at any time outstanding, expires on March 30, 2006, although it may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods under certain circumstances. The other facility, which provides for borrowings not to exceed $250.0 million at any time outstanding, expires on March 26, 2004. Any amount outstanding under this facility as of March 26, 2004 may be converted into a one-year term loan at the option of the Company and will bear interest at rates determined by reference to the bank's base rate or LIBOR plus a margin determined by reference to the then-current rating of the Company's unsecured long-term debt by specified rating agencies, plus 0.125% until paid in full. The Company is currently in negotiations to extend the term of the $250.0 million facility to March 25, 2005.
 
Loans under the $250.0 million facility are made on a committed basis. Loans under the $750.0 million facility are made on a committed basis or pursuant to an auction bid process. The $750.0 million facility also contains sublimits for letters of credit and "swingline" loans. Each credit agreement requires the Company to maintain certain financial ratios and contains restrictive covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the granting of certain liens, limitations on acquisitions and investments and limitations on changes in control. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company repaid the entire outstanding principal balance under the revolving credit facility. This repayment was funded in part by the Company's incurrence of indebtedness described below under the heading "Commercial Paper Program." As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
 
Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Debentures
 
On July 2, 1999, the Company issued $299.0 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of zero coupon Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2019 (the "Debentures"). The proceeds totaled approximately $200.8 million. The Debentures accreted interest at a yield to maturity of 2.0% per year compounded semi-annually. Holders had the option to convert the Debentures into the Company's Common Stock at any time prior to maturity at a rate of 13.594 shares per $1,000 principal amount at maturity. In lieu of delivering shares of Common Stock upon conversion of any Debentures, the Company had the option to pay cash for the Debentures in an amount equal to the last reported sales price of its Common Stock on the trading day preceding the conversion date. The Debentures were subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness.
 
On October 6, 1999, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of some or all of the Company's Debentures for cash. The Company did not repurchase any Debentures during the year ended December 31, 2001. During the nine months ended September 30, 2002, Debentureholders converted $18.0 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Company's Debentures with a carrying value (including accreted interest) of $12.6 million. In lieu of delivering shares of Common Stock upon conversion of these Debentures, the Company elected to pay cash of $18.9 million, which resulted in an extraordinary after-tax loss of $3.8 million, which was shown on the Company's 2002 Form 10-K Consolidated Income Statements. On October 2, 2002, the Company announced that it had
 
elected to redeem the Debentures as of October 28, 2002. Substantially all of the Debentures outstanding at that time, which approximated $200.0 million principal amount at maturity, were tendered for conversion into 2.7 million shares of the Company's Common Stock prior to the redemption date of October 28, 2002. The market value of the Common Stock valued upon conversion totaled approximately $229.5 million (based upon the fair market value of the Common Stock at the time of conversion). Approximately $50,000 principal amount at maturity of the Debentures were settled in cash. This conversion did not have an extraordinary income statement impact.
 
As discussed in Note 2, with the issuance SFAS No. 145, the Company has determined that the extinguishment of debt under its Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Debentures, which were redeemed as of October 28, 2002, does not meet the requirements of unusual or infrequent and therefore would not be included as an extraordinary item with the rescission of FASB Statement No. 4. For the year ended December 31, 2002, WellPoint reclassified the extraordinary loss of $6.3 million, which included a tax benefit of $2.5 million, to interest expense.
 
Accreted interest related to the Debentures was $2.5 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
 
Commercial Paper Program
 
In April 2002, the Company commenced a commercial paper program providing for the issuance of up to $1.0 billion in aggregate maturity value of short-term indebtedness (known generally as "commercial paper"). The commercial paper is being issued by the Company without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act") in reliance upon the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(2) of the 1933 Act. The commercial paper is issued in denominations of $100,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof and will bear such interest rates, if interest-bearing, or will be sold at such discount from their face amounts, as agreed upon by the Company and the dealer or dealers acting in connection with the commercial paper program. The commercial paper may be issued with varying maturities up to a maximum of 270 days from the date of issuance. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, outstanding commercial paper totaled approximately $429.8 million and $199.8 million, respectively. The average maturity for the commercial paper was 43 days as of December 31, 2003 and 54 days as of December 31, 2002. The weighted average yield on the outstanding commercial paper as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 was 1.25% and 1.62%, respectively. The Company intends to maintain commercial paper borrowings of at least the amount outstanding at December 31, 2003 for more than one year. Accordingly, for financial reporting purposes, the commercial paper has been classified under non-current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the Company's merger agreement with Anthem, Inc., however, the Company has agreed to repurchase, prior to the closing of the merger with Anthem, any outstanding commercial paper issued by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The related interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $6.1 million and $2.4 million, respectively.
 
Maturities
 
As of December 31, 2003, the Company's long-term debt maturities were as follows: 2004zero; 2005$429.8 million; 2006$450.0 million; 2007zero; 2012$350.0 million.
 
 
 
Debt Covenants
 
The Company's revolving credit facility requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios and contains other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness by subsidiaries and the granting of certain liens, limitations on acquisitions and investments and limitations on changes in control. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company was in compliance with the requirements in these agreements.
 
Interest Rate Swaps
 
As described above and in Note 12, as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company was party to a $200.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement on its 2006 Notes. As of December 31, 2001, the Company was a party to two separate interest rate swap agreements totaling $200.0 million notional amount on its floating rate debt under its revolving credit facility. In September 2002, the Company terminated and settled the interest rate swap agreements on the revolving credit facility.
 
Interest Paid
 
Interest paid on long-term debt for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $50.6 million, $51.4 million and $43.0 million, respectively.
 
 
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 133"). SFAS No. 133, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging ActivitiesDeferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133" and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activitiesan amendment of FASB Statement No. 133" establishes the accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 133, all derivatives must be recognized on the balance sheet at their then fair value. Any deferred gains and losses remaining on the balance sheet under previous hedge-accounting rules must be removed from the balance sheet and all hedging relationships must be designated anew and documented pursuant to the new accounting. The Company adopted SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001.
 
The Company maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to minimize significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations caused by interest rate volatility. The Company's goal is to maintain a balance between fixed and floating interest rates on its long-term debt.
 
By using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates, the Company exposes itself to credit risk and market risk. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in interest rates. The Company manages exposure to market risk associated with interest rate contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken.
 
The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate exposures. The principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with financial and investing
 
activities. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions with which the Company also has other financial relationships. These counterparties expose the Company to credit loss in the event of non-performance. However, the Company does not anticipate non-performance by the other parties. As of December 31, 2003, the Company reported a derivative asset of $9.9 million related to a fair value hedge. The cash flow hedges on the floating rate debt under the revolving credit facility were terminated and settled in September 2002 and are discussed in further detail below.
 
Fair Value Hedges
 
With the intention of reducing the interest expense associated with the 2006 Notes, the Company, on January 15, 2002, entered into a $200.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreement. The swap agreement is a contract to exchange a fixed 6
3
/8% rate for a LIBOR-based floating rate. The swap agreement expires June 15, 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company recognized $7.8 million and $6.5 million, respectively, of income from this swap agreement, which was recorded as a reduction to interest expense. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company recognized a derivative asset of $9.9 million and $13.6 million, respectively, related to this swap agreement.
 
The Company previously invested in certain fixed-maturity securities denominated in foreign currencies. In order to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with such securities, the Company entered into foreign currency derivative instruments. Gains and losses related to such instruments were recognized in the Company's income statement. The Company recognized a gain of $0.5 million from such hedging activities for the year ended December 31, 2001. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had liquidated its non-dollar foreign bond holdings and, as a result, entered into a derivative to offset the remaining currency derivative. During 2002, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $20,000, all within the quarter ended March 31, 2002, related to the remaining derivatives.
 
The transition provisions of SFAS No. 133 state that any gain or loss previously reported in accumulated other comprehensive income on a derivative that hedged an available-for-sale security, together with the gain or loss on the related security, shall be reclassified to earnings as a cumulative effect type adjustment of both net income and accumulated other comprehensive income. On January 1, 2001, the Company recorded a transition adjustment as a charge to other income of approximately $0.3 million, net of tax, which represented a gain of $2.0 million on the available-for-sale bonds related to the Company's foreign exchange contracts partially offset by a loss of $1.7 million on the related hedges.
 
Cash Flow Hedges
 
The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt under its revolving credit facility. The swap agreements were contracts to exchange variable-rate for fixed-rate interest payments without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company recognized net gains of approximately $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, as reported in the Company's Consolidated Income Statements. The net gains recognized represented the total ineffectiveness of all cash flow hedges during such period.
 
In September 2002, the Company terminated and settled its $150.0 million and $50.0 million notional amount interest rate swap agreements with original expiration dates of October 17, 2003 and October 17, 2006, respectively. At termination, the Company paid $17.6 million, of which $1.8 million was accrued interest and the remaining $15.8 million represented the fair value of the swap agreements at the time of termination. The fair value of the swap agreements was reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized as a reduction to investment income on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the original expiration dates of the interest rate swap agreements or the expected cash flows of the commercial paper program. The fair value of the $150.0 million and $50.0 million notional amount swap agreements, at termination, were $8.0 million and $7.8 million, respectively. Amortization of other comprehensive income related to the terminated swaps on a pre-tax basis for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 totaled $8.1 million, or $4.8 million after-tax, and $2.3 million, or $1.4 million after-tax, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the fair value of the $150.0 million notional amount swap agreement in other comprehensive income was fully amortized. The unamortized pre-tax amount in other comprehensive income related to the $50.0 million notional amount swap agreement as of December 31, 2003 totaled $5.4 million. The unamortized pre-tax amounts in other comprehensive income related to the $150.0 million and $50.0 million notional amount swap agreements as of December 31, 2002 totaled $6.2 million and $7.3 million, respectively.
 
In December 2002, the Company decided to hedge a portion of its unrealized gain on an available-for-sale equity investment by entering into a zero-cost equity collar. The Company's intent was to limit any cash flow impact caused by any downside price movement in the stock with its anticipated sale. As a result, the Company designated the equity collar as a cash flow hedge. The collar was created by combining a purchased put option with a written call option. During June 2003, the Company terminated the equity collar and at the settlement date the Company recorded a loss of $0.9 million on investments as the cost to terminate the equity collar.

Effective January 1, 1996, the Company entered into a new lease agreement for a 24-year period for its former corporate headquarters, expiring in December 2019, with two options to extend the term for up to two additional five-year terms. In addition to base rent, beginning in January 1997, the Company pays a contingent amount based upon annual changes in the consumer price index. The Company paid $30.0 million to the owner of the building in connection with this lease agreement, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the new lease.
 
In 1996, a subsidiary of Cobalt completed a sale/leaseback transaction in which an office building in Milwaukee, Wisconsin was sold and immediately leased back. A portion of the gain on the sale is being amortized over the 10-year lease-back period. As of December 31, 2003, the Company has a deferred gain of $1.3 million, which will be fully amortized by the end of 2006.
 
The Company's other lease terms range from one to 19 years with various options to renew. Certain lease agreements provide for escalation of payments that are based on fluctuations in certain published cost-of-living indices. Capital leases consist principally of personal computers, network and server equipment and telecom equipment.
 
Future minimum rental payments under operating leases and capital leases utilized by the Company having initial or remaining noncancellable lease terms in excess of one year at December 31, 2003 are as follows:
 
 
Rental expense for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 for all operating leases was $92.2 million, $76.7 million and $66.3 million, respectively. Contingent rentals included in the above rental expense for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $2.3 million, $1.9 million and $1.5 million, respectively.
 
 
Stock Option Plans
 
In 1996, the Company adopted the Employee Stock Option Plan (the "Employee Option Plan"). The exercise price of options granted under the Employee Option Plan is the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of the grant. Each option granted has a maximum term of 10 years. Options granted under the Employee Option Plan vest in accordance with the terms of the applicable grant.
 
In 1996, the Company also implemented the Stock Option/Award Plan (the "Stock Option/Award Plan") for key employees, officers and directors. The exercise price per share is fixed by a committee appointed by the Board of Directors to administer the Stock Option/Award Plan, but for any incentive stock option, the exercise price will not be less than the fair market value on the date of grant. The maximum term for an option is 10 years. Options granted will vest in accordance with the terms of
 
each grant. The Stock Option/Award Plan also allowed the grant or award of restricted stock, performance units and phantom stock.
 
On May 11, 1999, the stockholders of the Company approved the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan (the "1999 Plan") for key employees, officers and directors. This new plan serves as the successor to the Company's Stock Option/Award Plan and Employee Option Plan (collectively, the "Predecessor Plans"). All options granted under the Predecessor Plans and outstanding on the 1999 Plan's effective date were incorporated into the 1999 Plan and treated as outstanding awards under the 1999 Plan. The exercise price is determined by the plan administrator; however, it will generally not be less than the fair market value on the date of grant. The maximum term for an option is 10 years. Options granted will vest in accordance with the terms of each grant. The 1999 Plan also allows the grant or award of restricted stock, performance units and phantom stock. As of December 31, 2003, the maximum number of shares issuable under the 1999 Plan, subject to subsequent adjustments for certain changes in the Company's capital structure, was 13.9 million plus an additional 11.5 million shares incorporated into the 1999 Plan from the Predecessor Plans. The maximum number of shares available for issuance under the 1999 Plan is automatically increased (up to a maximum of 30.0 million shares) by the number of shares of WellPoint Common Stock repurchased by the Company after May 11, 1999 (the "Repurchased Shares") on the open market or in private transactions, so long as the aggregate price paid for the Repurchased Shares does not exceed the cumulative amount received in cash by the Company after May 11, 1999 for the exercise of options or issuance of awards granted under the 1999 Plan.
 
Effective as of February 17, 2000, the Company adopted the 2000 Employee Stock Option Plan (the "2000 Plan") for employees and non-executive officers of the Company. The exercise price and maximum term of any stock option granted under the 2000 Plan are determined by the plan administrator. Options granted will vest in accordance with the terms of each grant. As of December 31, 2003, the maximum number of shares issuable under the 2000 Plan, subject to subsequent adjustments for certain changes in the Company's capital structure, was approximately 9.0 million shares.
 
Under the 1999 Plan and the 2000 Plan, only the net number of shares actually issued is deducted from the number of shares remaining available for issuance under each plan. Accordingly, if option shares are exercised pursuant to a stock-for-stock exercise (including "reloads," which allow an optionee to pay the purchase price of options to be exercised in shares of WellPoint Common Stock already owned by such optionee and to simultaneously receive an award for a number of option shares equal to the number of shares of Common Stock tendered or withheld for payment of the exercised options), only the difference of the number of option shares exercised less the number of shares of Common Stock tendered or withheld in payment of such exercise (or for payment of tax withholding obligations) is deducted from the number of shares remaining available for issuance under each plan.
 
On January 31, 2002, as a result of the acquisistion of RightCHOICE, the Company assumed all of the obligations of RightCHOICE with regard to the outstanding options granted under the RightCHOICE 1994 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan and the Nonemployee Directors Stock Option Plan (collectively, the "RightCHOICE Plans") pursuant to an executed Stock Assumption Agreement. Under the Stock Assumption Agreement, 1.9 million options held by employees or directors to purchase RightCHOICE common stock under the RightCHOICE Plans were exchanged for 1.2 million options to purchase WellPoint Common Stock. The Stock Assumption
 
Agreement did not change the value of the options granted. In accordance with their original grant terms, all RightCHOICE options became fully vested and exercisable upon the close of the merger. All other provisions that govern either the exercise or the termination of the assumed RightCHOICE options remain the same as set forth in the respective grant agreements under the applicable RightCHOICE Plan. The exercise price of each option issued under the RightCHOICE Plans equaled the market price of RightCHOICE's common stock on the date of grant and an option's maximum term is 10 years.
 
On September 24, 2003, as a result of the acquisition of Cobalt, the Company assumed all of the obligations of Cobalt with regard to the outstanding options granted under the Cobalt Equity Incentive Plan ("Cobalt Plan") pursuant to an executed Stock Assumption Agreement. Under the Stock Assumption Agreement, approximately 4.0 million options held by employees or directors to purchase Cobalt common stock under the Cobalt Plan were exchanged for approximately 1.0 million options to purchase WellPoint Common Stock. The Stock Assumption Agreement did not change the value of the options granted. In accordance with their original grant terms, all Cobalt options became fully vested and exercisable upon the close of the merger. All other provisions that govern either the exercise or the termination of the assumed Cobalt options remain the same as set forth in the respective grant agreements under the Cobalt Plan. The exercise price of each option issued under the Cobalt Plan was not less than the market price of Cobalt's common stock on the date of grant and an option's maximum term is 10 years for incentive stock options and 12 years for non-qualified stock options.
 
The following summarizes activity in the Company's stock option plans for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001:
 
 
The options outstanding at December 31, 2003 had exercise prices ranging from $7.82 to $93.49 per share.
 
 
Stock Purchase Plan
 
On May 18, 1996, the Company's stockholders approved the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"). The stockholders approved an amendment and restatement of the ESPP on May 9, 2000. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase WellPoint Common Stock at the lower of 85% of the market price of the stock at the beginning or end of each offering period. Offering periods are six months each and commence on January 1 and July 1 of each year. The aggregate amount of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to the ESPP may not exceed 2,800,000 shares, subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the ESPP. During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, approximately 280,356, 266,040, and 218,000 shares of Common Stock, respectively, were purchased under the ESPP. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the purchase prices were $61.50 and $71.47 per share. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the purchase prices were $49.66 and $60.49 per share. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the purchase prices were $40.05 and $39.74 per share.
 
SFAS No. 123 Disclosure
 
In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," the Company applies APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and related interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. Accordingly, compensation cost for stock options under existing plans is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the Company's Common Stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the Common Stock. No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income related to stock options granted because options under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying Common Stock on the date of grant. In addition, no compensation expense is recorded for purchases under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan in accordance with APB No. 25. Employee stock-based compensation included in reported net income includes restricted stock awards being amortized over the award's vesting period. (See Note 2 for the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share had the Company elected to recognize and measure compensation expense for its stock option grants to its employees based on the fair value method.)
 
The weighted average fair value of options granted in 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $20.21, $18.85 and $14.46 per share, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the following assumptions.
 
 
 
 
Treasury Stock
 
As of December 31, 2003, the Company was authorized to repurchase approximately 35.5 million shares of its Common Stock. As of December 31, 2003, 29.3 million shares of Common Stock had been repurchased pursuant to this authorization.
 
 
The following is an illustration of the dilutive effect of the Company's potential Common Stock on earnings per share. Outstanding stock options for which the exercise price was greater than the average market per share price of Common Stock were as follows: 964,500, 756,500 and 829,900 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Since the effect of these options was antidilutive, they have been excluded from the computation of the diluted earnings per share below.
 
 
 
The following summarizes comprehensive income (loss) reclassification adjustments included in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity:
 
 
 
As a result of the January 31, 2002 acquisition of RightCHOICE, the organizational structure of the Company changed effective February 1, 2002. As a result of this change, the Company established the following two reportable segments: Health Care and Specialty. The Health Care segment, prior to the acquisition of Cobalt, was an aggregation of four operating segments: California, Central, Georgia and Senior/State-Sponsored Programs. With the acquisition of Cobalt on September 24, 2003, the Health Care segment increased to five operating segments with the addition of the Wisconsin region. These Health Care operating segments all have similar characteristics and meet the following five aggregation criteria as defined under paragraph 17 of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" ("SFAS No. 131"):
 
(1) All operating segments provide similar health care products to similar customer types. WellPoint generally markets the same health care products across the country for each of its customer groups.
 
(2) The production processes are substantially similar for all operating segments as they support similar customer groups and products.
 
(3) Each operating segment has the same class of customers, primarily large employer groups and individual and small employer groups.
 
(4) Each operating segment has similar distribution channels that are used for each of the customer types. Large employer group products are distributed primarily through health care consultants and brokers, while individual and small group products are distributed through agents or through captive sales forces. These methods are similar across geographies.
 
(5) The health care industry is highly regulated at both the federal and state levels. All of the geographies must comply with the same federal regulations. While each state's laws are in some respects unique, many states have similar laws and regulations applicable to managed care and insurance companies.
 
The Company's focus on regional concentration allows management to understand and meet customer needs while effectively managing the cost structure. The Company's chief operating decision maker (Chief Executive Officer) reviews the results of operations on a regular basis and holds each Division President accountable for his or her segment's operating results. These operating segments comprising the Health Care segment provide a broad spectrum of network-based health plans, including PPOs, HMOs, POS plans, other hybrid plans and traditional indemnity plans, to large and small employers and individuals as well as other health care-related products, such as vision, preventive care, COBRA and flexible benefits account administration. The Specialty business is maintained as a separate segment providing an array of specialty products, including pharmacy benefits management, dental, life insurance, disability insurance, behavioral health, workers' compensation insurance products and workers' compensation managed care services. Amounts under the heading "Corporate and Other" include net investment income, general and administrative expense and interest expense not allocable to the reportable segments. Also included in Corporate and Other are the operating results from the Company's captive general insurance agency, which has not met the quantitative thresholds for an operating segment under SFAS No. 131. The operating results for the Company's captive general insurance agency were previously reported in the Health Care segment for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, but have been reclassified to Corporate and Other to conform to the 2003 presentation.
 
The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The following tables present segment information for the Health Care and Specialty segments for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, as if the Company's new organization structure had been effective on January 1, 2001. The amounts for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 reflect a new method of cost allocation as reviewed by the chief operating decision maker effective January 1, 2003. As a result of this change, the net income for the Health Care segment decreased by $58.2 million while the Specialty segment increased by $58.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2001, net income for the Health Care segment decreased by $56.3 million while the Specialty segment increased by $56.3 million. In addition, the operating results by segment for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 have been reclassified to conform to a 2003 change in a segment manager's responsibility. For the year ended December 31, 2002, net income decreased by $1.3 million for the Health Care segment while net income for the Corporate and Other segment increased by $1.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2001, net income decreased by $1.0 million for the Health Care segment while net income for the Corporate and Other segment increased by $1.0 million.
 
Intersegment revenues include internal pharmaceutical sales by the Company's mail order pharmacy to the Health Care segment's members, utilization review fees (primarily related to behavioral health services) and claims and rebate processing fees recognized by the Specialty segment for pharmacy benefit management services provided to the Health Care segment. For the year ended December 31, 2003, pharmaceutical sales totaled $410.3 million and utilization review fees and claims and rebate processing fees totaled $85.5 million. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, pharmaceutical sales totaled $288.9 million and $191.8 million, respectively. Utilization review fees and claims and rebate processing fees for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were not separately identified; estimating such fees would be impractical. All intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation under the caption "Corporate and Other."

In December 2000, the Company formed The WellPoint Foundation (the "Foundation"), a non-profit organization exempt from federal taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of the Foundation is to improve the health and well-being of individuals in the communities served by the Company and its subsidiaries. The Foundation's Board of Directors is composed solely of persons who are also officers of the Company. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 the Company contributed or committed to contribute $35.0 million, $45.0 million and $15.0 million, respectively, to the Foundation. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002 the Company did
 
not have any outstanding commitments payable to the Foundation. The Company has no current legal obligations for any future commitments to the Foundation.
 
 
From time to time, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings, many of which involve claims for coverage encountered in the ordinary course of business. The Company, like HMOs and health insurers generally, excludes certain health care services from coverage under its HMO, PPO and other plans. The Company is, in its ordinary course of business, subject to the claims of its enrollees arising out of decisions to restrict treatment or reimbursement for certain services. The loss of even one such claim, if it results in a significant punitive damage award, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, the risk of potential liability under punitive damage theories may increase significantly the difficulty of obtaining reasonable settlements of coverage claims.
 
In May 2000, the California Medical Association filed a lawsuit in U.S. district court in San Francisco against BCC. The lawsuit alleges that BCC violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ("RICO") through various misrepresentations to and inappropriate actions against health care providers. In late 1999, a number of class-action lawsuits were brought against several of the Company's competitors alleging, among other things, various misrepresentations regarding their health plans and breaches of fiduciary obligations to health plan members. In August 2000, the Company was added as a party to , a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of health care providers nationwide. In addition to the RICO claims brought in the California Medical Association lawsuit, this lawsuit also alleges violations of ERISA, federal and state "prompt pay" regulations and certain common law claims. In October 2000, the federal Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order consolidating the California Medical Association lawsuit, the lawsuit and various other pending managed care class-action lawsuits against other companies before District Court Judge Federico Moreno in the Southern District of Florida for purposes of the pretrial proceedings. In March 2001, Judge Moreno dismissed the plaintiffs' claims based on violation of RICO, although the dismissal was made without prejudice to the plaintiffs' ability to subsequently refile their claims. Judge Moreno also dismissed, with prejudice, the plaintiffs' federal prompt pay law claims. On March 26, 2001, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in its lawsuit, alleging, among other things, revised RICO claims and violations of California law. On May 3, 2001, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On May 9, 2001, Judge Moreno issued an order requiring that all discovery in the litigation be completed by December 2001, with the exception of discovery related to expert witnesses, which was to be completed by March 15, 2002. In June 2001, the federal Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit issued a stay of Judge Moreno's discovery order, pending a hearing before the Court of Appeals on the Company's appeal of its motion to compel arbitration (which had earlier been granted in part and denied in part by Judge Moreno). The hearing was held in January 2002 and, in March 2002, the Court of Appeals panel issued an opinion affirming Judge Moreno's earlier action with respect to the motion to compel arbitration. The Company filed a motion requesting a rehearing of the matter before the entire 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which motion was denied by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in June 2002. On July 29, 2002, Judge Moreno issued an order providing that discovery in the case would be allowed to re-commence on September 30, 2002. On September 26, 2002, Judge Moreno issued an additional order certifying a nationwide class of physicians in the matter, setting a trial date in May 2003 and ordering the parties to participate in non-binding

mediation. In October 2002, the defendants, among other things, moved to compel arbitration of most claims (which motion was granted in part in September 2003). In October 2002, the Company also filed a motion with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals seeking to appeal Judge Moreno's class-certification order. The motion was granted. The 11th Circuit heard oral argument on September 11, 2003 on the Company's appeal. A mediator has been appointed by Judge Moreno and the parties are currently conducting court-ordered mediation. In January 2004, Judge Moreno set a new trial date in September 2004 and extended the deadline for discovery to March 31, 2004, which may be further extended.
 
In March 2002, the American Dental Association and three individual dentists filed a lawsuit in U.S. district court in Chicago against the Company and BCC. This lawsuit alleges that WellPoint and BCC engaged in conduct that constituted a breach of contract under ERISA, trade libel and tortious interference with contractual relations and existing and prospective business expectancies. The lawsuit seeks class-action status. The Company filed a motion (which was granted in July 2002) with the federal Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation requesting that the proceedings in this case be consolidated with a similar action brought against other managed care companies that has been consolidated with the lawsuit. The case is currently stayed.

In May 2003, a lawsuit entitled was filed in the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of Florida. The attorneys representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit are primarily the attorneys representing the plaintiffs in the litigation described above. The defendants in are the Company's Blue Cross and Blue Shield-licensed subsidiaries, the BCBSA and all of the other current Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensees. The lawsuit alleges that each of the defendants engaged in similar activities and conduct as that alleged in the litigation. The case has been assigned to Judge Moreno. The defendants have moved to compel arbitration and to dismiss the complaint.

In July 2001, two individual physicians seeking to represent a class of physicians, hospitals and other providers brought suit in the Circuit Court of Madison County, Illinois against HealthLink, Inc., which is now a subsidiary of the Company as a result of the acquisition of RightCHOICE. The physicians allege that HealthLink breached the contracts with these physicians by engaging in the practices of "bundling" and "down-coding" in its processing and payment of provider claims. The relief sought includes an injunction against these practices and damages in an unspecified amount. This litigation was dismissed without prejudice at the request of the plaintiffs in February 2003. A similar lawsuit was brought by physicians (including one of the physicians in the case described above) in the same court in Madison County, Illinois, on behalf of a nationwide class of providers who contract with Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans against the BCBSA and another Blue Cross Blue Shield plan. The complaint recites that it is brought against those entities and their "unnamed subsidiaries, licensees, and affiliates," listing a large number of Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, including "Alliance Blue Cross Blue Shield of Missouri." The plaintiffs also allege that the plans have systematically engaged in practices known as "short paying," "bundling" and "down-coding" in their processing and payment of subscriber claims. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Missouri has not been formally named or served as a defendant in this lawsuit. The BCBSA was dismissed as a defendant in this lawsuit in August 2002. In early 2004, a class of providers in Illinois was certified. The certified class does not include any Illinois providers that contract with the Company.
 
On March 26, 2003, a lawsuit entitled was filed in the California Superior Court in Alameda County, California. WellPoint and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries are named as defendants in the lawsuit. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated California Business and Professions Code Section 17200 by engaging in unfair, fraudulent and unlawful business practices. The complaint alleges, among other things, that pharmacy benefit management companies (such as the Company's subsidiary that does business under the tradename WellPoint Pharmacy Management) engage in unfair practices such as negotiating discounts in prices of drugs from pharmacies and negotiating rebates from drug manufacturers and retaining such discounts and rebates for their own benefit. The complaint also alleges that drugs are included in formularies in exchange for rebates and that the defendants charge patient co-payments that exceed the actual cost of generic drugs.

In early 2003, a lawsuit entitled was filed in U.S. District Court in Oregon. This litigation has subsequently been transferred to Judge Moreno of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. This litigation is a putative class action lawsuit on behalf of chiropractors in the western United States. The Company is a named defendant in the lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges that each of the defendants engaged in similar activities and conduct as that alleged in the litigation.

In October 2003, a lawsuit entitled was filed in the U.S. District Court in the Southern District in Florida. The Company is a named defendant in this lawsuit, although the Company has not yet been served. This lawsuit is also a putative class action brought on behalf of chiropractors, podiatrists and certain other types of health care practitioners nationwide. This lawsuit also alleges that the defendants engaged in similar activities and conduct as that alleged in the litigation. On December 15, 2003, this lawsuit was transferred to Judge Moreno, and the case was consolidated with the lawsuit for pre-trial purposes. Both of these cases are currently stayed. In December 2003, the plaintiffs in filed a similar lawsuit against the Company, the Company's Blue Cross and Blue Shield-licensed subsidiaries, the BCBSA and all of the other current Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensees. The lawsuit is entitled and was filed in the U.S. District Court in the Southern District in Florida. On January 7, 2004, this lawsuit was transferred to Judge Moreno. On March 9, 2004, Judge Moreno issued an order restoring this case to the active docket and placing it on a coordinated track with the lawsuit.

The financial and operational impact that these and other evolving theories of recovery will have on the managed care industry generally, or the Company in particular, is at present unknown.
 
Prior to the Company's acquisition of the GBO, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company ("John Hancock") entered into a number of reinsurance arrangements with respect to personal accident insurance and the occupational accident component of workers' compensation insurance, a portion of which was originated through a pool managed by Unicover Managers, Inc. Under these arrangements, John Hancock assumed risks as a reinsurer and transferred certain of such risks to other companies. These arrangements have become the subject of disputes, including a number of legal proceedings to which John Hancock is a party. The Company is currently in arbitration with John Hancock regarding these arrangements. The Company believes that it has a number of defenses to avoid any ultimate liability with respect to these matters and believes that such liabilities were not transferred to the Company as part of the GBO acquisition. However, if the Company were to become
 
subject to such liabilities, the Company could suffer losses that might have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
 
A stockholder class action lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of Ventura County, California on October 28, 2003 against the Company and its board of directors. The lawsuit, which is entitled , alleges that the Company's directors breached their fiduciary duties to stockholders by approving an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Anthem while in possession of non-public information regarding the Company's financial results for the third quarter of 2003. The lawsuit seeks to enjoin the Company from consummating the merger with Anthem, unless the Company adopts and implements a process for obtaining the highest possible price for stockholders, and to rescind any terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger that have already been implemented. The Company believes the lawsuit is without merit and intends to vigorously contest it.
Abrams v. WellPoint Health Networks Inc., et al.
 
Certain of such legal proceedings are or may be covered under insurance policies or indemnification agreements. Based upon information presently available, the Company believes that the final outcome of all such proceedings should not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
 
The Company and its subsidiaries are party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business that contain standard indemnity provisions obligating the Company or such subsidiary to indemnify third parties for certain costs and expenses incurred by such parties in connection with such agreements. These agreements include, for example, vendor contracts, underwriting and loan agreements, consulting agreements and agreements for other services, such as custodial arrangements with respect to certain of the Company's assets. The maximum amount of potential future payments pursuant to these standard indemnity provisions cannot be estimated because the amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred by the indemnified parties is unknown.
 
In connection with the formation of a joint venture providing Medicaid services in Puerto Rico in 2000, the Company agreed under certain circumstances to provide additional funds to the joint-venture entity. The Company agreed that it would make a capital contribution to the joint venture of up to 80% of any amount necessary to increase the entity's capital to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements if (i) applicable law or regulation requires an increase in the entity's capital and the entity does not then have capital sufficient to meet the increased requirement or (ii) the entity's medical care ratio is 100% or greater during any 180-day period and the entity does not then meet statutory capital requirements under the Puerto Rico Insurance Code. The amount of this guarantee will not exceed 80% of the amount necessary to provide the entity with a 12 to 1 premium-to-capital ratio. As of December 31, 2003, the Company's maximum potential liability pursuant to this guarantee was $26.8 million. Since the formation of the joint venture in 2000, the Company has not been required to make any payments under this guarantee and the Company does not currently expect that any such payments will be made.
 
 
Certain of the Company's regulated subsidiaries must comply with certain minimum capital or tangible net equity requirements in each of the states in which they operate. With respect to the Company's statutory regulated subsidiaries, the minimum amount of capital required is based on formulas established by the state insurance departments or other regulatory body. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company and its regulated subsidiaries were in compliance with these requirements.
 
The ability of the Company's licensed insurance company subsidiaries to pay dividends is limited by the Departments of Insurance in their respective states of domicile. Generally, dividends in any 12-month period are limited to the greater of the prior year's statutory net income or 10% of statutory surplus. Larger dividends, classified as extraordinary, require a special request of the applicable Department of Insurance. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements for the Company's insurance company subsidiaries totaled $126.3 million and $29.4 million, respectively. The Cobalt acquired companies accounted for $93.9 million of the minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements balance as of December 31, 2003. The Company's regulated subsidiaries had total surplus of $1,904.6 million and $1,267.0 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The maximum dividend that may be paid by the Company's insurance company subsidiaries in 2004 without prior approval is estimated to be $540.8 million. The Company's insurance company subsidiaries do not include Blue Cross of California, which is regulated by the California Department of Managed Health Care.
 
 
As a result of the acquisitions of Cerulean in 2001 and Cobalt in 2003, the Company currently provides administrative, program integrity and consulting services in connection with publicly funded health care programs. Through Cerulean's subsidiary Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, Inc. ("Georgia Blue") and Cobalt's subsidiary United Government Services, LLC ("UGS"), the Company serves as a fiscal intermediary for Medicare and a provider of claim processing and administrative services in connection with various other government programs.
 
Administrative fees received related to these services were as follows:
 
 
 
As a Medicare fiscal intermediary, the Company is subject to regulations covering allowable cost reimbursements and operating procedures. The laws and regulations governing fiscal intermediaries are complex and can be subject to future government review and interpretation. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations can result in regulatory actions, including fines in excess of fees received, significant penalties and exclusions from being a government contractor for these programs.
 
 
During 2002, the Company recorded two extraordinary items, a gain related to the acquisition of MethodistCare and a loss related to the early redemption of certain of the Debentures. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recognized an extraordinary gain of $8.9 million, or $0.06 per
 
share assuming full dilution, from its acquisition of MethodistCare, reflecting the additional excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over acquisition costs. For the year ended December 31, 2002, Debentureholders converted $18.0 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Company's Debentures with a carrying value (including accreted interest) of $12.6 million. The total purchase price paid by the Company of $18.9 million resulted in an extraordinary after-tax loss of $3.8 million or $0.03 per share assuming full dilution, which was shown on the Company's consolidated income statements included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002. As discussed in Note 2, with the issuance SFAS No. 145, the Company has determined that the extinguishment of debt under its the Debentures, which were redeemed as of October 28, 2002, does not meet the requirements of unusual or infrequent and therefore would not be included as an extraordinary item with the rescission of FASB Statement No. 4. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company reclassified the extraordinary loss of $6.3 million, which included a tax benefit of $2.5 million, to interest expense.
 
 
On October 26, 2003, WellPoint entered into a merger agreement with Anthem, Inc. ("Anthem"). The consideration to be received by the stockholders of WellPoint will be composed of $23.80 in cash and one share of Anthem common stock per share of WellPoint Common Stock. Based on the closing price of Anthem's common stock on October 24, 2003, the transaction was valued at approximately $16.4 billion. Upon completion of this transaction, WellPoint will merge into a wholly owned subsidiary of Anthem and Anthem will change its name to WellPoint, Inc. Anthem, a publicly traded company, is an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and holds the exclusive right to use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in the states of Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Colorado, Nevada, Maine and Virginia, excluding the immediate suburbs of Washington D.C. As of December 31, 2003, Anthem provided health care benefits to more than 11.9 million members, which includes BlueCard "host" members. Headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, Anthem, along with its subsidiaries, offers a diverse portfolio of complementary health and group life insurance, managed care products, pharmacy benefit management and government health program administration.
 
The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among other things, approval of WellPoint's and Anthem's shareholders, various regulatory agencies and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. The Company currently expects the transaction to close by mid-2004.
