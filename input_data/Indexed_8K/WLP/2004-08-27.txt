Section 1Registrant's Business and Operations
 
 
Anthem, Inc. ("Anthem") has entered into a First Supplemental Indenture (the "Supplemental Indenture"), dated as of August 27, 2004, with The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee"), which supplements the Senior Note Indenture between Anthem and the Trustee dated as of December 31, 2002. The Supplemental Indenture provides for the issuance of $200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Anthem's 3.50% notes due 2007 (the "Notes"). Pursuant to the Supplemental Indenture, the Notes will mature and the principal thereof will be due and payable together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon on September 1, 2007. Interest will be paid on the Notes on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning March 1, 2005. The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and will rank equally with Anthem's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding. Reference is made to the Supplemental Indenture filed as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K for the detailed terms thereof.
 
Anthem has had and may continue to have commercial and banking relationships with the Trustee in the ordinary course of business. The Trustee is the trustee under indentures pursuant to which Anthem issued $230 million of debentures as part of Anthem's 6.00% equity security units. The Trustee is also the purchase contract agent for Anthem's 6.00% equity security units. The Trustee is the trustee under indentures pursuant to which Anthem has issued $950 million of notes.
 
On August 25, 2004 Anthem entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Banc of America Securities LLC (the "Underwriter") relating to the public offering of the Notes (the "Underwriting Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, Anthem agreed to issue and sell to the Underwriter, and the Underwriter agreed to purchase from Anthem, the $200,000,000 principal amount of the Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, Anthem has agreed to indemnify the Underwriter against, or contribute to payments that the Underwriter may be required to make in respect of, certain liabilities, including under the Securities Act of 1933. The closing of the sale of the Notes by Anthem to the Underwriter pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement occurred on August 27, 2004. Reference is made to the Underwriting Agreement filed as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K for the detailed terms thereof.
 
The Underwriter and its affiliates have from time to time provided, and may continue to provide in the future, various investment banking, commercial banking and/or financial advisory services to Anthem for which they have received, and will in the future receive, customary fees. An affiliate of the Underwriter is a participant in Anthem's current senior credit facilities and in the bridge loan and the expanded senior credit facilities which will be entered into in connection with Anthem's pending merger with WellPoint Health Networks Inc. In addition, the Underwriter was the owner of the $190,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Anthem's 4.655% subordinated debentures that Anthem received as part of the proceeds from the offering of the Notes. The Underwriter purchased these debentures in connection with the August 11, 2004 remarketing of debentures.
 
Anthem's entry into the Supplemental Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement was in connection with the offering of the Notes which were registered as part of Anthem's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-101969) (the "Registration Statement"), declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 24, 2002. On August 26, 2004, Anthem filed a final prospectus supplement, dated August 25, 2004, which supplements the prospectus in the Registration Statement and which relates to the issuance and sale of the Notes.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
Anthem, Inc., an Indiana corporation (the "Company"), proposes, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein, to issue and sell to Banc of America Securities LLC ("BAS") an aggregate of $200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes specified above (the "Securities"), as described in and on the terms set forth in Schedule I hereto.
 
1. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with BAS that:
 
(a) The Company meets the requirements for use of Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Act") and has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on such Form (File No. 333-101969), which has become effective, for the registration under the Act of, among other things, the Securities. Such registration statement, as amended, including the financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto, in the form in which it was declared effective by the Commission under the Act, including all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement". Any registration statement filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act is called the "Rule 462(b) Registration Statement", and from and after the date and time of filing of the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement the term "Registration Statement" shall include the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement. In addition, the Company has filed, or will file, with the Commission a final prospectus (the "Base Prospectus") and the final prospectus supplement (the "Prospectus Supplement") relating to the offering of the Securities pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act, within the applicable time period set forth therein. The term "Prospectus" means the Base Prospectus together with the Prospectus Supplement, including all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein, specifically relating to the Securities, in the form first used by the Underwriters to confirm sales of the
 
Securities. The term "Preliminary Prospectus" means a prospectus supplement subject to completion specifically relating to the Securities, together with the Base Prospectus. All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, a Preliminary Prospectus, or the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing, shall include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR"). All references in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is "in," "contained," "included" or "stated" in the Registration Statement, the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, a Preliminary Prospectus, or the Prospectus (and all other references of like import) shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is or is deemed to be incorporated by reference therein, as the case may be; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, a Preliminary Prospectus, or the Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include any document subsequently filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), which is or is deemed to be incorporated by reference therein, as the case may be.
 
(b) The Registration Statement has been declared effective by the Commission under the Act. The Company has complied to the Commission's satisfaction with all requests of the Commission for additional or supplemental information. No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement is in effect and no proceedings for such purpose have been instituted or are pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company, are contemplated or threatened by the Commission. Each Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus when filed complied in all material respects with the Act and, if filed by electronic transmission pursuant to EDGAR (except as may be permitted by Regulation S-T under the Act), was identical to the copy thereof delivered to the Underwriters for use in connection with the offer and sale of the Securities. Each of the Registration Statement, any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, at the time it became effective and at all subsequent times, complied and will comply in all material respects with the Act and did not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, as of its date and at all subsequent times, did not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The representations and warranties set forth in the two immediately preceding sentences do not apply to statements in or omissions from the Registration Statement, any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, or any post-effective amendment thereto, or the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements thereto, made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company in writing by BAS expressly for use therein. There are no contracts or other documents required to be described in the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement which have not been, or will not be, described or filed as required;
 
(c) No order preventing or suspending the use of any Prospectus has been issued by the Commission, and each Prospectus, at the time of filing thereof, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"), and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by BAS expressly for use therein;

provided
however
 
(b) BAS will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state
 
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by BAS expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and BAS on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and BAS on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by
 
the Company on the one hand and BAS on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by BAS, in each case, as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or BAS on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
