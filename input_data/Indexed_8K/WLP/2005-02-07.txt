EXHIBIT INDEX
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 February 7, 2005  WellPoint, Inc. (NYSE: WLP) today announced fourth quarter 2004 net income was $184.5 million, or $0.92 per share, which exceeded previous expectations by $0.02 per share. These results included:
Indianapolis, IN
 
 
 
 
Net income in the fourth quarter of 2003 was $208.8 million, or $1.47 per share, including net realized investment gains of $0.04 per share.
 
Net income for full year 2004 was $960.1 million, or $6.10 per share. These results included:
 
 
 
 
 
Net income for full year 2003 was $774.3 million, or $5.45 per share, including a benefit from the resolution of a litigation matter of $0.11 per share and net realized investment gains of $0.07 per share.
 
"Without a doubt, the highlight of 2004 was the consummation of our merger with WellPoint Health Networks, creating a stronger combined company, which now provides health care benefits to an industry-leading 27.7 million individuals," said Larry C. Glasscock, president and chief executive officer of WellPoint, Inc.
 
"Our integration efforts are well underway, and by coordinating best practices and realizing synergies, we fully expect to build upon our outstanding results of recent years and ultimately achieve an even greater sustainable competitive advantage. In 2005, we will lay the foundation for an organization that will become a recognized leader in improving the quality of health care, introducing innovative products, and delivering world-class customer service."
 
On November 30, 2004 Anthem, Inc. acquired WellPoint Health Networks Inc., and Anthem, Inc. changed its name to WellPoint, Inc. Accordingly, fourth quarter and full year 2004 financial results include operations of the former Anthem, Inc. for the respective periods, and also include operations of the former WellPoint Health Networks Inc. for the one month ended December 31, 2004. Fourth quarter and full year 2003 financial results include only operations of the former Anthem, Inc.
 
Furthermore, certain classifications in the accompanying financial statements differ from those previously reported by the former Anthem, Inc. Historical results have been reclassified to conform to current presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net income or shareholders' equity.
 
Unless otherwise indicated, the analysis that follows compares reported results in the respective periods, as reclassified to conform to the current presentation format, and does not adjust any results for the effects of the acquisition.
 
Medical enrollment exceeded 27.7 million members at December 31, 2004, an increase of 15.8 million members since December 31, 2003, primarily due to the merger.
Membership:
 
On a comparable basis, medical enrollment grew by approximately 1.7 million members, or 6.4 percent, during 2004. The primary driver of the growth was membership gains in the National Accounts business unit. Enrollment growth in the Individual and Small Group (ISG), as well as other Large Group businesses complemented the National expansion. Self-funded membership represented approximately 47 percent of total membership at December 31, 2004, versus approximately 45 percent of comparable membership at December 31, 2003.
 
"Comparable" enrollment statistics of WellPoint, Inc. (which include historical data of WellPoint Health Networks Inc. prior to the merger date) are included in the accompanying table entitled, "Membership & Script Volume Summary  Comparable Basis."
 
Operating revenue reached $6.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2004, a 59 percent increase compared with $4.2 billion in the same period of 2003. Increases due to the acquisition were supplemented by strong organic revenue growth, particularly in the ISG, Large Group and National Accounts businesses. The growth in revenues was attributable to both disciplined pricing and solid membership gains. For full year 2004, operating revenue increased by 24 percent, to $20.5 billion, compared with $16.5 billion in 2003.
Operating Revenue:
 
The benefit expense ratio increased by 200 basis points, to 81.5 percent, compared with 79.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase reflected lower than anticipated medical costs in the fourth quarter of 2003 and a return to more sustainable levels in the fourth quarter of 2004. For full year 2004, the benefit expense ratio increased by 120 basis points, to 82.0 percent, compared with 80.8 percent in 2003.
Benefit Expense:
 
Premium and Cost Trends:
Trends include Large Group and ISG insured businesses and have been calculated on a combined entity basis, including the former Anthem, Inc. and the former WellPoint Health Networks Inc. for all applicable periods.
 
Commercial premium yields and medical costs each increased by less than 10 percent, on a rolling twelve month basis, for the year ended December 31, 2004. Outpatient costs were the primary drivers of the overall increase in medical trend.
 
SG&A Expense Ratio:
As previously announced, the selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense ratio for all periods presented does not include the cost of mail-order prescription drugs, which is now shown on a separate line in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
 
The SG&A expense ratio improved by 270 basis points to 17.0 percent, compared with 19.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2003. The improvement was driven by disciplined management of administrative expenses, spreading fixed costs over a larger membership base, and the recently completed merger. For full year 2004, the SG&A expense ratio declined by 180 basis points, to 17.0 percent, compared with 18.8 percent in 2003.
 
Full year 2004 operating cash flow was $1.3 billion, or 1.4 times net income.
Operating Cash Flow:
 
Days in Claims Payable:
This metric has been calculated on a combined entity basis, including liabilities of both the former Anthem, Inc. and the former WellPoint Health Networks Inc. as of December 31, 2004 and September 30, 2004, and benefit expense of both companies for the three months ended December 31, 2004 and September 30, 2004.
 
Days in claims payable decreased 1.4 days, to 48.2 days as of December 31, 2004, compared with 49.6 days as of September 30, 2004. The decrease was primarily attributable to adjudicating claims at a faster pace and the timing of pharmacy claim payments in the PBM business.
 
 
WellPoint, Inc. has three reportable segments:
 
 
 
 
Operating revenue and operating gain are the key measures used by management to evaluate performance in each segment.
 
 
 
 
Operating gain for the Health Care segment increased by 59 percent, to $505.6 million, compared with $318.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. In addition to the impact of the acquisition, operating gain was enhanced by organic growth in the Large Group and National Accounts businesses. Significantly improved SG&A expense ratios were partially offset by higher benefit expense ratios, which returned to more sustainable levels in the fourth quarter of 2004. For full year 2004, operating gain increased by 28 percent, to $1.5 billion, compared with $1.2 billion in 2003.
Health Care:
 
Operating gain reached $46.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, more than double the $21.5 million gain achieved during the same period of 2003. Operating gain increased primarily as a result of the acquisition as well as strong growth in the pharmacy benefit management operation, including a significant increase in mail-order prescription volume. For full year 2004, operating gain increased by 46 percent, to $100.9 million, compared with $69.1 million in 2003.

Comparable basis information:
 
We have included at the end of this press release, for comparative purposes, a schedule that provides comparable basis information for the combined reclassified historical statements of income for the former Anthem, Inc. and the former WellPoint Health Networks Inc. as of and for the periods indicated. This comparable basis information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and is provided because we believe it will enable a more meaningful period-to-period comparison. The comparable basis information is not intended to represent or be indicative of the results of Anthem, Inc. that would have been reported had the merger been completed as of the dates presented, and should not be taken as representative of our future results.
