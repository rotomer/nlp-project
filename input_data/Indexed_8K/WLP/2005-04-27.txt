EXHIBIT INDEX
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 April 27, 2005  WellPoint, Inc. (NYSE: WLP) today announced that first quarter 2005 net income was $611.7 million, or $1.97 per share, which included tax benefits of $0.09 per share due to the favorable resolution of a tax matter relating to the sale of certain subsidiaries in the mid-1990s. Net income in the first quarter of 2004 was $295.6 million, or $2.08 per share, including $0.32 per share in tax benefits associated with a change in Indiana laws governing the state's high-risk health insurance pool, and $0.15 per share in net realized investment gains.
Indianapolis, IN
 
"During our first full quarter as an integrated company, we were able to deliver outstanding results, which is indicative of how smoothly our integration has gone and just how well our combined company is performing," said Larry C. Glasscock, president and chief executive officer of WellPoint, Inc. "Overall, the company accomplished a number of achievements during the first quarter, including adding close to 800,000 new members, further reducing administrative costs and completing its new organizational model."
 
In addition to strong financial results, WellPoint also announced that its Board of Directors has declared a two-for-one split of the Company's common stock to be effected in the form of a 100 percent common stock dividend. All shareholders of record on May 13, 2005, will receive one additional share of WellPoint common stock for each share held on that date. The additional share of common stock will be distributed to shareholders of record in the form of a stock dividend on May 31, 2005, by the Company's transfer agent, EquiServe Trust Company, N.A.
 
"This action, along with our increased guidance for 2005, signals the confidence the Board of Directors has in the future of the company and the success the newly merged company is already realizing," added Glasscock. "The company in a short period of time has laid the foundation for becoming a recognized leader in the health benefits industry that will continue to introduce innovative products, deliver world-class customer service and expand collaborative programs with physicians and hospitals to improve the health of our members."
 
On November 30, 2004, Anthem, Inc. acquired WellPoint Health Networks Inc., and Anthem, Inc. changed its name to WellPoint, Inc. Accordingly, first quarter 2005 financial results include operations of both legacy companies for the entire period. First quarter 2004 reported financial results, however, include only operations of the former Anthem, Inc.
 
Unless otherwise indicated, the analysis in this press release compares reported first quarter 2005 financial results to reported first quarter 2004 financial results, as reclassified to conform to current presentation, and does not adjust results for the effects of the acquisition.
 
In certain areas, we have included "comparable basis" analyses that we believe provide more meaningful comparisons between periods, due to the inclusion of operations for the former WellPoint Health Networks Inc. in the comparable, historical results. The comparable, historical information is not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the results that WellPoint, Inc. would have reported had the acquisition been completed as of the dates presented, and should not be taken as representative or indicative of our future results. The methodologies for calculating the comparable, historical information are either described within the text of the press release, or in the tables at the end of the press release where such comparable, historical information is reconciled to the historical GAAP information of Anthem, Inc. and WellPoint Health Networks Inc. Comparable, historical information and reconciliations for the quarters ended June 30, 2004, and September 30, 2004, are available at under "Investor Info."

Medical enrollment exceeded 28.5 million members at March 31, 2005, an increase of 16.0 million members since March 31, 2004, primarily due to the acquisition.
Membership:
 
On a comparable basis, medical enrollment grew by 1.5 million members, or 5 percent, from 27.0 million members at March 31, 2004. During the first quarter of 2005, the Company sold Unity Health Plans, a 75,000-member managed care plan, to a Wisconsin provider that had a call option. Membership gains were greatest in the National Accounts business unit, with each geographic region increasing by at least 4 percent.
 
Medical enrollment increased by 793,000 members, or 3 percent, from 27.7 million members at December 31, 2004. The addition of 635,000 members to the National Accounts business drove the sequential increase.
 
Fully insured medical membership decreased by 20,000 members from December 31, 2004, primarily due to the sale of Unity, which had 75,000 fully insured lives.
 
Operating revenue was almost $11.0 billion in the first quarter of 2005, increasing by more than 145 percent from $4.5 billion in the same period of 2004, primarily due to the acquisition.
Operating Revenue:
 
Operating revenue increased by $883.1 million on a comparable basis, representing growth of approximately 9 percent over $10.1 billion in the first quarter of 2004. The increase was driven primarily by strong membership gains in the Individual and Small Group (ISG) and Large Group businesses and disciplined pricing.
 
The benefit expense ratio decreased by 70 basis points, to 81.3 percent, from 82.0 percent in the first quarter of 2004, which was consistent with our prior expectations.
Benefit Expense Ratio:
 
On a comparable basis, the benefit expense ratio increased by 70 basis points over 80.6 percent in the prior year period due to the mix of our insured businesses.
 
Premium and Cost Trends:
Trends include Large Group and ISG fully insured businesses and have been calculated on a comparable basis, including the former Anthem, Inc. and the former WellPoint Health Networks Inc. for all applicable periods.
 
Medical cost trend for the rolling 12 month period ended March 31, 2005, was less than 9 percent. Commercial premium yield for the same period slightly exceeded total cost trend, where total cost trend included medical costs and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense, resulting in continued increase in our operating margin. Outpatient and prescription drug costs were the primary drivers of the overall medical cost trend.
 
The SG&A expense ratio decreased by 130 basis points, to 15.8 percent, compared with 17.1 percent in the first quarter of 2004, consistent with our prior expectations.
SG&A Expense Ratio:
 
The first quarter 2004 SG&A expense ratio on a comparable basis was also 17.1 percent. The year-over-year improvement in this ratio reflected continued control of administrative costs across a growing membership base. General and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2005 were $25.0 million lower than in the prior year period, on a comparable basis. During the first quarter, the Company achieved its targeted merger synergies of $25.0 million, net of the costs required to achieve those synergies.
 
Operating cash flow in the first quarter of 2005 reached $710.5 million, or 1.2 times net income. Operating cash flow was reduced by $50 million in merger-related cash payments for the California undertakings.
Operating Cash Flow:
 
Days in Claims Payable:
In order to provide a more meaningful comparison to the current period, days in claims payable as of December 31, 2004, has been calculated including benefit expense of the former WellPoint Health Networks Inc. for the two months ended November 30, 2004. Calculations of days in claims payable, and any related reconciliations, are provided at the end of this press release.
 
Days in claims payable decreased by 0.8 days, to 47.4 days as of March 31, 2005, compared with 48.2 days as of December 31, 2004. The decrease resulted primarily from a further reduction in the length of time between the date of service and claim payment.
 
During the first quarter of 2005, 722,800 shares were repurchased for approximately $88.5 million. As of March 31, 2005, approximately $612.0 million remained available for share repurchase under existing authorization.
Share Repurchase Program:
 
 
WellPoint, Inc. has three reportable segments: Health Care, Specialty and Other. Operating revenue and operating gain are the key measures used by management to evaluate performance in each segment.
 
 
 
 
Operating gain for the Health Care segment was $860.6 million in the first quarter of 2005, an increase of 167 percent from $322.6 million in the prior year period, primarily due to the acquisition.
Health Care:
 
On a comparable basis, operating gain increased by 19 percent from $724.9 million in the prior year period. The improvement was driven by membership growth, disciplined pricing, reduced administrative costs due to leveraging technology investments for productivity gains and realization of synergies associated with the merger.
 
Operating gain reached $91.7 million, an increase of 436 percent from $17.1 million in the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to the acquisition.
Specialty:
 
Operating gain increased by 39 percent on a comparable basis, from $65.9 million in the first quarter of 2004. The improved performance resulted primarily from margin expansion in the pharmacy benefit management operation.
 
Specialty products represented approximately 10 percent of the Company's Health Care and Specialty operating gain combined, compared with 5 percent in the first quarter of 2004, or approximately 8 percent in the first quarter of 2004 on a comparable basis.
