Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
 
On January 10, 2006, WellPoint, Inc. (the "Company") closed its sale of $700,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.00% Notes due 2011 (the "2011 Notes"), $1,100,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.25% Notes due 2016 (the "2016 Notes") and $900,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.85% Notes due 2036 (the "2036 Notes" and, together with the 2011 Notes and the 2016 Notes, the "Notes") pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement and a Terms Agreement, both dated January 5, 2006, and both among the Company and Banc of America Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives of the several Underwriters named in the Terms Agreement. The Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-130736) previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Act.
 
The aggregate net proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the Notes were approximately $2,669,274,600, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering to repay approximately $1.7 billion of borrowings under its bridge facility entered into on December 28, 2005, among the Company, each lender from time to time party thereto, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Merrill Lynch Bank USA as Co-Documentation Agents, Banc of America Securities LLC and Goldman Sachs Credit Partners, L.P., as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Book Managers, and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the "Bridge Facility") and approximately $1.0 billion of borrowings under its commercial paper program incurred to finance the acquisition of WellChoice, Inc. and for general corporate purposes. The Notes are the Company's unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and will rank equally with all of its current and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, including any borrowings under its senior credit facilities, and senior to all of its future subordinated debt. The Indenture, defined below, does not prohibit or limit the incurrence of indebtedness and other liabilities by the Company or its subsidiaries.
 
The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture (the "Indenture"), dated as of January 10, 2006, between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on July 15, 2006. Each interest payment will be made to the persons who are registered holders of the notes on the immediately preceding January 1 and July 1, respectively.
 
The Notes may be declared immediately due and payable by the trustee or the holders of 25% of the principal amount of the Notes of the affected series if an event of default occurs under the Indenture and has not been cured. An event of default generally means that the Company (1) fails to pay the principal or any premium on a Note on its due date, (2) does not pay interest on a Note within 30 days of its due date, (3) remains in breach of any other term of the Indenture for 60 days after its receipt of written notice of such failure or (4) files for bankruptcy or certain other events in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occurs.
The 2011 Notes will mature on January 15, 2011, the 2016 Notes will mature on January 15, 2016 and the 2036 Notes will mature on January 15, 2036. However, the Company, at its option, may redeem the 2011 Notes, the 2016 Notes and the 2036 Notes, in each case, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the treasury rate, as defined in the Indenture, plus 15 basis points in the case of the 2011 Notes, 15 basis points in the case of the 2016 Notes and 20 basis points in the case of the 2036 Notes, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of redemption.
 
The Underwriters and certain of their affiliates have provided from time to time, and may provide in the future, investment and commercial banking and financial advisory services to the Company and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received and may continue to receive customary fees and commissions. One of the Company's joint book-running managers acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with its demutualization and lead managing underwriter of related concurrent offerings, acted as its financial advisor in its acquisition of Trigon Healthcare, Inc. and in connection with its merger with WellPoint Health Networks, Inc. Similarly, each of the four joint book-running managers and/or certain of their affiliates are participants in the Company's Bridge Facility and affiliates of certain of the Underwriters are participants in the Company's revolving credit agreement.
 
The foregoing description of the issuance and sale does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture entered into in connection with the issuance and sale, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
WellPoint, Inc., an Indiana corporation (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell its senior debt securities (the "Debt Securities"), from time to time, in or pursuant to one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of sale.
 
The Debt Securities will be issued in one or more series as senior indebtedness under an indenture, to be dated as of January 10, 2006 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"). Each series of Debt Securities may vary, as applicable, as to title, aggregate principal amount, interest rate or formula and timing of payments thereof, stated maturity date, redemption and/or repayment provisions, sinking fund requirements and any other variable terms established by or pursuant to the Indenture.
 
Whenever the Company determines to make an offering of Debt Securities through Banc of America Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and/or Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (each, a "Representative", and together, the "Representatives"), or through an underwriting syndicate managed by the Representative(s), the Company will enter into an agreement (each, a "Terms Agreement") providing for the sale of such Securities to, and the purchase and offering thereof by, the Representative(s) and such other underwriters, if any, selected by the Company (the "Underwriters", which term shall include the Representative(s), whether acting as sole Underwriter(s) or as a member of an underwriting syndicate, as well as any Underwriter substituted pursuant to Section 10 hereof). The Terms Agreement relating to the offering of Securities shall specify the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be issued (the "Underwritten Securities"), the name of each Underwriter participating in such offering (subject to substitution as provided in Section 10 hereof) and the name of any Underwriter other than the Representative(s) acting as co-manager in connection with such offering, the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities which each such
Underwriter severally agrees to purchase, whether such offering is on a fixed or variable price basis and, if on a fixed price basis, the initial offering price, the price at which the Underwritten Securities are to be purchased by the Underwriters, the form, time, date and place of delivery and payment of the Underwritten Securities and any other material variable terms of the Underwritten Securities. The Terms Agreement, which shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, may take the form of an exchange of any standard form of written telecommunication between the Company and each Representative, acting for itself and, if applicable, as representative of any other Underwriters. Each offering of Underwritten Securities through the Representative(s) as sole Underwriter(s) or through an underwriting syndicate managed by the Representative(s) will be governed by this Agreement, as supplemented by the applicable Terms Agreement.
 
The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-130736), which contains a base prospectus (the "Base Prospectus"), to be used in connection with the public offering and sale of the Debt Securities. Such registration statement, as amended, including the financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto, in the form in which it became effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "1933 Act"), including any required information deemed to be a part thereof at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the 1933 Act, is called the "Registration Statement." The term "Prospectus" shall mean the final prospectus supplement relating to the Underwritten Securities, together with the Base Prospectus, that is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) after the date and time that the Terms Agreement is executed and delivered by the parties thereto. The term "Preliminary Prospectus" shall mean any preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Underwritten Securities, together with the Base Prospectus, that is first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b). Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents that are or are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act prior to the Initial Sale Time (as defined in the applicable Terms Agreement). All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing, shall include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR").
 
All references in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is "contained," "included" or "stated" (or other references of like import) in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is or is deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus, as the case may be, prior to the Initial Sale Time; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus shall be deemed to include the filing of any document under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), which is or is deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus, as the case may be, after the Initial Sale Time.

Filing of Amendments.
 
(c) The Company has furnished or will deliver to the Representative(s) and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein) and signed copies of all consents and certificates of experts, and will also deliver to the Representative(s), without charge, a conformed copy of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto (without exhibits) for each of the Underwriters.

Continued Compliance with Securities Laws.
 
any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters or for the Company, to amend the Registration Statement in order that the Registration Statement will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or to amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus in order that the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as the case may be, will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing at the Initial Sale Time or at the time it is delivered or conveyed to a purchaser, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary, in the opinion of such counsel, at any such time to amend the Registration Statement or amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company will (1) notify the Representative(s) of any such event, development or condition and (2) promptly prepare and file with the Commission, subject to Section 3(b) and 3(m) hereof, such amendment or supplement as may be necessary to correct such statement or omission or to make the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus comply with such requirements, and the Company will furnish to the Underwriters, without charge, such number of copies of such amendment or supplement as the Underwriters may reasonably request.
 
(f) The Company will use its best efforts, in cooperation with the Representative(s) and counsel to the Underwriters, to qualify the Underwritten Securities for offering and sale under the applicable state securities or blue sky laws as the Representative(s) may reasonably designate and in such other jurisdictions as the Company and the Representatives may mutually agree and to maintain such qualifications in effect for so long as required for distribution of the Underwritten Securities; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject. In each jurisdiction in which the Underwritten Securities have been so qualified, the Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of such jurisdiction to continue such qualification in effect for so long as required for the distribution of the Underwritten Securities.

Any such Final Term Sheet is an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus for purposes of this Agreement.
Final Term Sheet.
 
(l) The Company represents that it has not made, and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representative(s), it will not make, any offer relating to the Underwritten Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 of the 1933 Act) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433 of the 1933 Act; provided that the prior written consent of the Representatives hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of any Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses included in Annexes II and III to the applicable Terms Agreement. Any such free writing prospectus consented to or deemed to be consented to by the Representatives is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (i) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and (ii) has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 of the 1933 Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping. The Company consents to the use by any Underwriter of a free writing prospectus that (1) (a) is not an "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433, and (b) contains only (i) information describing the preliminary terms of the Underwritten Securities or their offering or (ii) information that describes the final terms of the Underwritten Securities or their offering and that is included in the Final Term Sheet of the Company contemplated in Section 3(k) or (2) constitutes a "bona fide electronic road show" within the meaning of Rule 433(h)(5) of the 1933 Act Regulations relating to the offering of the Underwritten Securities; provided that each Underwriter severally covenants with the Company not to take any action without the Company's consent which consent shall be confirmed in writing that would result in the Company being required to file with the Commission under Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of such Underwriter that otherwise would not be required to be filed by the Company thereunder, but for the action of the Underwriter.
Permitted Free Writing Prospectuses.
 
(m) If immediately prior to the third anniversary (the "Renewal Deadline") of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, any of the Underwritten Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters, the Company will prior to the Renewal Deadline file, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Underwritten Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representative(s).

(n) If at any time when Underwritten Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters the Company receives from the Commission a notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) or otherwise ceases to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form, the Company will (i) promptly notify the Representative(s), (ii) promptly file a new registration statement or post-effective amendment on the proper form relating to the Underwritten Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representative(s), (iii) use its best efforts to cause such registration statement of post-effective amendment to be declared effective and (iv) promptly notify the Representative(s) of such effectiveness. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Underwritten Securities to continue as contemplated in the registration statement that was the subject of the Rule 401(g)(2) notice or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.
Notice of Inability to Use Automatic Shelf Registration Statement Form.

If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) of Section 6 in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Underwritten Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 6(c), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering
Contribution
 
price of such Underwritten Securities as set forth on such cover. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Underwritten Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 7 to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
pro rata
 
The obligations of the Company under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of any Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the 1933 Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter, and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the 1933 Act.
 
SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Underwritten Securities.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery
 
SECTION 9. .
Termination
 
(a) . This Agreement (excluding the applicable Terms Agreement) may be terminated for any reason at any time by the Company or by the Representative(s) upon the giving of prior written notice of such termination to the other party hereto.
Underwriting Agreement
 
(b) . Prior to the Closing Time, the Representative(s) may terminate the applicable Terms Agreement by notice given to the Company if at any time there shall have occurred any of the following: (i) a change in U.S. or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls as would, in the judgment of the Representatives, be likely to prejudice materially the success of the proposed issue, sale or distribution of the Underwritten Securities, whether in the primary market or in respect of dealings in the secondary market; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the Exchange; (iii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iv) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; or (v) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis, if the effect of any such event specified in this clause (v) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Underwritten Securities being delivered at the Closing Time on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus.
Terms Agreement
 
(c) . If this Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 9, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 4, 6, 7, 8 and 13 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.
Liabilities
 
SECTION 10. . If, at the Closing Time, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Underwritten Securities that it or they have agreed to purchase under the applicable Terms Agreement, and the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, in the proportions that the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite their respective names on the applicable Terms Agreement bears to the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as may be specified by the Representatives with the consent of the non-defaulting Underwriters, to purchase the Underwritten Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If, at the Closing Time, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Underwritten Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Underwritten Securities are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Section 4, Section 6, Section 7, Section 8, Section 9 and Section 13 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
Default by One or More of the Underwriters
 
As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter under this Section 10. Any action taken under this Section 10 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
 
SECTION 11. . All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be mailed, hand delivered or telecopied and confirmed to the parties as follows: notices to the Underwriters shall be directed to the Representative(s) at Banc of America Securities LLC, 40 West 57

or any of its subsidiaries or (y) to such counsel's knowledge, any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or insurance regulatory agency or other governmental or regulatory agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, in each case the effect of which (other than a violation of the Articles of Incorporation or the By-Laws or similar organizational documents of the Company), individually or in the aggregate, would be either to adversely affect the validity or performance of, or consummation of the transactions contemplated by, the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture or to have a Material Adverse Effect;

(15) The information in the Registration Statement under Item 15, insofar as it purports to describe the provisions of the laws and documents referred to therein, are accurate and fair in all material respects.
 
Nothing has come to my attention that would lead me to believe that (i) the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto (except for financial statements and supporting schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom and for the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 (the "Form T-1"), as to which I make no statement), at the time the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto (including the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Commission) became effective or at the Initial Sale Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) the Disclosure Package (except for financial statements and supporting schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which I make no statement), at the Initial Sale Time, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (except for financial statements and supporting schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which I make no statement), as of the date of the Prospectus, as of the date of any such amended or supplemented prospectus or at the Closing Time, included or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely, as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. Such opinion shall not state that it is to be governed or qualified by, or that it is otherwise subject to, any treatise, written policy or other document relating to legal opinions, including, without limitation, the Legal Opinion Accord of the ABA Section of Business Law (1991).
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may state that he expresses no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of Indiana and the federal laws of the United States.
 
Exhibit C
 
 
(1) Assuming the Underwritten Securities have been duly authorized by the Company for issuance and sale pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement, the Underwritten Securities, when issued and authenticated in the manner provided for in the Indenture and delivered against payment of the consideration therefor specified in such Terms Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors or by general equitable principles (whether applied by a court of law or equity). The Underwritten Securities are in the form contemplated by, and each registered holder thereof is entitled to the benefits of, the Indenture.
 
(2) The Underwritten Securities being sold pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement, conform and, when issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of the related Underwritten Securities, will conform, in all material respects to the statements relating thereto contained in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and are in substantially the form filed or incorporated by reference, as the case may be, as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.
 
(3) The Indenture conforms in all material respects to the statements relating thereto contained in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and is in substantially the form filed or incorporated by reference, as the case may be, as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.
 
(4) The information in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under "Description of Securities We May Offer-Debt Securities", "Description of the Notes" and "
", in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 20
under the caption "Legal Proceedings", insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the laws and documents referred to therein, are accurate summaries thereof.
 
(5) Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company and the Trustee, the Indenture constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally or by general equitable principles (whether applied by a court of law or equity).
 
(6) To such counsel's knowledge, no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with any governmental or regulatory authority or agency or body or any court is required for the issue and sale by the Company of the Underwritten Securities or the consummation by the Company of any of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, the Terms Agreement or the Indenture, except such as have been described in the Disclosure Package and
 
the Prospectus or obtained and made by the Company and are in full force and effect under the 1933 Act and such as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws.
 
(7) Neither the issuance and sale of the Securities by the Company nor the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Terms Agreement and the Indenture will result in any violation of the provisions of (A) the Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws or similar organizational documents, as amended, of the Company, (B) any obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any indenture, license, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of the properties of the Company is subject, or (C) any Federal statute or the laws of the State of New York or any rule or regulation known to such counsel of any New York or federal governmental or regulatory agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company's properties, which, in such counsel's experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement, the Terms Agreement and the Indenture, except, in the case of clauses (B) and (C), as would not, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect the validity of the Underwritten Securities, their issuance, or performance or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Terms Agreement and the Indenture or have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(8) The Company is not nor after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Underwritten Securities and the application of the proceeds from the sale of the Underwritten Securities as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, will not be an "investment company", as such term is defined in the 1940 Act.
 
(9) To such counsel's knowledge, other than as described or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; and, to such counsel's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others.
 
(10) The Registration Statement became effective under the 1933 Act upon its filing with the Commission. Any required filing of the Final Term Sheet pursuant to Rule 433 has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 433. Any required filing of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b). No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement (or such Rule 462(b) Registration Statement) has been issued under the 1933 Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been initiated or are pending or, to the best of our knowledge, threatened by the Commission and the Company has not received from the Commission any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the 1933 Act objecting to use of the automatic shelf registration form for the Registration Statement.
 
(11) The Indenture has been duly qualified under the 1939 Act.
 
In the course of the preparation by the Company of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (other than the Incorporated Documents), we have had conferences with certain officers of the Company and with you and your counsel. We did not participate in the preparation of the Incorporated Documents or review all of them prior to their being filed with the Commission under the 1934 Act, but we did review them in connection with our participation in the preparation of the Prospectus. We are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (except to the extent stated in paragraph (4) above), and our judgments as to materiality are, to the extent we deem appropriate, based in part upon the views of appropriate officers and other representatives of the Company. In passing upon the form of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, we necessarily have assumed the accuracy and completeness of the information included or incorporated by reference therein by the Company.
 
Based upon our participation in the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (other than the Incorporated Documents) and our review and discussion of the contents thereof, but without independent check or verification except as otherwise specified above, (i) in our opinion the Registration Statement, as of its effective date, and the Prospectus, as of the date of the Terms Agreement or as of the date hereof (except in each case for the financial statements and schedules and other financial data contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which we express no opinion and other than the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1), appear on their face to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1939 Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; (ii) in our opinion the Incorporated Documents, (except in each case for the financial statements and schedules and other financial data contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which we express no opinion) when they were filed with the Commission appear on their face to have complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; and (iii) nothing has come to our attention which causes us to believe that (A) the Registration Statement, as of its effective date and as of the date of the Terms Agreement, or the Prospectus, as of the date of the Terms Agreement or as of the date hereof (except in each case for the financial statements and schedules and other financial data contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom as to which we express no belief and other than the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1), contained or contains, as the case may be, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted therefrom to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, or (B) the Disclosure Package (except for the financial statements and schedules and other financial data contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom as to which we express no belief and other than the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1), at the Initial Sale Time, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely, as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. Such opinion shall not state that it is to be governed or qualified by, or that it is otherwise subject to, any treatise, written policy or other document relating to legal opinions, including, without limitation, the Legal Opinion Accord of the ABA Section of Business Law (1991).

Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
 
In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.

SECTION 201.
Form and Dating.
 
The Securities of each series and the Trustee's certificate of authentication thereon shall be in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto, the terms of which are incorporated in and made a part of this Indenture, or in such other form as shall be established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution or in one or more indentures supplemental hereto, in each case with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as are required or permitted by this Indenture, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification and such legends or endorsements placed thereon as may be required to comply with the rules of any securities exchange or Depository therefor or as may, consistently herewith, be determined by the officers executing such Securities, as evidenced by their execution thereof. If the form of Securities of any series is established by action taken by or pursuant to a Board Resolution, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Company Order contemplated by Section 202 for the authentication and delivery of such Securities. Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, the Securities shall be issuable only in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples thereof.
 
The Definitive Securities shall be printed, lithographed or engraved on steel engraved borders or may be produced in any other manner, all as determined by the
 
officers executing such Securities, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities. Securities issued in global form shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto (including the Global Security Legend thereon and the "Schedule of Exchanges of Interests in the Global Security" attached thereto).

Each Global Security shall represent such of the outstanding Securities as shall be specified therein and each shall provide that it shall represent the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Securities from time to time endorsed thereon and that the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Securities represented thereby may from time to time be reduced or increased, as appropriate, to reflect exchanges and redemptions. Any endorsement of a Global Security to reflect the amount of any increase or decrease in the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Securities represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee in accordance with instructions given by the Holder thereof as required by Section 203 hereof.
 
SECTION 202. .
Execution and Authentication
 
Two Officers of the Company shall sign the Securities for the Company, by manual or facsimile signature.
 
If an Officer of the Company whose signature is on a Security no longer holds that office at the time such Security is authenticated, such Security shall be valid nevertheless.
 
A Security shall not be valid or obligatory, or entitled to any benefit under this Indenture, unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein manually executed by the Trustee or an Authentication Agent. The manual signature of the Trustee shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been authenticated and delivered in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
 
The Trustee, upon a Company Order, shall authenticate and deliver Securities for original issue in an aggregate principal amount specified in such order. Such Company Order shall specify the principal amount of the Securities to be authenticated and the date on which the original issue of Securities is to be authenticated. The aggregate principal amount of Securities which may be authenticated and delivered under this Indenture is unlimited.
 
If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established by or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Sections 201 and 301, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating,
 
(1) if the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 201, that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
 
(2) if the terms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 301, that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
 
(3) that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
 
If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 301 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 309, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.

Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more Definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same rights, benefits and privileges under this Indenture as Definitive Securities of such series and tenor.
 
SECTION 305. .
Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange
 
The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office or agency and in any other office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.
 
Except as otherwise specified or contemplated by Section 301 with respect to the Securities of any series, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount.
 
Except as otherwise specified or contemplated by Section 301 with respect to the Securities of any series, any Security of such series may be exchanged at the option of the Holder, for one or more new Securities of the same series, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be
 
exchanged at any such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities that the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
 
All Securities delivered upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
 
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company, the Trustee or the Security Registrar) be duly endorsed or shall be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee or the Security Registrar, as the case may be, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
 
Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to Securities of any series, no service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities.
 
SECTION 306. .
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
 
If any mutilated security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
 
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
 
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
 
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
 
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual
 
obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.
 
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
 
SECTION 307. .
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved
 
Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
 
Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:
 
(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be given to each Holder of Securities of such series in the manner set forth in Section 106, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).
 
(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
 
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
 
SECTION 308. .
Persons Deemed Owners
 
Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the absolute owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and premium, if any, and (subject to Sections 305 and 307) interest, if any, on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
SECTION 309. .
Cancellation
 
All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed in accordance with the Trustee's then customary procedures. If requested by the Company, certification of the disposition of all cancelled Securities shall be delivered to the Company.
 
SECTION 310. .

(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Trustee under Section 607;
 
and
 
(2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513.
