Item 5.03Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
Articles of Incorporation
On May 16, 2007, the shareholders of WellPoint, Inc. (the "Company") approved a proposal to amend Article VI of the Company's Articles of Incorporation (the "Articles of Incorporation") to provide for majority voting in uncontested elections of Directors, and the Company effected that amendment. A proposal for that amendment was disclosed in the Company's definitive proxy statement that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 4, 2007. The amendment to the Articles of Incorporation was effected on May 17, 2007 by filing Articles of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation with the Indiana Secretary of State. A restatement of the Articles of Incorporation, which includes the amendment referred to above but no other changes to the Articles of Incorporation, is filed as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
By-Laws
On May 16, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company, acting upon the recommendation of the Governance Committee, approved and adopted (i) an amendment to Section 1.8 of its By-Laws regarding the election of directors and (ii) the deletion of Article X of its By-Laws that contained special governance procedures which expired in November of 2006 pursuant to its terms. The amended Section 1.8 of the By-Laws states that the standard for election of directors is set forth in the Company's Articles of Incorporation and requires an incumbent director who does not receive a majority of the votes cast to immediately tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Governance Committee will then make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept the tendered resignation, or to take other action. The amendments took effect upon adoption by the Board.
The preceding is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Company's By-Laws, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2 and are incorporated herein by reference.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Dated: May 18, 2007
 
 

Exhibit 3.1
The undersigned incorporator, desiring to form a corporation (hereinafter referred to as the "Corporation"), pursuant to the provisions of the Indiana Business Corporation Law (hereinafter referred to as the "Corporation Law"), executes the following Articles of Incorporation:
The name of the Corporation is WellPoint, Inc.
. . The purpose for which the Corporation is formed is to engage in the transaction of any or all lawful business for which corporations may now or hereafter be incorporated under the Corporation Law.
Section 2.1
Purposes of the Corporation
. . The Corporation shall have (a) all powers now or hereafter authorized by or vested in corporations pursuant to the provisions of the Corporation Law, (b) all powers now or hereafter vested in corporations by common law or any other statute or act, and (c) all powers authorized by or vested in the Corporation by the provisions of these Articles of Incorporation or by the provisions of its By-Laws as from time to time in effect.
Section 2.2
Powers of the Corporation
The period during which the Corporation shall continue is perpetual.
The street address of the Corporation's registered office at the time of adoption of these Articles of Incorporation is 120 Monument Circle, Indianapolis, Indiana 46204, and the name of its Resident Agent at such office at the time of adoption of these Articles of Incorporation is Nancy Purcell.
. . The total number of shares which the Corporation has authority to issue shall be one billion (1,000,000,000) shares, consisting of nine hundred million (900,000,000) shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), and one hundred million (100,000,000) shares of preferred stock, without par value (the "Preferred Stock").
Section 5.1
Authorized Classes and Number of Shares
. . The Corporation shall have the power to acquire (by purchase, redemption, or otherwise), hold, own, pledge, sell, transfer, assign, reissue, cancel, or otherwise dispose of the shares of the Corporation in the manner and to the extent now or hereafter permitted by the laws of the State of Indiana (but such power shall not imply an obligation on the part of the owner or holder of any share to sell or otherwise transfer such share to the Corporation), including the power to purchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire the Corporation's own shares, directly or indirectly, and without pro rata treatment of the owners or holders of any class or series of shares, unless, after giving effect thereto, the Corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or the Corporation's total assets would be less than its total liabilities (calculated without regard to any amounts that would be needed, if the Corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the purchase, redemption, or other acquisition, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those of the holders of the shares of the Corporation being purchased, redeemed, or otherwise acquired, unless otherwise expressly provided with respect to a series of Preferred Stock in the provisions of these Articles of Incorporation adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 5.5 hereof describing the terms of such series). Shares of the Corporation purchased, redeemed, or otherwise acquired by it shall constitute authorized but unissued shares, unless prior to any such purchase, redemption, or other acquisition, or within thirty (30) days thereafter, the Board of Directors adopts a resolution providing that such shares constitute authorized and issued but not outstanding shares.
Section 5.2
General Terms of All Shares
The Board of Directors of the Corporation may dispose of, issue, and sell shares in accordance with, and in such amounts as may be permitted by, the laws of the State of Indiana and the provisions of these Articles of Incorporation and for such consideration, at such price or prices, at such time or times and upon such terms and conditions (including the privilege of selectively repurchasing the same) as the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall determine, without the authorization or approval by any shareholders of the Corporation. Shares may be disposed of, issued, and sold to such persons, firms, or corporations as the Board of Directors may determine, without any preemptive right on the part of the owners or holders of other shares of the Corporation of any class or kind to acquire such shares by reason of their ownership of such other shares.
When the Corporation receives the consideration specified in a subscription agreement entered into before incorporation, or for which the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of shares, as the case may be, the shares issued therefor shall be fully paid and nonassessable.
The Corporation shall have the power to declare and pay dividends or other distributions upon the issued and outstanding shares of the Corporation, subject to the limitation
 
that a dividend or other distribution may not be made if, after giving it effect, the Corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or the Corporation's total assets would be less than its total liabilities (calculated without regard to any amounts that would be needed, if the Corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the dividend or other distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those of the holders of shares receiving the dividend or other distribution, unless otherwise expressly provided with respect to a series of Preferred Stock in the provisions of these Articles of Incorporation adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 5.5 hereof describing the terms of such series). Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.4, the Corporation shall have the power to issue shares of one class or series as a share dividend or other distribution in respect of that class or series or one or more other classes or series.
. .
Section 5.3
Voting Rights of Shares
(a) . Except as otherwise provided by the Corporation Law and subject to such shareholder disclosure and recognition procedures (which may include voting prohibition sanctions) as the Corporation may by action of its Board of Directors establish, shares of Common Stock have unlimited voting rights. Shares of Common Stock shall, when validly issued by the Corporation, entitle the record holder thereof to one (1) vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Corporation. Shares of Common Stock shall not have cumulative voting rights.
Common Stock
(b) . Except as required by the Corporation Law or by the provisions of these Articles of Incorporation adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 5.5 hereof describing the terms of the Preferred Stock or a series thereof, the holders of Preferred Stock shall have no voting rights or powers. Shares of Preferred Stock shall, when validly issued by the Corporation, entitle the record holder thereof to vote as and on such matters, but only as and on such matters, as the holders thereof are entitled to vote under the Corporation Law or under the provisions of these Articles of Incorporation adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 5.5 hereof describing the terms of the Preferred Stock or a series thereof (which provisions may provide for special, conditional, limited, or unlimited voting rights, including multiple or fractional votes per share, or for no right to vote, except to the extent required by the Corporation Law) and subject to such shareholder disclosure and recognition procedures (which may include voting prohibition sanctions) as the Corporation may by action of the Board of Directors establish.
Preferred Stock
. .
Section 5.4
Other Terms of Common Stock
(a) Shares of Common Stock shall be equal in every respect insofar as their relationship to the Corporation is concerned, but such equality of rights shall not imply equality of treatment as to redemption or other acquisition of shares by the Corporation.
(b) Subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding Preferred Stock issued under Section 5.5 hereof, the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to share ratably in such dividends or other distributions (other than purchases, redemptions, or other acquisitions of shares by the Corporation), if any, as are declared and paid from time to time at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
 
(c) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, after payment shall have been made to the holders of the Preferred Stock of the full amount to which they shall be entitled under this Article V, the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled, to the exclusion of the holders of the Preferred Stock of any and all series, to share, ratably according to the number of shares of Common Stock held by them, in all remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its shareholders.
. .
Section 5.5
Other Terms of Preferred Stock
(a) Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series, each such series to have such distinctive designation and such preferences, limitations, and relative voting and other rights as shall be set forth in these Articles of Incorporation. Subject to the requirements of the Corporation Law and subject to all other provisions of these Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors of the Corporation may create one or more series of Preferred Stock and may determine the preferences, limitations, and relative voting and other rights of one or more series of Preferred Stock before the issuance of any shares of that series by the adoption of an amendment to these Articles of Incorporation that specifies the terms of the series of Preferred Stock. All shares of a series of Preferred Stock must have preferences, limitations, and relative voting and other rights identical with those of other shares of the same series and, if the description of the series set forth in these Articles of Incorporation so provides, no series of Preferred Stock need have preferences, limitations, or relative voting or other rights identical with those of any other series of Preferred Stock.
Before issuing any shares of a series of Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors shall adopt an amendment to these Articles of Incorporation, which shall be effective without any shareholder approval or other action, that sets forth the preferences, limitations, and relative voting and other rights of the series, and authority is hereby expressly vested in the Board of Directors, by such amendment:
(1) To fix the distinctive designation of such series and the number of shares which shall constitute such series, which number may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) from time to time by action of the Board of Directors;
(2) To fix the voting rights of such series, which may consist of special, conditional, limited, or unlimited voting rights, including multiple or fractional votes per share, or no right to vote (except to the extent required by the Corporation Law);
(3) To fix the dividend or distribution rights of such series and the manner of calculating the amount and time for payment of dividends or distributions, including, but not limited to:
(A) the dividend rate, if any, of such series;
 
(B) any limitations, restrictions, or conditions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, including whether dividends or other distributions shall be noncumulative or cumulative or partially cumulative and, if so, from which date or dates;
(C) the relative rights of priority, if any, of payment of dividends or other distributions on shares of that series in relation to Common Stock and shares of any other series of Preferred Stock; and
(D) the form of dividends or other distributions, which may be payable at the option of the Corporation, the shareholder, or another person (and in such case to prescribe the terms and conditions of exercising such option), or upon the occurrence of a designated event in cash, indebtedness, stock or other securities or other property, or in any combination thereof,
and to make provisions, in the case of dividends or other distributions payable in stock or other securities, for adjustment of the dividend or distribution rate in such events as the Board of Directors shall determine;
(4) To fix the price or prices at which, and the terms and conditions on which, the shares of such series may be redeemed or converted, which may be
(A) at the option of the Corporation, the shareholder, or another person or upon the occurrence of a designated event;
(B) for cash, indebtedness, securities, or other property or any combination thereof; and
(C) in a designated amount or in an amount determined in accordance with a designated formula or by reference to extrinsic data or events;
(5) To fix the amount or amounts payable upon the shares of such series in the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation and the relative rights of priority, if any, of payment upon shares of such series in relation to Common Stock and shares of any other series of Preferred Stock; and to determine whether or not any such preferential rights upon dissolution need be considered in determining whether or not the Corporation may make dividends, repurchases, or other distributions;
(6) To determine whether or not the shares of such series shall be entitled to the benefit of a sinking fund to be applied to the purchase or redemption of such series and, if so entitled, the amount of such fund and the manner of its application;
(7) To determine whether or not the issue of any additional shares of such series or of any other series in addition to such series shall be subject to restrictions in addition to restrictions, if any, on the issue of additional shares imposed in the provisions of these Articles of Incorporation fixing the terms of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock theretofore issued pursuant to this Section 5.5 and, if subject to additional restrictions, the extent of such additional restrictions; and
 
(8) Generally to fix the other preferences or rights, and any qualifications, limitations, or restrictions of such preferences or rights, of such series to the full extent permitted by the Corporation Law; provided, however, that no such preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations, or restrictions shall be in conflict with these Articles of Incorporation or any amendment hereof.
(b) Shares of Preferred Stock of any series that have been redeemed (whether through the operation of a sinking fund or otherwise) or purchased by the Corporation, or which, if convertible, have been converted into shares of the Corporation of any other class or series, may be reissued as a part of such series or of any other series of Preferred Stock, subject to such limitations (if any) as may be fixed by the Board of Directors with respect to such series of Preferred Stock in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 5.5.
. . The number of Directors of the Corporation shall not be less than five (5) nor more than nineteen (19), the exact number to be specified from time to time in the manner set forth in the By-Laws. The Board of Directors at the time of adoption of these Articles of Incorporation is composed of thirteen (13) members. The By-Laws shall provide for staggering the terms of the members of the Board of Directors by dividing the total number of Directors into three (3) groups (with each group containing one-third (a) of the total, as near as may be) whose terms of office expire at different times.
Section 6.1
Number
Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 6.1, any amendment to the By-Laws or any resolution of the Board of Directors that would effect:
(a) any increase in the number of Directors over such number as then in effect,
(b) any reduction in the number of Directors below such number as then in effect, or
(c) any elimination or modification of the groups or terms of office of the Directors as the By-Laws then in effect may provide,
shall also be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire number of Directors of the Corporation who then qualify as Continuing Directors with respect to all Related Persons (as such terms are defined for purposes of Article VIII hereof).
. . Directors need not be shareholders of the Corporation or residents of this or any other state in the United States.
Section 6.2
Qualifications
 
. . Vacancies occurring in the Board of Directors shall be filled in the manner provided in the By-Laws or, if the By-Laws do not provide for the filling of vacancies, in the manner provided by the Corporation Law. The By-Laws may also provide that in certain circumstances specified therein, vacancies occurring in the Board of Directors may be filled by vote of the shareholders at a special meeting called for that purpose or at the next annual meeting of shareholders.
Section 6.3
Vacancies
. . A Director's responsibility to the Corporation shall be limited to discharging his or her duties as a Director, including his or her duties as a member of any committee of the Board of Directors upon which he or she may serve, in good faith, with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances, and in a manner the Director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Corporation, all based on the facts then known to the Director.
Section 6.4
Liability of Directors
In discharging his or her duties, a Director is entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by:
(a) One (1) or more officers or employees of the Corporation whom the Director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;
(b) Legal counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters the Director reasonably believes are within such person's professional or expert competence; or
(c) A committee of the Board of which the Director is not a member if the Director reasonably believes the Committee merits confidence;
but a Director is not acting in good faith if the Director has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted by this Section 6.4 unwarranted.
A Director shall not be liable for any action taken as a Director, or any failure to take any action, unless (a) the Director has breached or failed to perform the duties of the Director's office in compliance with this Section 6.4, and (b) the breach or failure to perform constitutes willful misconduct or recklessness.
. . In determining whether to take or refrain from taking any action with respect to any matter, including making or declining to make any recommendation to shareholders of the Corporation, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion, consider both the short term and long term best interests of the Corporation (including the possibility that these interests may be best served by the continued independence of the Corporation), taking into account, and weighing as the Directors deem appropriate, the social and economic effects thereof on the Corporation's present and future employees, suppliers and customers of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, the communities in which offices or other facilities of the Corporation are located, and any other factors the Directors consider pertinent.
Section 6.5
Factors to be Considered by Board
. . Any or all of the members of the Board of Directors may be removed only at a meeting of the shareholders or Directors called expressly for that purpose. Removal by the shareholders requires an affirmative vote of the holders of
Section 6.6
Removal of Directors
 
outstanding shares representing at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of all the votes then entitled to be cast at an election of Directors. Removal by the Board of Directors requires an affirmative vote of both (a) a majority of the entire number of Directors at the time, and (b) a majority of Directors who then qualify as Continuing Directors (as such term is defined for purposes of Article VIII hereof). No Director may be removed except as provided in this Section 6.6.
. . The holders of one (1) or more series of Preferred Stock may be entitled to elect all or a specified number of Directors, but only to the extent and subject to limitations as may be set forth in the provisions of these Articles of Incorporation adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 5.5 hereof describing the terms of the series of Preferred Stock.
Section 6.7
Election of Directors by Holders of Preferred Stock
. Except as otherwise set forth in this Article VI, each Director shall be elected by a vote of the majority of votes cast with respect to the Director at any shareholders meeting for the election of Directors at which a quorum is present, provided that if as of the record date for such meeting the number of Director nominees to be considered at the meeting exceeds the number of Directors to be elected, each Director shall be elected by a vote of the plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the election of Directors. For purposes of this Section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a Director must exceed the number of shares voted "against" such Director.
Section 6.8
Standard for Election of Directors by Shareholders.
. . Meetings of the shareholders of the Corporation shall be held at such time and at such place, either within or without the State of Indiana, as may be stated in or fixed in accordance with the By-Laws of the Corporation and specified in the respective notices or waivers of notice of any such meetings.
Section 7.1
Meetings of Shareholders
. . Special meetings of the shareholders, for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by the Corporation Law, may be called at any time only by the Board of Directors or the officers authorized to do so by the By-Laws. Shareholders of the Corporation shall not be authorized to call a special meeting of shareholders.
Section 7.2
Special Meetings of Shareholders
. . Unless the Indiana Business Corporation Law provides otherwise, at all meetings of shareholders, twenty-five percent (25%) of the votes entitled to be cast on a matter, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum for action on the matter. Action may be taken at a shareholders' meeting only on matters with respect to which a quorum exists; provided, however, that any meeting of shareholders, including annual and special meetings and any adjournments thereof, may be adjourned to a later date although less than a quorum is present. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for that adjourned meeting.
Section 7.3
Quorum
 
. . Meetings of the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be held at such place, either within or without the State of Indiana, as may be authorized by the By-Laws and specified in the respective notices or waivers of notice of any such meetings or otherwise specified by the Board of Directors. Unless the By-Laws provide otherwise, (a) regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice of the date, time, place, or purpose of the meeting and (b) the notice for a special meeting need not describe the purpose or purposes of the special meeting.
Section 7.4
Meetings of Directors
. . Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or shareholders, or of any committee of such Board, may be taken without a meeting, if the action is taken by all members of the Board or all shareholders entitled to vote on the action, or by all members of such committee, as the case may be. The action must be evidenced by one (1) or more written consents, in one or more counterparts, describing the action taken, signed by each Director, or all the shareholders entitled to vote on the action, or by each member of such committee, as the case may be, and, in the case of action by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof, included in the minutes or filed with the corporate records reflecting the action taken or, in the case of action by the shareholders, delivered to the Corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records. Action taken under this Section 7.5 is effective when the last Director, shareholder, or committee member, as the case may be, signs the consent, unless the consent specifies a different prior or subsequent effective date, in which case the action is effective on or as of the specified date. Executed consents returned to the Corporation by facsimile transmission may be relied upon as, and shall have the same effect as, originals of such consents. A consent signed under this Section 7.5 shall have the same effect as a unanimous vote of all members of the Board, or all shareholders, or all members of the committee, as the case may be, and may be described as such in any document.
Section 7.5
Action Without Meeting
. . The Board of Directors shall have the exclusive power to make, alter, amend, or repeal, or to waive provisions of, the By-Laws of the Corporation by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire number of Directors at the time, except as expressly provided in Section 6.1 hereof and as provided by the Corporation Law. All provisions for the regulation of the business and management of the affairs of the Corporation not stated in these Articles of Incorporation shall be stated in the By-Laws. The Board of Directors may adopt Emergency By-Laws of the Corporation and shall have the exclusive power (except as may otherwise be provided therein) to make, alter, amend, or repeal, or to waive provisions of, the Emergency By-Laws by the affirmative vote of both (a) a majority of the entire number of Directors at the time and (b) a majority of the entire number of Directors who then qualify as Continuing Directors with respect to all Related Persons (as such terms are defined for purposes of Article VIII hereof).
Section 7.6
By-Laws
. .
Section 7.7
Interest of Directors
(a) A conflict of interest transaction is a transaction with the Corporation in which a Director of the Corporation has a direct or indirect interest. A conflict of interest transaction is not voidable by the Corporation solely because of the Director's interest in the transaction if any one (1) of the following is true:
 
(1) The material facts of the transaction and the Director's interest were disclosed or known to the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors or committee authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction.
(2) The material facts of the transaction and the Director's interest were disclosed or known to the shareholders entitled to vote and they authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction.
(3) The transaction was fair to the Corporation.
(b) For purposes of this Section 7.7, a Director of the Corporation has an indirect interest in a transaction if:
(1) Another entity in which the Director has a material financial interest or in which the Director is a general partner is a party to the transaction; or
(2) Another entity of which the Director is a director, officer, or trustee is a party to the transaction and the transaction is, or is required to be, considered by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
(c) For purposes of Section 7.7(a)(1), a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors on the Board of Directors (or on the committee) who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction, but a transaction may not be authorized, approved, or ratified under this section by a single Director. If a majority of the Directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction vote to authorize, approve, or ratify the transaction, a quorum shall be deemed present for the purpose of taking action under this Section 7.7. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a Director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of any action taken under Section 7.7(a)(1), if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved, or ratified as provided in such subsection.
(d) For purposes of Section 7.7(a)(2), a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the affirmative vote of the holders of shares representing a majority of the votes entitled to be cast. Shares owned by or voted under the control of a Director who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction, and shares owned by or voted under the control of an entity described in Section 7.7(b), may be counted in such a vote of shareholders.
. . Shareholders of the Corporation are not personally liable for the acts or debts of the Corporation, nor is private property of shareholders subject to the payment of corporate debts.
Section 7.8
Nonliability of Shareholders
. .
Section 7.9
Indemnification of Officers, Directors, and Other Eligible Persons
(a) The Corporation shall indemnify every Eligible Person against all Liability and Expense that may be incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any Claim to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by the Corporation Law, as the same
 
exists or may hereafter be amended (but in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), or otherwise consistent with the public policy of the State of Indiana. In furtherance of the foregoing, and not by way of limitation, every Eligible Person shall be indemnified by the Corporation against all Liability and reasonable Expense that may be incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any Claim, (1) if such Eligible Person is Wholly Successful with respect to the Claim, or (2) if not Wholly Successful, then if such Eligible Person is determined, as provided in either Section 7.9(g) or 7.9(h), to have acted in good faith, in what he or she reasonably believed to be the best interests of the Corporation or at least not opposed to its best interests and, in addition, with respect to any criminal claim is determined to have had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was lawful or had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any Claim, by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval), or conviction or upon a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that an Eligible Person did not meet the standards of conduct set forth in clause (2) of this subsection (a). The actions of an Eligible Person with respect to an employee benefit plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 shall be deemed to have been taken in what the Eligible Person reasonably believed to be the best interests of the Corporation or at least not opposed to its best interests if the Eligible Person reasonably believed he was acting in conformity with the requirements of such Act or he reasonably believed his actions to be in the interests of the participants in or beneficiaries of the plan.
(b) The term "Claim" as used in this Section 7.9 shall include every pending, threatened, or completed claim, action, suit, or proceeding and all appeals thereof (whether brought by or in the right of this Corporation or any other corporation or otherwise), civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, formal or informal, in which an Eligible Person may become involved, as a party or otherwise:
(1) by reason of his or her being or having been an Eligible Person, or
(2) by reason of any action taken or not taken by him or her in his or her capacity as an Eligible Person, whether or not he or she continued in such capacity at the time such Liability or Expense shall have been incurred.
(c) The term "Eligible Person" as used in this Section 7.9 shall mean every person (and the estate, heirs, and personal representatives of such person) who is or was a Director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, officer, employee, partner, trustee, member, manager, agent, or fiduciary of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other organization or entity, whether for profit or not. An Eligible Person shall also be considered to have been serving an employee benefit plan at the request of the Corporation if his or her duties to the Corporation also imposed duties on, or otherwise involved services by, him or her to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan.
(d) The terms "Liability" and "Expense" as used in this Section 7.9 shall include, but shall not be limited to, counsel fees and disbursements and amounts of judgments, fines, or penalties against (including excise taxes assessed with respect to an employee benefit plan), and amounts paid in settlement by or on behalf of an Eligible Person.
 
(e) The term "Wholly Successful" as used in this Section 7.9 shall mean (1) termination of any Claim, whether on the merits or otherwise, against the Eligible Person in question without any finding of liability or guilt against him or her, (2) approval by a court, with knowledge of the indemnity herein provided, of a settlement of any Claim, or (3) the expiration of a reasonable period of time after the making or threatened making of any Claim without the institution of the same, without any payment or promise made to induce a settlement.
(f) As used in this Section 7.9, the term "Corporation" includes all constituent entities in a consolidation or merger and the new or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, so that any Eligible Person who is or was a Director, officer, employee or agent of such a constituent entity, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent entity as a Director, officer, employee, partner, trustee, member, manager, agent, or fiduciary of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, limited liability company or other organization or entity, whether for profit or not, shall stand in the same position under this Section 7.9 with respect to the new or surviving corporation as he or she would if he or she had served the new or surviving corporation in the same capacity.
(g) Every Eligible Person claiming indemnification hereunder (other than one who has been Wholly Successful with respect to any Claim) shall be entitled to indemnification (1) if special independent legal counsel, which may be regular counsel of the Corporation, or other disinterested person or persons, in either case selected by the Board of Directors, whether or not a disinterested quorum exists (such counsel or person or persons being hereinafter called the "Referee"), shall deliver to the Corporation a written finding that such Eligible Person has met the standards of conduct set forth in Section 7.9(a)(2), and (2) if the Board of Directors, acting upon such written finding, so determines. The Board of Directors shall, if an Eligible Person is found to be entitled to indemnification pursuant to the preceding sentence, also determine the reasonableness of the Eligible Person's Expenses. The Eligible Person claiming indemnification shall, if requested, appear before the Referee, answer questions that the Referee deems relevant and shall be given ample opportunity to present to the Referee evidence upon which the Eligible Person relies for indemnification. The Corporation shall, at the request of the Referee, make available facts, opinions, or other evidence in any way relevant to the Referee's findings that are within the possession or control of the Corporation.
(h) If an Eligible Person claiming indemnification pursuant to Section 7.9(g) is found not to be entitled thereto, or if the Board of Directors fails to select a Referee under Section 7.9(g) within a reasonable amount of time following a written request of an Eligible Person for the selection of a Referee, or if the Referee or the Board of Directors fails to make a determination under Section 7.9(g) within a reasonable amount of time following the selection of a Referee, the Eligible Person may apply for indemnification with respect to a Claim to a court of competent jurisdiction, including a court in which the Claim is pending against the Eligible Person. On receipt of an application, the court, after giving notice to the Corporation and giving the Corporation ample opportunity to present to the court any information or evidence relating to the claim for indemnification that the Corporation deems appropriate, may order indemnification if it determines that the Eligible Person is entitled to indemnification with respect to the Claim because such Eligible Person met the standards of conduct set forth in Section 7.9(a)(2). If the court determines that the Eligible Person is entitled to indemnification, the court shall also determine the reasonableness of the Eligible Person's Expenses.
 
(i) Expenses incurred by an Eligible Person who is a Director or officer of the Corporation in defending any Claim shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Claim promptly as they are incurred upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Eligible Person to repay such amount if he or she is determined not to be entitled to indemnification. Expenses incurred by any other Eligible Person with respect to any Claim may be advanced by the Corporation (by action of the Board of Directors, whether or not a disinterested quorum exists) prior to the final disposition thereof upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Eligible Person to repay such amount if he or she is determined not to be entitled to indemnification.
(j) The rights of indemnification and advancement of Expenses provided in this Section 7.9 shall be in addition to any rights to which any Eligible Person may otherwise be entitled. Irrespective of the provisions of this Section 7.9, the Board of Directors may, at any time and from time to time, (1) approve indemnification of any Eligible Person to the full extent permitted by the provisions of applicable law at the time in effect, whether on account of past or future transactions, and (2) authorize the Corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any Eligible Person against any Liability or Expense asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such Liability or Expense.
(k) The provisions of this Section 7.9 shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each Eligible Person, and an Eligible Person's rights hereunder shall not be diminished or otherwise adversely affected by any repeal, amendment, or modification of this Section 7.9 that occurs subsequent to such person becoming an Eligible Person.
(l) The provisions of this Section 7.9 shall be applicable to Claims made or commenced after the adoption hereof, whether arising from acts or omissions to act occurring before or after the adoption hereof.
(m) If this Section 7.9 or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Director or officer and may indemnify each employee or agent of the Corporation as to costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Section 7.9 that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
. . Except as provided in Sections 8.2 and 8.3 hereof, neither the Corporation nor its Subsidiaries, if any, shall become a party to any Business Combination with a Related Person without the prior affirmative vote at a meeting of the Corporation's shareholders:
Section 8.1
Supermajority Vote
(a) Of not less than sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of all the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the outstanding shares of all classes of Voting Stock of the Corporation considered for purposes of this Article VIII as a single class, and
 
(b) Of an Independent Majority of Shareholders.
Such favorable votes shall be in addition to any shareholder vote which would be required without reference to this Section 8.1 and shall be required notwithstanding the fact that no vote may be required, or that some lesser percentage may be specified by law or elsewhere in these Articles of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Corporation or otherwise.
. . The provisions of Section 8.1 of this Article VIII shall not apply to a Business Combination if all of the conditions set forth in subsections (a) through (d) are satisfied.
Section 8.2
Fair Price Exception
(a) The fair market value of the property, securities, or other consideration to be received per share by holders of each class or series of capital stock of the Corporation in the Business Combination is not less, as of the date of the consummation of the Business Combination (the "Consummation Date"), than the higher of the following: (1) the highest per share price (with appropriate adjustments for recapitalizations and for stock splits, stock dividends, and like distributions), including brokerage commissions and solicitation fees paid by the Related Person in acquiring any of its holdings, of such class or series of capital stock within the two-year period immediately prior to the first public announcement of the proposed Business Combination ("Announcement Date") plus interest compounded annually from the date that the Related Person became a Related Person (the "Determination Date"), or if later from a date two years before the Consummation Date, through the Consummation Date, at the rate publicly announced as the "prime rate" of interest of Citibank, N.A. (or of such other major bank headquartered in New York as may be selected by a majority of the Continuing Directors) from time to time in effect, less the aggregate amount of any cash dividends paid and the fair market value of any dividends paid in other than cash on each share of such stock from the date from which interest accrues under the preceding clause through the Consummation Date up to but not exceeding the amount of interest so payable per share; (2) the fair market value per share of such class or series on the Announcement Date as determined by the highest closing sale price during the 30-day period immediately preceding the Announcement Date if such stock is listed on a securities exchange registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or, if such stock is not listed on any such exchange, the highest closing bid quotation with respect to such stock during the 30-day period preceding the Announcement Date on the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation System or any similar system then in use, or if no such quotations are available, the fair market value of such stock immediately prior to the first public announcement of the proposed Business Combination as determined by the Continuing Directors in good faith. In the event of a Business Combination upon the consummation of which the Corporation would be the surviving corporation or company or would continue to exist (unless it is provided, contemplated, or intended that as part of such Business Combination or within one year after consummation thereof a plan of liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation will be effected), the term "other consideration to be received" shall include
OR
 
(without limitation) Common Stock and/or the shares of any other class of stock retained by shareholders of the Corporation other than Related Persons who are parties to such Business Combination;
(b) The consideration to be received in such Business Combination by holders of each class or series of capital stock of the Corporation other than the Related Person involved shall, except to the extent that a shareholder agrees otherwise as to all or part of the shares which he or she owns, be in the same form and of the same kind as the consideration paid by the Related Person in acquiring the majority of the shares of capital stock of such class or series already Beneficially Owned by it;
(c) After such Related Person became a Related Person and prior to the consummation of such Business Combination: (1) such Related Person shall have taken steps to ensure that the Board of Directors of the Corporation included at all times representation by Continuing Directors proportionate to the ratio that the number of shares of Voting Stock of the Corporation from time to time owned by shareholders who are not Related Persons bears to all shares of Voting Stock of the Corporation outstanding at the time in question (with a Continuing Director to occupy any resulting fractional position among the Directors); (2) such Related Person shall not have acquired from the Corporation, directly or indirectly, any shares of the Corporation (except upon conversion of convertible securities acquired by it prior to becoming a Related Person or as a result of a pro rata stock dividend, stock split, or division of shares or in a transaction which satisfied all applicable requirements of this Article VIII); (3) such Related Person shall not have acquired any additional shares of Voting Stock of the Corporation or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Voting Stock except as a part of the transaction which resulted in such Related Person's becoming a Related Person; and (4) such Related Person shall not have received the benefit, directly or indirectly (except proportionately as a shareholder), of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges, or other financial assistance or tax credits provided by the Corporation or any Subsidiary, or made any major change in the Corporation's business or equity capital structure or entered into any contract, arrangement, or understanding with the Corporation except any such change, contract, arrangement, or understanding as may have been approved by the favorable vote of not less than a majority of the Continuing Directors of the Corporation; and
(d) A proxy or information statement complying with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder, as then in force for corporations subject to the requirements of Section 14 of such Act (even if the Corporation is not otherwise subject to Section 14 of such Act), shall have been mailed to all holders of shares of the Corporation's capital stock entitled to vote with respect to such Business Combination. Such proxy or information statement shall contain on the face page thereof, in a prominent place, any recommendations as to the advisability (or inadvisability) of the Business Combination which the Continuing Directors, or any of them, may have furnished in writing and, if deemed advisable by a majority of the Continuing Directors, a fair summary of an opinion of a reputable investment banking firm addressed to the Corporation as to the fairness (or lack of fairness) of the terms of such Business Combination from the point of view of the holders of shares of Voting Stock other than any Related Person (such investment banking firm to be selected by a majority of the Continuing Directors, to be furnished with all information it reasonably requests, and to be paid a reasonable fee for its services upon receipt by the Corporation of such opinion).
 
. . The provisions of Section 8.1 hereof shall not apply to a Business Combination if:
Section 8.3
Director Approval Exception
(a) The Directors, by a favorable vote of not less than two-thirds (b) of the Directors who then qualify as Continuing Directors, (1) have expressly approved a memorandum of understanding with the Related Person with respect to the Business Combination prior to the time that the Related Person became a Related Person and the Business Combination is effected on substantially the same terms and conditions as are provided by the memorandum of understanding, or (2) have otherwise approved the Business Combination; or
(b) The Business Combination is solely between the Corporation and another corporation, one hundred percent (100%) of the Voting Stock of which is owned directly or indirectly by the Corporation.

(4) Any reclassification of securities, recapitalization, or other transaction (other than a redemption in accordance with the terms of the security redeemed) which has the effect, directly or indirectly, of increasing the proportionate amount of shares of Voting Stock of the Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof which are Beneficially Owned by a Related Person, or any partial or complete liquidation, spinoff, splitoff, or splitup of the Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof; provided, however, that this Section 8.4(a)(4) shall not relate to any transaction that has been approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors; or

. . Any amendment, change, or repeal of this Article VIII or of Sections 6.6, 7.2, 7.6, 12.2, or 12.3, or any other amendment of these Articles of Incorporation which would have the effect of modifying or permitting circumvention of this Article VIII or such other provisions of these Articles of Incorporation, shall require the affirmative vote, at a meeting of shareholders of the Corporation:

. . Nothing in this Article VIII shall be construed to relieve any Related Person from any fiduciary duty imposed by law.
Section 8.7
Fiduciary Obligations Unaffected
 
. . The provisions of this Article VIII are nonexclusive and are in addition to any other provisions of law or these Articles of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Corporation relating to Business Combinations, Related Persons, or similar matters.
Section 8.8
Article VIII Nonexclusive
. . Except with the prior approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors (as defined in Section 9.14 below), no Person (as defined in Section 9.14 below) shall Beneficially Own (as defined in Section 9.14 below) shares of Capital Stock (as defined in Section 9.14 below) in excess of the Ownership Limit (as defined in Section 9.14 below). Any Transfer (as defined in Section 9.14 below) that, if effective, would result in any Person Beneficially Owning Capital Stock in excess of the Ownership Limit shall result in such intended transferee acquiring no rights in such shares of Capital Stock (other than those rights expressly granted in this Article IX) and such number of shares of Capital Stock shall be deemed transferred to the Share Escrow Agent (as defined in Section 9.14 below) as set forth in this Article IX.
Section 9.1
Limitation on Ownership
. . If, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article IX, there is a purported Transfer or other change in the capital structure of the Corporation such that any Person would Beneficially Own shares of Capital Stock in excess of the Ownership Limit (a "Purported Owner"), then, upon such Transfer or change in capital structure, such shares of Capital Stock in excess of the Ownership Limit shall be Excess Shares for purposes of this Article IX; provided, however, that in the event that any Person becomes a Purported Owner as a result of Beneficial Ownership of Capital Stock of one Person being aggregated with another Person, then the number of Excess Shares subject to this Article IX shall be allocated pro rata among each Purported Owner in proportion to each Person's total Beneficial Ownership (without regard to any aggregation with another Person pursuant to Section 9.14(b)(4) or (5). Upon the occurrence of any event that would cause any Person to exceed the Ownership Limit (including without limitation the expiration of a voting trust, without being renewed on substantially similar terms, that entitled such Person to an exemption from the Ownership Limit), all shares of Capital Stock Beneficially Owned by such Person in excess of the Ownership Limit shall also be Excess Shares for purposes of this Article IX, such Person shall be deemed the Purported Owner of such Excess Shares and such Person's rights in such Excess Shares shall be as prescribed in this Article IX. Excess Shares shall not constitute a separate class of Capital Stock.
Section 9.2
Excess Shares
. . If the Corporation at any time determines that a Transfer has taken place in violation of Section 9.1 or that a Purported Owner intends to acquire or has attempted to acquire Beneficial Ownership of any shares of Capital Stock in violation of Section 9.1, the Corporation shall take such action as it deems advisable to refuse to give effect to or to prevent such Transfer, including, without limitation, refusing to give effect to such Transfer on the books of the Corporation or instituting proceedings to enjoin or rescind such Transfer; provided, however, that any purported Transfers in violation of Section 9.1 shall automatically result in all shares of Capital Stock in excess of the Ownership Limit being deemed Excess Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Article IX shall limit the authority of the Corporation to take such other action as it deems necessary or advisable to protect the Corporation and the interests of its stockholders.
Section 9.3
Authority of the Corporation
 
. . Any Purported Owner who acquires or attempts to acquire shares of Capital Stock in violation of Section 9.l, or any Purported Owner who is a transferee such that any shares of Capital Stock are deemed Excess Shares under Section 9.2, shall immediately give written notice to the Corporation of such event and shall provide to the Corporation such other information as the Corporation may request.
Section 9.4
Written Notice Required
. . Each certificate for Capital Stock issued by the Corporation shall bear an appropriate legend with regard to the restrictions on ownership and transfer of stock set forth in these Articles of Incorporation.
Section 9.5
Restrictive Legend
. . Upon the occurrence of a Transfer or an event that results in Excess Shares pursuant to Section 9.2, such Excess Shares shall automatically be transferred immediately to the Share Escrow Agent, which Excess Shares, subject to the provisions of this Article IX, shall be held by the Share Escrow Agent until such time as the Excess Shares are transferred to a Person whose acquisition thereof will not violate the Ownership Limit (a "Permitted Transferee") and the Share Escrow Agent shall be authorized to execute any and all documents sufficient to transfer title to any Permitted Transferee, even in the absence of receipt of certificate(s) representing Excess Shares. The Corporation shall take such actions as it deems necessary to give effect to such transfer to the Share Escrow Agent, including by issuing a stop transfer order to the Corporation's transfer agent with respect to any attempted transfer by the Purported Owner or its nominee of any Excess Shares and by giving effect, or by instructing the Corporation's transfer agent to give effect, to such transfer to a Permitted Transferee on the books of the Corporation. Excess Shares so held shall be issued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock. The Purported Owner shall have no rights in such Excess Shares except as provided in Sections 9.7, 9.8, and 9.11 and the administration of the Excess Shares escrow shall be governed by the terms of a Share Escrow Agent Agreement.
Section 9.6
Share Escrow Agent
. . The Share Escrow Agent, as record holder of Excess Shares, shall be entitled to receive all dividends and distributions as may be declared by the Board of Directors with respect to Excess Shares (the "Excess Share Dividends") and shall hold the Excess Share Dividends until disbursed in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.11 following. The Purported Owner, with respect to Excess Shares purported to be Beneficially Owned by such Purported Owner prior to such time that the Corporation determines that such shares are Excess Shares, shall repay to the Share Escrow Agent the amount of any Excess Share Dividends received by it that (i) are attributable to any Excess Shares and (ii) the record date of which is on or after the date that such shares become Excess Shares. The Corporation shall take all measures that it determines reasonably necessary to recover the amount of any Excess Share Dividends paid to a Purported Owner, including, if necessary, withholding any portion of future dividends or distributions payable on shares of Capital Stock Beneficially Owned by any Purported Owner (including on shares which fall below the Ownership Limit as well as on Excess Shares), and, as soon as practicable following the Corporation's receipt or withholding thereof, shall pay over to the Share Escrow Agent the dividends so received or withheld, as the case may be.
Section 9.7
Dividends on Excess Shares
. . In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of, or any distribution of the
Section 9.8
Effect of Liquidation etc. on Excess Shares
 
assets of, the Corporation, the Share Escrow Agent shall be entitled to receive, ratably with each other holder of Capital Stock of the same class or series, that portion of the assets of the Corporation that is available for distribution to the holders of such class or series of Capital Stock. The Share Escrow Agent shall distribute to the Purported Owner the amounts received upon such liquidations, dissolution or winding up or distribution in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.11.
. . The Share Escrow Agent shall be entitled to vote all Excess Shares. The Share Escrow Agent shall be instructed by the Corporation to vote, consent or assent the Excess Shares as follows: (i) if the matter concerned is the election of directors, the Share Escrow Agent shall vote, consent or assent the whole number of Excess Shares held by the Share Escrow Agent for each director by multiplying the number of votes held in escrow by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Nonaffiliated Votes cast for the director and the denominator of which is the number of Nonaffiliated Votes that could have been cast in the election of the director and are present in person or by proxy at the meeting; (ii) where the matter under the Corporation Law or these Articles of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Corporation requires at least an absolute majority of all outstanding shares of Common Stock in order to be effected, then the Share Escrow Agent shall vote, assent or consent all of such Excess Shares in favor of or in opposition to such matter as the majority of all Nonaffiliated Votes are cast; and (iii) on all other matters, the Share Escrow Agent shall at all times vote, assent or consent all of such shares in the identical proportion in favor of or in opposition to such matter as Nonaffiliated Votes are cast. If any calculation of votes under the preceding sentence would require a fractional vote, the Share Escrow Agent shall vote the next lower number of whole Excess Shares. The Share Escrow Agent shall use all reasonable commercial efforts to ensure, with respect to Excess Shares, that such Excess Shares are counted as being present for the purposes of any quorum required for stockholder action of the Corporation and to vote as set forth above. For purposes of these Articles of Incorporation, "Nonaffiliated Votes" shall mean the votes cast by stockholders other than any Share Escrow Agent with respect to Excess Shares.
Section 9.9
Voting of Excess Shares

Section 9.10
Sale of Excess Shares
(a) In an orderly fashion so as not to materially adversely affect the price of Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange or, if Common Stock is not listed on the New York Stock Exchange, on the exchange or other principal market on which Common Stock is traded, the Share Escrow Agent shall sell or cause the sale of Excess Shares at such time or times as the Share Escrow Agent determines to be appropriate. The Share Escrow Agent shall have the right to take such actions as the Share Escrow Agent deems appropriate to seek to restrict sale of the shares to Permitted Transferees.
(b) The Share Escrow Agent shall have the power to convey to the purchaser of any Excess Shares sold by the Share Escrow Agent ownership of the Excess Shares free of any interest of the Purported Owner of those Excess Shares and free of any other adverse interest arising through the Purported Owner.
 
(c) Upon acquisition by any Permitted Transferee of any Excess Shares sold by the Share Escrow Agent or the Purported Owner, such shares shall upon such sale cease to be Excess Shares and shall become regular shares of Capital Stock in the class to which the Excess Shares belong, and the purchaser of such shares shall acquire such shares free of any claims of the Share Escrow Agent or the Purported Owner.
(d) To the extent permitted by law, none of the Corporation, the Share Escrow Agent or anyone else shall have any liability to the Purported Owner or anyone else by reason of any action or inaction the Corporation or the Share Escrow Agent shall take which either shall in good faith believe to be within the scope of its authority under this Article IX or by reason of any decision as to when or how to sell any Excess Shares or by reason of any other action or inaction in connection with activities under this Article IX which docs not constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting by implication the scope of the preceding sentence, to the extent permitted by law, (a) neither the Share Escrow Agent nor the Corporation shall have any liability on grounds that either failed to take actions which would have produced higher proceeds for any of the Excess Shares or by reason of the manner or timing for any disposition of any Excess Shares and (b) the Share Escrow Agent shall not be deemed to be a fiduciary or Agent of any Purported Owner.

Exhibit 3.2
. . Annual meetings of the shareholders of the Corporation shall be held each year commencing in 2002, on such date, at such hour and at such place within or without the State of Indiana as shall be designated by the Board of Directors. In the absence of designation, the meeting shall be held at the principal office of the Corporation.
Section 1.1
Annual Meetings
. . Special meetings of the shareholders of the Corporation may be called at any time only by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the Presiding Director, the Chief Executive Officer or the President. The Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the Presiding Director, the Chief Executive Officer or the President, as the case may be, calling a special meeting of shareholders shall set the date, time and place of such meeting, which may be held within or without the State of Indiana.
Section 1.2
Special Meetings
. . A written notice, stating the date, time, and place of any meeting of the shareholders, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which such meeting is called, shall be delivered, mailed or sent by electronic transmission by the Secretary of the Corporation, to each shareholder of record of the Corporation entitled to notice of or to vote at such meeting no fewer than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting. Notice of shareholders' meetings, if mailed, shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to each shareholder at his or her address shown in the Corporation's current record of shareholders.
Section 1.3
Notices
Notice of a meeting of shareholders shall be given to shareholders not entitled to vote, but only if a purpose for the meeting is to vote on any amendment to the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation, merger, or share exchange to which the Corporation would be a party, sale of the Corporation's assets, dissolution of the Corporation, or consideration of voting rights to be accorded to shares acquired or to be acquired in a "control share acquisition" (as such term is defined in the Indiana Business Corporation Law). Except as required by the foregoing sentence or as otherwise required by the Indiana Business Corporation Law or the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation, notice of a meeting of shareholders is required to be given only to shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting.
A shareholder or his or her proxy may at any time waive notice of a meeting if the waiver is in writing and is delivered to the Corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the Corporation's records. A shareholder's attendance at a meeting, whether in person or by proxy, (a) waives objection to lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless the shareholder or his proxy at the beginning of the meeting objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting, and (b) waives objection to consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, unless the shareholder or his proxy objects to considering the matter when it is presented. Each shareholder who has, in the manner above provided, waived notice or objection to notice of a shareholders' meeting shall be conclusively presumed to have been given due notice of such meeting, including the purpose or purposes thereof.
If an annual or special shareholders' meeting is adjourned to a different date, time, or place, notice need not be given of the new date, time, or place if the new date, time, or place is announced at the meeting before adjournment, unless a new record date is or must be established for the adjourned meeting.
. . At each annual meeting, the shareholders shall elect the directors and shall conduct only such other business as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be (a) specified in the notice of the meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (c) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a shareholder of the Corporation who (i) was a shareholder of record at the time of giving the notice provided for in this Section 1.4, (ii) is entitled to vote at the meeting, and (iii) complied with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 1.4. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive office of the Corporation. To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting and in the case of the annual meeting to be held in 2002, by January 31, 2002; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than 30 days or delayed by more than 60 days from such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder, to be timely, must be so delivered not earlier than the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement (as defined herein) of the date of such meeting is first made.
Section 1.4
Business of Shareholder Meetings
Such shareholder's notice shall set forth as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such shareholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; (b) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made (i) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and the name and address of such beneficial owner, (ii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record
 
by such shareholder and such beneficial owner as of the date such notice is given, and (iii) a representation that such shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business; (c) in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend either the Articles of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment; and (d) if the shareholder intends to solicit proxies in support of such shareholder's proposal, a representation to that effect. The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a shareholder if the shareholder has notified the Corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting and such shareholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by management of the Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting; provided, however, that if such shareholder does not appear or send a qualified representative to present such proposal at such annual meeting, the Corporation need not present such proposal for a vote at such meeting, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. Notwithstanding anything in these By-Laws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with this Section 1.4, and the Chairman of the Board or other person presiding at an annual meeting of shareholders may refuse to permit any business to be brought before an annual meeting without compliance with the foregoing procedures or if the shareholder solicits proxies in support of such shareholder's proposal without such shareholder having made the representation required by clause (d) of the second preceding sentence.
For the purposes of this Section 1.4, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). In addition to the provisions of this Section 1.4, a shareholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth herein. Nothing in these By-Laws shall be deemed to affect any rights of the shareholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.
In no event shall the adjournment of a meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above.
. . Nominations of persons for election as Directors may be made by the Board of Directors or by any shareholder who is a shareholder of record at the time of giving the notice of nomination provided for in this Section 1.5 and who is entitled to vote in the election of Directors. Any shareholder of record entitled to vote in the election of Directors at a meeting may nominate a person or persons for election as Directors only if timely written notice of such shareholder's intent to make such nomination is given to the Secretary of the Corporation in accordance with the procedures for bringing business before an annual meeting set forth in Section 1.4 of these By-Laws. To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered (i) with respect to an election to be held at an annual meeting of shareholders, not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting and in the case of the annual meeting to be held in 2002, by January 31, 2002; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than 30 days or delayed by more than 60 days from such
Section 1.5
Notice of Shareholder Nominations
 
anniversary date, notice by the shareholder, to be timely, must be so delivered not earlier than the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement (as defined for purposes of Section 1.4 of these By-Laws) is first made of the date of such meeting, and (ii) with respect to an election to be held at a special meeting of shareholders, not earlier than the 120th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees to be elected at such meeting.
Such shareholder's notice shall set forth: (a) the name and address of the shareholder who intends to make the nomination, of the person or persons to be nominated and of the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made; (b) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting in such election and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (c) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the shareholder, any such beneficial owner, each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the shareholder; (d) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such shareholder as would have been required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission had each nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board of Directors; (e) the consent of each nominee to serve as a Director if so elected; and (f) if the shareholder intends to solicit proxies in support of such shareholder's nominee(s), a representation to that effect. The chairman of any meeting of shareholders to elect Directors and the Board of Directors may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure or if the shareholder solicits proxies in support of such shareholder's nominee(s) without such shareholder having made the representation required by clause (f) of the preceding sentence. In addition to the provisions of this Section 1.5, a shareholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth herein.
. . Except as otherwise provided by the Indiana Business Corporation Law or the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation, each share of Common Stock of the Corporation that is outstanding at the record date established for any annual or special meeting of shareholders and is outstanding at the time of and represented in person or by proxy at the annual or special meeting, shall entitle the record holder thereof, or his proxy, to one (1) vote on each matter voted on at the meeting.
Section 1.6
Voting
. . Unless the Indiana Business Corporation Law provides otherwise, at all meetings of shareholders, twenty-five percent (25%) of the votes entitled to be cast on a matter, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum for action on the matter. Action may be taken at a shareholders' meeting only on matters with respect to which a quorum exists; provided, however, that any meeting of shareholders, including annual and special meetings and any adjournments thereof, may be adjourned to a later date although less than a quorum is present. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for that adjourned meeting.
Section 1.7
Quorum
 
. . If a quorum exists as to a matter to be considered at a meeting of shareholders, action on such matter (other than the election of Directors) is approved if the votes properly cast favoring the action exceed the votes properly cast opposing the action, except as the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation or the Indiana Business Corporation Law require a greater number of affirmative votes. The standard for the election of Directors by the Corporation's shareholders is set forth in the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation. Any nominee for Director who is an incumbent Director and who does not receive a majority of the votes cast (as defined in the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation) shall immediately tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors, if not previously tendered in connection with his or her election. The Governance Committee will then make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept the tendered resignation or to take other action.
Section 1.8
Vote Required To Take Action
. . Only such persons shall be entitled to notice of or to vote, in person or by proxy, at any shareholders' meeting as shall appear as shareholders upon the books of the Corporation as of such record date as the Board of Directors shall determine, which date may not be earlier than the date seventy (70) days immediately preceding the meeting. In the absence of such determination, the record date shall be the fiftieth (50th) day immediately preceding the date of such meeting. Unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors, shareholders shall be determined as of the close of business on the record date.
Section 1.9
Record Date
. . A shareholder may vote his or her shares either in person or by proxy. A shareholder may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the shareholder (including authorizing the proxy to receive, or to waive, notice of any shareholders' meeting within the effective period of such proxy) by signing an appointment form, either personally or by the shareholder's attorney-in-fact. An appointment of a proxy is effective when received by the Secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes and is effective for eleven (11) months unless a longer period is expressly provided in the appointment form. The proxy's authority may be limited to a particular meeting or may be general and authorize the proxy to represent the shareholder at any meeting of shareholders held within the time provided in the appointment form. Subject to the Indiana Business Corporation Law and to any express limitation on the proxy's authority appearing on the face of the appointment form, the Corporation is entitled to accept the proxy's vote or other action as that of the shareholder making the appointment.
Section 1.10
Proxies
. . The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of any share or shares of stock of the Corporation, as recorded on the stock record or transfer books of the Corporation, as the holder of record and as the holder and owner in fact thereof and, accordingly, shall not be required to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share(s) on the part of any other person, firm, partnership, corporation or association, whether or not the Corporation shall have express or other notice thereof, save as is otherwise expressly required by law, and the term "shareholder" as used in these By-Laws means one who is a holder of record of shares of the Corporation.
Section 1.11

Removal of Directors
. . Any action required or permitted to be taken at a shareholders' meeting may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all the shareholders entitled to vote on the action. The action must be evidenced by one (1) or more written consents, in one or more counterparts, describing the action taken, signed by all the shareholders entitled to vote on the action, and delivered to the Corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records reflecting the action taken. Action taken under this Section 1.12 is effective when the last shareholder signs the consent, unless the consent specifies a different prior or subsequent effective date, in which case the action is effective on or as of the specified date. Executed consents returned to the Corporation by facsimile transmission may be relied upon as, and shall have the same effect as, originals of such consents. A consent signed under this Section 1.12 shall have the same effect as a unanimous vote of all shareholders and may be described as such in any document.

Section 1.14
Participation Other Than in Person
 
. . The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed under the direction of a Board of Directors consisting of at least five (5) Directors, but not more than nineteen (19) Directors, with the actual number of Directors being fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors. The Directors shall be divided into three (3) groups, with each group consisting of one-third (1/3) of the total Directors, as near as may be, with the term of office of the first group to expire at the annual meeting of shareholders in 2002, the term of office of the second group to expire at the annual meeting of shareholders in 2003, and the term of office of the third group to expire at the annual meeting of shareholders in 2004; and at each annual meeting of shareholders, the Directors chosen to succeed those whose terms then expire shall be identified as being of the same group as the Directors they succeed and shall be elected for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting of shareholders.
Section 2.1
Number and Terms
Despite the expiration of a Director's term, the Director shall continue to serve until his or her successor is elected and qualified, or until the earlier of his or her death, resignation, disqualification or removal, or until there is a decrease in the number of Directors. Any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors, from whatever cause arising, shall be filled by selection of a successor by a majority vote of the remaining members (although less than a quorum) of the Board of Directors who then qualify as Continuing Directors (as such term is defined for purposes of Article VIII of the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation); provided, however, that if such vacancy or vacancies leave the Board of Directors with no members who then qualify as Continuing Directors or if the remaining members of the Board who then qualify as Continuing Directors are unable to agree upon a successor or determine not to select a successor, such vacancy may be filled by a vote of the shareholders at a special meeting called for that purpose or at the next annual meeting of shareholders. The term of a Director elected or selected to fill a vacancy shall expire at the end of the term for which such Director's predecessor was elected, or if the vacancy arises because of an increase in the size of the Board of Directors, at the end of the term specified at the time of election or selection.
The Directors and each of them shall have no authority to bind the Corporation except when acting as a Board.
. . A majority of the whole Board of Directors shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business, except the filling of vacancies.

. . Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of the Board, the Presiding Director, the Chief Executive Officer or by one quarter (1/4) of the whole authorized number of Directors, upon not less than twenty-four (24) hours' notice given to each Director of the date, time, and place of the meeting, which notice need not specify the purpose or purposes of the special meeting. Such notice may be communicated in person (either in writing or orally), by telephone, telegraph, teletype, or other form of wire or wireless communication, or by mail, and shall be effective at the earlier of the time of its receipt or, if mailed, three (3) days after its mailing. Notice of any meeting of the Board may be waived in writing at any time if the waiver is signed by the Director entitled to the notice and is filed with the minutes or corporate records. A Director's attendance at or participation in a meeting waives any required notice to the Director of the meeting, unless the Director at the beginning of the meeting (or promptly upon the Director's arrival) objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting and does not thereafter vote for or assent to action taken at the meeting.
Section 2.4
Special Meetings
. . Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all members of the Board. The action must be evidenced by one (1) or more written consents, in one or more counterparts, describing the action taken, signed by each Director, and included in the minutes or filed with the corporate records reflecting the action taken. Action taken under this Section 2.5 is effective when the last Director signs the consent, unless the consent specifies a different prior or subsequent effective date, in which case the action is effective on or as of the specified date. Executed consents returned to the Corporation by facsimile transmission may be relied upon as, and shall have the same effect as, originals of such consents. A consent signed under this Section 2.5 shall have the same effect as a unanimous vote of all members of the Board and may be described as such in any document.
