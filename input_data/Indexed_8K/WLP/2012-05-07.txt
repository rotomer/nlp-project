On May 7, 2012, WellPoint, Inc. (the "Company") closed its sale of $850 million initial aggregate principal amount of its 3.125% Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes") and $900 million initial aggregate principal amount of its 4.625% Notes due 2042 (the "2042 Notes" and, together with the 2022 Notes, the "Notes") pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated May 2, 2012 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., and the related Terms Agreement, dated May 2, 2012 (the "Terms Agreement"), among the Company and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named in the Terms Agreement (the "Underwriters"). The Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-178394) previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Act.
The aggregate net proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the Notes were approximately $1,722,776,000 after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for working capital and for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, repayment of short-term and long-term debt. The Indenture (defined below) does not prohibit or limit the incurrence of indebtedness and other liabilities by the Company or its subsidiaries.
The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of January 10, 2006 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), as trustee (the "Trustee"). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on November 15 and May 15 of each year, commencing on November 15, 2012. Each interest payment will be made to the persons who are registered holders of the notes on the immediately preceding November 1 and May 1, respectively.
The Notes may be declared immediately due and payable by the Trustee or the holders of 25% of the principal amount of the Notes of the affected series if an event of default occurs under the Indenture and has not been cured. An event of default generally means that the Company (1) fails to pay the principal or any premium on a Note on its due date, (2) does not pay interest on a Note within 30 days of its due date, (3) remains in breach of any other term of the Indenture for 60 days after its receipt of written notice of such failure or (4) files for bankruptcy or certain other events in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occurs.
The 2022 Notes will mature on May 15, 2022 and the 2042 Notes will mature on May 15, 2042. However, the Company, at its option, may redeem the 2022 Notes and the 2042 Notes, in each case, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the applicable Notes being redeemed (not including any portion of the payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to its present value, on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate, as defined in the Notes, plus 20 basis points in the case of the 2022 Notes and 25 basis points in the case of the 2042 Notes, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of redemption.
Unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the 2022 Notes and 2042 Notes in full as described in the preceding paragraph, upon the occurrence of both (i) a change of control of the Company and (2) a downgrade of the Notes below an investment grade rating by each of Moody's Investors Services Inc., Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings Inc. within a specified period, it will be required to make an offer to purchase all of the 2022 Notes and the 2042 Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the 2022 Notes and 2042 Notes, respectively, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.
The Underwriters and certain of their affiliates have provided from time to time, and may provide in the future, investment and commercial banking and financial advisory services to the Company and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received and may continue to receive customary fees and commissions. Affiliates of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and the other Underwriters are participants in the Company's revolving credit agreement.
The foregoing description of the issuance and sale does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, which is incorporated by reference hereto as Exhibit 1.1, and the Indenture, which is incorporated by reference hereto as Exhibit 4.1.
 
The computation of the Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges is attached as Exhibit 12.1 hereto.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
WellPoint, Inc., an Indiana corporation (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell its senior debt securities (the "Debt Securities"), from time to time, in or pursuant to one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of sale.
The Debt Securities will be issued in one or more series as senior indebtedness under an indenture, dated as of January 10, 2006 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly the Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), as trustee (the "Trustee"). Each series of Debt Securities may vary, as applicable, as to title, aggregate principal amount, interest rate or formula and timing of payments thereof, stated maturity date, redemption and/or repayment provisions, sinking fund requirements and any other variable terms established by or pursuant to the Indenture.
Whenever the Company determines to make an offering of Debt Securities through Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (each, a "Representative", and together, the "Representatives"), or through an underwriting syndicate managed by the Representatives, the Company will enter into an agreement (each, a "Terms Agreement") providing for the sale of such Securities to, and the purchase and offering thereof by, the Representatives and such other underwriters, if any, selected by the Company (the "Underwriters", which term shall include the Representatives, whether acting as Underwriters or as a member of an underwriting syndicate, as well as any Underwriter substituted pursuant to Section 10 hereof). The Terms Agreement relating to the offering of Securities shall specify the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be issued (the "Underwritten Securities"), the name of each Underwriter participating in such offering (subject to substitution as provided in Section 10 hereof) and the name of any Underwriter other than the Representatives acting as co-managers in connection with such offering, the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities which each such Underwriter severally agrees to purchase, whether such offering is on a fixed or variable price basis and, if on a fixed price basis, the initial offering price, the price at which the Underwritten Securities are to be purchased by the Underwriters, the form, time, date
and place of delivery and payment of the Underwritten Securities and any other material variable terms of the Underwritten Securities. The Terms Agreement, which shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, may take the form of an exchange of any standard form of written telecommunication between the Company and each Representative, acting for itself and, if applicable, as representative of any other Underwriters. Each offering of Underwritten Securities through the Representatives as Underwriters or through an underwriting syndicate managed by the Representatives will be governed by this Agreement, as supplemented by the applicable Terms Agreement.
The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-178394), which contains a base prospectus (the "Base Prospectus"), to be used in connection with the public offering and sale of the Debt Securities. Such registration statement, as amended, including the financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto, in the form in which it became effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "1933 Act"), including any required information deemed to be a part thereof at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the 1933 Act, is called the "Registration Statement." The term "Prospectus" shall mean the final prospectus supplement relating to the Underwritten Securities, together with the Base Prospectus, that is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) after the date and time that the Terms Agreement is executed and delivered by the parties thereto. The term "Preliminary Prospectus" shall mean any preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Underwritten Securities, together with the Base Prospectus, that is first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b). Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents that are or are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act prior to the Initial Sale Time (as defined in the applicable Terms Agreement). All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing, shall include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR").
All references in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is "contained," "included" or "stated" (or other references of like import) in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is or is deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus, as the case may be, prior to the Initial Sale Time; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus shall be deemed to include the filing of any document under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), which is or is deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus, as the case may be, after the Initial Sale Time.

The Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.
Compliance with Securities Regulations and Commission Requests
(b) . During such period beginning on the date of the applicable Terms Agreement and ending on the later of the Closing Time or such date as, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, the Prospectus is no longer required by law to be delivered in connection with sales of Underwritten Securities by an Underwriter or dealer, including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 of the 1933 Act Regulations (the "Prospectus Delivery Period"), the Company will give the Representatives notice of its intention to file or prepare any amendment to the Registration Statement, or any amendment, supplement or revision to the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, whether pursuant to the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise, will furnish the Representatives with copies of any such documents a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing or use, as the case may be, and will not file or use any such document to which the Representatives or counsel for the Underwriters shall reasonably object.
Filing of Amendments
(c) . The Company has furnished or will deliver to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein) and signed copies of all consents and certificates of experts, and will also deliver to the Representatives, without charge, a conformed copy of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto (without exhibits) for each of the Underwriters.

If at any time during the Prospectus Delivery Period, any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters or for the Company, to amend the Registration Statement in order that the Registration Statement will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or to amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus in order that the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as the case may be, will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing at the Initial Sale Time or at the time it is delivered or conveyed to a purchaser, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary, in the opinion of such counsel, at any such time to amend the Registration Statement or amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company will (1) notify the Representatives of any such event, development or condition and (2) promptly prepare and file with the Commission, subject to Section 3(b) and 3(m) hereof, such amendment or supplement as may be necessary to correct such statement or omission or to make the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus comply with such requirements, and the Company will furnish to the Underwriters, without charge, such number of copies of such amendment or supplement as the Underwriters may reasonably request.
Continued Compliance with Securities Laws

Permitted Free Writing Prospectuses
(m) . If immediately prior to the third anniversary (the "Renewal Deadline") of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, any of the Underwritten Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters, the Company will prior to the Renewal Deadline file, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Underwritten Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives.

References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.

No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) of Section 6 in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Underwritten Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 6(c), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of such Underwritten Securities as set forth on such cover. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include
Contribution
pro rata
 
any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Underwritten Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 7 to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
The obligations of the Company under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of any Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the 1933 Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter, and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the 1933 Act.
SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Underwritten Securities.

Underwriting Agreement
(b) . Prior to the Closing Time, the Representatives may terminate the applicable Terms Agreement by notice given to the Company if at any time there shall have occurred any of the following: (i) a change in U.S. or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls as would, in the judgment of the Representatives, be likely to prejudice materially the success of the proposed issue, sale or distribution of the Underwritten Securities, whether in the primary market or in respect of dealings in the secondary market; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the Exchange; (iii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iv) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; or (v) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis, if the effect of any such event specified in this clause (v) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Underwritten Securities being delivered at the Closing Time on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus.
Terms Agreement
(c) . If this Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 9, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 4, 6, 7, 8 and 13 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.
Liabilities
 
SECTION 10. . If, at the Closing Time, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Underwritten Securities that it or they have agreed to purchase under the applicable Terms Agreement, and the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, in the proportions that the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite their respective names on the applicable Terms Agreement bears to the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as may be specified by the Representatives with the consent of the non-defaulting Underwriters, to purchase the Underwritten Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If, at the Closing Time, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Underwritten Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Underwritten Securities are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Section 4, Section 6, Section 7, Section 8, Section 9 and Section 13 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
Default by One or More of the Underwriters
As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter under this Section 10. Any action taken under this Section 10 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.

"" means, for any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity, computed as of the second Business Day immediately preceding that redemption date, of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that redemption date.

Remaining Scheduled Payments
In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
If less than all the Securities are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the trustee by such method as the trustee deems fair and appropriate. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities or portions thereof called for redemption.
If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Securities in full, the Company will make an offer to each holder (the "Change of Control Offer") to repurchase any and all (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess of $2,000) of such holder's Securities at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment").

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control repurchase provisions of the Securities, the Company will be required to comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control repurchase provisions of the Securities by virtue of such conflicts.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will be required, to the extent lawful, to accept for payment all Securities or portions of Securities properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Securities or portions of Securities properly tendered; and deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Securities properly accepted, together with an officer's certificate stating the principal amount of Securities or portions of Securities being purchased.
The trustee shall have no duty to monitor or determine whether or not a Change of Control Triggering Event (or any of its components) has occurred. The Trustee may conclusively presume that a Change of Control Triggering Event (or any of its components) has not occurred, unless and until notified to the contrary by the Company or by the Holders of the Securities of this series in the manner provided in the Indenture.
For purposes of the foregoing discussion of the applicable Change of Control provisions, the following definitions are applicable:

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as Indiana counsel for WellPoint, Inc., an Indiana corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of $850,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.125% Notes due 2022 and $900,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.625% Notes due 2042 (collectively, the "Notes"). In that capacity we have reviewed:
(a) The Registration Statement on Form S-3, File No. 333-178394, of the Company and the Prospectus constituting a part thereof, dated December 9, 2011, relating to the issuance from time to time of debt and equity securities of the Company pursuant to Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"); and
(b) The Prospectus Supplement, dated May 2, 2012, to the above-mentioned Prospectus relating to the Notes and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to Rule 424 promulgated under the 1933 Act (the "Prospectus Supplement").
For purposes of this opinion letter, we have examined originals or copies, identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, instruments and other relevant materials as we deemed advisable and have made such examination of statutes and decisions and reviewed such questions of law as we have considered necessary or appropriate. In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. As to facts material to this opinion letter, we have relied upon certificates, statements or representations of public officials, of officers and representatives of the Company and of others, without any independent verification thereof.
 
On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Company has the corporate authority under Indiana law to execute and deliver the Notes, and that the Notes have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
We consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by the Company and to the reference to us under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement. In giving such consent, we do not admit that we come within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the 1933 Act or the rules or regulations of the Commission thereunder. We hereby authorize Hogan Lovells US LLP to rely upon this opinion as if it had been addressed to them.
Yours very truly,
/s/ Faegre Baker Daniels LLP
