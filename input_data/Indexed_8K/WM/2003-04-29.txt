ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS. (C) EXHIBITS. 99 Press Release of Waste Management, Inc. dated April 29, 2003. ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE Waste Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), is furnishing this Current Report on Form 8-K to report information pursuant to Item 12 - Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition of Form 8-K. On April 29, 2003, the Company issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2003. A copy of that release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99. The Company has presented its free cash flow for the quarter in the earnings release, which is a "non-GAAP" financial measure under Regulation G. The components of free cash flow are computed by using amounts which are determined in accordance with GAAP. As part of our press release information we have provided a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, which is its nearest comparable GAAP financial measure. However, because our measurement of free cash flow is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP, it is not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Company included its free cash flow in the release because it believes that investors are interested in the cash produced by the Company from non-financing activities that is available for uses such as the Company's acquisition program, its share repurchase program, its scheduled debt reduction and the annual payment of dividends. Free cash flow is defined by the Company as: o Net cash provided by operating activities o Less, capital expenditures o Plus, proceeds from divestitures of businesses, net of cash divested, and other sales of assets -2-

[WASTE MANAGEMENT LOGO] FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC. ANALYSTS: --------- CHERIE RICE 713.512.6548 MEDIA: ------ BILL PLUNKETT 713.265.1678 WMI#03-10 WASTE MANAGEMENT ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER 2003 EARNINGS HOUSTON - APRIL 29, 2003 - Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE: WMI) today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2003. Revenues for the quarter were $2.72 billion as compared to $2.61 billion in the year ago period. Net income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the quarter was $107 million, or $0.18 per share. Net income reported for the quarter after considering the unfavorable cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles of $46 million was $61 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. For the first quarter 2002, the Company reported net income of $138 million, or $0.22 per share, after a favorable cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $2 million. The cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles in 2003 was primarily related to the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations ("SFAS 143"), partially offset by accounting policy changes related to certain maintenance activities and loss contracts. "Other than the challenges related to several heavy winter storms in many of our largest and most populated markets and the rising cost of fuel, our performance in the quarter was on track with our expectations" commented A. Maurice Myers, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waste Management. "Winter is finally over and oil prices are starting to come off their highs, so those challenges should be largely behind us for the second quarter. Additionally, late March and early April volumes are indicating the seasonal upturn that we look for each spring." The Company noted certain items totaling $0.06 per diluted share negatively impacting the current quarter's results: o A pre-tax charge of $20 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, included in the restructuring line, related to the workforce reduction announced in February.
o Negative impact to pre-tax income related to severe winter weather, primarily in the East and the Midwest, estimated at $20 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. o Negative impact to pre-tax income versus prior year related to increased fuel costs, net of fuel surcharges, of $12 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. o A $7 million expense, or $0.01 per diluted share, resulting from the increase in inflation rate the Company uses for its estimates of remedial liability reserves; the increased rate is consistent with the rate used under SFAS 143 as adopted by the Company. In the first quarter of 2002, a pre-tax charge of $37 million was included in the restructuring line, related to a workforce reduction announced in March 2002. Partially offsetting the restructuring charge were credits to asset impairments and unusual items totaling $6 million pre-tax. Combined, these items negatively impacted first quarter 2002 earnings by $31 million pre-tax, or $0.03 per diluted share. In the first quarter of 2003, Waste Management adopted SFAS 143. In accordance with SFAS 143 the Company has changed the methodology for accounting for the retirement of its long-lived assets, primarily its landfills. As a result, on a year-to-year comparative basis, operating costs were $6 million higher and depreciation and amortization costs were $7 million higher in the current quarter than they would have been if the accounting standards were the same as for the first quarter 2002 period. The increased costs related to SFAS 143 reduced earnings by $0.01 per diluted share. Myers added, "In the first quarter we saw the strongest internal revenue growth we have seen in over two years. Especially considering the harsh winter weather in the quarter, we find the internal growth very encouraging. We also continue to implement our cost reduction programs, such as our route optimization effort, and expect further progress during the year. Some other items of importance in the first quarter's results include: effecting the reclassification of expenses from SG&A to cost of operations, better reflecting how we view these costs in terms of our current operations; and kicking off the 2003 share buyback program with the repurchase of $71 million of common stock, or nearly 3.6 million shares." The Company also reported the following important highlights for the quarter: o Operating cash flow of $429 million. o Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures plus proceeds from sales of assets, of $233 million. o Internal revenue growth of 0.8%, split 0.3% price and 0.5% volume. The price component excludes combined positive impacts of 1.4% related to higher recycling commodity prices, higher fuel surcharges, and slightly lower electricity rates at Independent Power Production facilities. o Capital expenditures of $212 million. o Approximately $4 million in savings in the quarter related to the 2003 workforce reduction. o Businesses with annual revenues of approximately $256 million acquired during the quarter for approximately $83 million in cash consideration, including the
previously announced acquisition of the Peltz Group in conjunction with the formation of the Recycle America Alliance.
