EXHIBIT 99.1 (WASTE MANAGEMENT LOGO) FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC. ANALYSTS: CHERIE RICE 713.512.6548 MEDIA: SARAH SIMPSON 713.394.2154 WMI#03-16 WASTE MANAGEMENT ANNOUNCES SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN DIVIDEND AND CHANGE TO A QUARTERLY PAYMENT SCHEDULE PER SHARE DIVIDEND TO INCREASE FROM $0.01 TO $0.75 PER YEAR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND PAYMENT OF $0.1875 TO BEGIN IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2004 HOUSTON - AUGUST 5, 2003 - The Board of Directors of Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE: WMI) today announced the approval of a quarterly dividend program, to begin in the first quarter 2004. "This company is first and foremost a big cash flow generator," said A. Maurice Myers, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waste Management. "The Board of Directors and management of Waste Management consider the allocation of our cash flow, to the benefit of our shareholders, to be one of our most important duties. With the passage of the new tax law regarding dividends, we felt a change in the allocation of capital is now appropriate. "Accordingly, beginning in 2004 we are putting in place a capital allocation program designed to pay our shareholders a dividend of $0.75 per share annually, to be paid on a quarterly basis. Based on current share count, this equates to nearly $450 million. At the current share price of approximately $24.00, such a dividend produces a 3.1% annual yield. Our substantial cash flow will also provide for a continuation of our stock buy back
program, at a level to be determined annually and for the acquisition of selected core, North American solid waste assets that meet our return criteria," Myers said. "This reallocation of the distribution of our free cash flow demonstrates our confidence in the strength and consistency of our cash flow and is a continuation of the Company's disciplined management of its capital with our shareholders' interests as our top priority, and balanced by our commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet," added Myers. The Company noted that it intends to announce the record and payment dates for the first quarterly dividend in late January, with the expectation that payment of the dividend will occur in March. Waste Management, Inc. is its industry's leading provider of comprehensive waste management services. Based in Houston, the Company serves municipal, commercial, industrial, and residential customers throughout North America.

EXHIBIT 99.2 (WASTE MANAGEMENT LOGO) FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC. ANALYSTS: CHERIE RICE 713.512.6548 MEDIA: SARAH SIMPSON 713.394.2154 WMI#03-17 WASTE MANAGEMENT ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2003 EARNINGS OPERATING CASH FLOW STRONG AT $644 MILLION HOUSTON - AUGUST 5, 2003 - Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE: WMI) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2003. Revenues for the quarter were $2.92 billion as compared with $2.82 billion in the year ago period. Net income reported for the quarter was $176 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, compared with net income of $217 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the second quarter 2002. Results for the second quarter 2003 include a pre-tax restructuring charge of $23 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, related to the workforce reduction announced in late June. Without the charge, earnings per diluted share would have been $0.32. In the first quarter of 2003, Waste Management adopted SFAS 143. In accordance with SFAS 143 the Company has changed the methodology for accounting for the retirement of its long-lived assets, primarily its landfills. As a result, on a year-to-year comparative basis, operating costs were $6 million higher and depreciation and amortization costs were $7 million higher in the current quarter than they would have been if the accounting standards were the same as for the second quarter 2002 period. The increased costs related to SFAS 143 reduced earnings by $0.01 per diluted share. For the six months ended June 30, 2003 Waste Management reported operating revenues of $5.63 billion as compared with $5.43 billion for the comparable period last year. Net
income was $237 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.40 for the six months ended June 30, 2003 as compared with $355 million and $0.57, respectively, for the same period in 2002. The 2003 results include the unfavorable impact of cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles of $46 million, or $0.08 per diluted share. "General business conditions in the second quarter remained similar to those that we have seen for the past several quarters. While sequential quarterly revenues increased by 7.3 percent, primarily as a result of seasonality, we don't view that as a sign of an improving economy. Year-over-year, the volume component of internal revenue growth for the second quarter was a negative 0.4 percent. However, that statistic was much improved for the month of June, posting a 1.4% gain, " commented A. Maurice Myers, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waste Management. "We continue to focus on opportunities to lower our cost structure and to add new, profitable revenue streams to our existing base of business. Both our recent workforce reduction and the continued implementation of our routing optimization program should positively impact our cost structure in the second half of the year. Further, the businesses we acquired at the close of the second quarter combined with those expected to close in the third quarter are projected to be immediately accretive to earnings," continued Myers. "While we have made great improvements to this company in the past three years, now is the time for us to execute and maximize Waste Management's operations." The following important highlights for the quarter were reported: o Operating cash flow of $644 million. o Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures plus proceeds from sales of assets, of $373 million.(a) Adjusted for a cash tax benefit related to the anticipated payment of the class action lawsuit settlement, free cash flow was $307 million in the quarter. o Internal revenue growth of 0.2%, split 0.6% price and negative 0.4% volume. The price component excludes combined positive impacts of 0.7% related to higher fuel surcharges, higher recycling commodity prices, and slightly higher electricity rates at Independent Power Production facilities. o Capital expenditures of $289 million. o Selling, General & Administrative costs were 10.3% of revenue. The Company noted that for 2003 it continues to expect to produce $900 million to $1 billion of adjusted free cash flow (before considering the net after-tax cash outflow to pay the settlement of the shareholder class action lawsuit, estimated at approximately $220 million and expected to be paid in the third quarter ), and expressed comfort with the current range of earnings estimates as reported by Multex and First Call. (a) The Company included its free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, herein because it believes that investors are interested in the cash produced by the Company from non-financing activities that is available for uses such as the Company's acquisition program, its share repurchase program, its scheduled debt reduction and the payment of dividends. Free cash flow is defined by the Company as: o Net cash provided by operating activities
o Less, capital expenditures o Plus, proceeds from divestitures of businesses, net of cash divested, and other sales of assets The Company's definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
