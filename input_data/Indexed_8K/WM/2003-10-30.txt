Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE: WMI) today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2003. Revenues for the quarter were $2.98 billion as compared with $2.90 billion in the year ago period. Net income reported for the quarter was $210 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared with net income of $231 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the third quarter 2002.
HOUSTON  October 30, 2003 
In the first quarter of 2003, Waste Management adopted SFAS No. 143 - Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, and also changed its accounting for loss contracts and for certain repair and maintenance activities at its waste-to-energy and IPP plants. If the accounting changes implemented during 2003 had been effective in 2002, diluted earnings per share would have been lower than reported amounts by $0.02 for the third quarter of 2002 and $0.06 for the nine months ended September 30, 2002.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, Waste Management reported operating revenues of $8.61 billion as compared with $8.33 billion for the comparable period last year. Net income was $447 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.75 for the current year nine-month period, as compared with $586 million and $0.94, respectively, for the same period in 2002. The 2003 results include the unfavorable impact of cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles of $46 million, or $0.08 per diluted share.
 
"The Company continued to make progress on many fronts during the third quarter, including pricing, SG&A costs, and our route optimization program," stated A. Maurice Myers, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waste Management. "Revenue growth from base pricing, which excludes our commodity-related changes, was the highest we have seen in several quarters, at 0.8%. This improvement is due, in part, to a reinvigorated price increase program, which will continue into the fourth quarter. SG&A expense as a percent of revenue for the quarter was 10.0%, a 140 basis point reduction from the prior year quarter. Reducing SG&A to this level has been an important long-term goal of ours, and it is rewarding to see our employees' efforts to reduce costs pay off in such a visible way and earlier than our expectations.
"The WasteRoute program to optimize our residential and commercial routes continues to move forward at a very encouraging pace. As of early October we are confident that we will achieve our stated 2003 goal of eliminating 750 full routes. The amount of the savings associated with eliminating a route, estimated at about $10,000 per route per month on the average, is slower to be realized than initially anticipated. We continue to believe that we can realize the originally targeted savings over time and are working diligently towards that end," Myers added.
The following important highlights for the quarter were reported:
The Company stated that it is still comfortable with the analysts' range of estimates for the full-year, which is currently $1.20 to $1.30 diluted earnings per share according to Reuters. The Company's guidance for adjusted free cash flow for the year has been $900 million to $1 billion, and at this time it expects a minimum of $950 million for the full year. This expectation is based on full-year projected capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 billion and proceeds from divestitures of businesses, net of cash divested, and other sales of assets of approximately $60 million, and the net cash impact associated with the payment of the class action settlement of approximately $225 million.
