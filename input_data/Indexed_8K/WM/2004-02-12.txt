Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure
     The Company held an analyst conference call on February 12, 2004 to discuss its fourth quarter 2003 financial results and 2004 guidance. On that call, A. Maurice Myers, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, announced that he would adopt a trading plan in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Company's policies with respect to insider trades. This means the plan would be adopted as soon as the Company's trading window opens, which is expected to occur on February 16th. The plan will be used by Mr. Myers to diversify his Waste Management holdings as a part of estate and tax planning activities.
     Under Mr. Myers' 10b5-1 plan, he will sell up to 187,000 shares he received as a restricted stock grant in 1999. The sales will be made over the next nine months pursuant to a predetermined formula. Additionally, Mr. Myers announced his intention to exercise options he owns in Waste Management common stock, holding the shares acquired in accordance with the Company's stock ownership guidelines.
     Mr. Myers has previously announced that he will be retiring from Waste Management at the end of the term of his employment contract, which is in November of this year. He has stated that he intends to move from Houston, Texas, where the Company is headquartered. Texas has no state income tax and therefore, Mr. Myers' tax planning includes recognizing income from stock sales and options exercises while still a resident of Texas.
     Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate insiders to establish prearranged stock trading plans when they are not in possession of material non-public information, and allows such prearranged trades to be made pursuant to the plan regardless of any subsequent material information that the insider may receive. 10b5-1 plans allow insiders to gradually change their investment portfolio to minimize the market effect of stock trades by spreading them out over a period of time and at the same time avoiding concerns about initiating trades while in possession of material nonpublic information.

For Further Information: Waste Management, Inc. Analysts: Cherie Rice 713.512.6548 Media: Sarah Simpson 713.394.2154 WMI #04-07
Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE: WMI) today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2003. Revenues for the quarter were $2.97 billion as compared with $2.81 billion in the year ago period. Net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle reported for the quarter was $226 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared with $236 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2002. The 2002 quarter included three significant items worth noting: a $43 million pre-tax gain on the sale of an investment, a $31 million tax expense reduction, and $26 million in pre-tax costs related to the settlement of a legal dispute. Combined, these three items improved fourth quarter 2002 diluted earnings per share by $0.07. The 2003 quarter included $17 million of pre-tax income related to a litigation settlement and a lower than previously anticipated effective tax rate, improving fourth quarter 2003 diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.04. Net income reported for the 2003 quarter was $183 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, after considering a $43 million unfavorable cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the application of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, ("FIN 46") to special purpose type variable interest entities.

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
For the full year 2003, Waste Management reported operating revenues of $11.57 billion, compared with $11.14 billion in 2002. Net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principles for the year was $719 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, compared with $820 million and $1.33 for the year 2002. Net income after considering cumulative effect of change in accounting principles was $630 million for 2003 and $822 million for 2002.
In the first quarter of 2003, Waste Management adopted SFAS No.143  , and also changed its accounting for loss contracts and for certain repair

and maintenance activities at its waste-to-energy and Independent Power Production plants. If the accounting changes implemented during 2003 had been effective in 2002, diluted earnings per share in 2002 would have been lower than reported amounts by $0.02 for the fourth quarter of 2002 and $0.08 for the full year.
"2003 was a year of great progress at Waste Management," commented A. Maurice Myers, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "I believe we have terrific momentum heading into 2004, and we are focused on leveraging that momentum in the coming year. There were a number of significant accomplishments during the year. While revenues increased by $432 million, Selling, General and Administrative costs were reduced by $176 million, to 10.5% of revenue. We generated over $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow (a). And, through our pricing program we implemented and retained $13 million of monthly price increases, or $156 million of annualized increases, on our commercial and industrial open-market collection customer base."
Key Highlights for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year
Myers added, "General economic indicators were largely positive during the course of the fourth quarter. Similarly, the volume component of our internal revenue growth was improved as compared to the negative trends we have seen in the prior quarters. The first quarter, our seasonally slowest quarter in terms of business volumes, is not looking very robust so far, with harsh winter storms in certain of our key markets. Our focus at this time remains on improving the performance of our bottom quartile performers, as measured by key performance metrics. As a team, we can and will continue our efforts to improve our efficiencies and reduce our costs while at the same time raising prices. However, it is generally believed that volumes in this industry lag broad economic results by six to nine months. An economic-related rebound to our volumes in 2004 would be an unplanned positive occurrence."
