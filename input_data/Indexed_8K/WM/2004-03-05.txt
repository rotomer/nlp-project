     (v) Arthur Andersen LLP, who certified certain financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and delivered their report with respect to the audited consolidated financial statements and schedules included in the Final Prospectus, at the time they certified such financial statements and delivered their report, were independent public accountants with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder.
     (w) There were no material weaknesses in the Company's system of internal controls over accounting and financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2001, other than those material weaknesses that were subsequently (1) improved to control deficiency status, (2) classified as a business improvement opportunity, or (3) otherwise resolved, in each case such that they no longer constituted an internal control issue with respect to the applicable period.
     (x) Ernst & Young LLP, who has certified certain financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and delivered their report with respect to the audited consolidated financial statements and schedules included in the Final Prospectus, are independent public accountants with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder.
     (y) Each of the Company and Holdings has filed all foreign, federal, state and local tax returns that are required to be filed or has requested extensions thereof (except
 
in any case in which the failure so to file would not have a Material Adverse Effect, and except as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto)) and has paid all taxes required to be paid by it and any other assessment, fine or penalty levied against it, to the extent that any of the foregoing is due and payable, except for any such assessment, fine or penalty that is currently being contested in good faith or as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, and except as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
     (z) No labor problem or dispute with the employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries exists or is threatened or imminent, nor is the Company aware of any existing or imminent labor disturbance by the employees of any of its or its subsidiaries' principal suppliers, contractors or customers, that could have a Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
     (aa) Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect: the Company and each of its Subsidiaries are insured by insurers of recognized financial responsibility against such losses and risks and in such amounts as are prudent and customary in the businesses in which they are engaged; all policies of insurance insuring the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, assets, employees, officers and directors are in full force and effect; the Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of such policies and instruments; there are no claims by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any such policy or instrument as to which any insurance company is denying liability or defending under a reservation of rights clause; and neither the Company nor any such Subsidiary has been refused any insurance coverage sought or applied for, except in each case as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto). Neither the Company nor any such Subsidiary has any reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to continue its business at a cost that would not have a Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
     (bb) No Subsidiary is currently prohibited, directly or indirectly, from paying any dividends to the Company, from making any other distribution on such Subsidiary's capital stock, from repaying to the Company any loans or advances to such Subsidiary from the Company or from transferring any of such Subsidiary's property or assets to the Company or any other Subsidiary of the Company, except as described or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
     (cc) Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, the Company and its subsidiaries possess all licenses, certificates, permits and other authorizations issued by the appropriate federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities necessary to conduct their respective businesses, and neither the Company nor any such subsidiary has received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any such certificate, authorization or permit, which, singly or in the aggregate, if the subject of an unfavorable
 
decision, ruling or finding, would have a Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
     (dd) The Company and each of its subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain asset accountability; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.
     (ee) Neither the Company nor Holdings has taken, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company or Holdings to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.
     (ff) The Company and its subsidiaries (i) are in compliance with any and all applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and safety, the environment or hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, pollutants or contaminants ("Environmental Laws"), (ii) have received and are in compliance with all permits, licenses or other approvals required of them under applicable Environmental Laws to conduct their respective businesses and (iii) have not received notice of any actual or potential liability for the investigation or remediation of any disposal or release of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, pollutants or contaminants, except where such non-compliance with Environmental Laws, failure to receive required permits, licenses or other approvals, or liability would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto). The environmental reserves described or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus reflect in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the known liabilities and obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries under Environmental Laws.
     (gg) In the ordinary course of its business, the Company periodically reviews the effect of Environmental Laws on the business, operations and properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, in the course of which it identifies and evaluates associated costs and liabilities (including, without limitation, any capital or operating expenditures required for clean-up, closure of properties or compliance with Environmental Laws, or any permit, license or approval, any related constraints on operating activities and any potential liabilities to third parties). On the basis of such review, the Company has reasonably concluded that such associated costs and liabilities would not, singly or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
 
     (hh) Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, each of the Company and its subsidiaries has fulfilled its obligations, if any, under the minimum funding standards of Section 302 of the United States Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder with respect to each "plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA and such regulations and published interpretations) in which employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to participate and each such plan is in compliance with the presently applicable provisions of ERISA and such regulations and published interpretations. Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, the Company and its subsidiaries have not incurred any unpaid liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (other than for the payment of premiums in the ordinary course) or to any such plan under Title IV of ERISA.
     (ii) No holders of securities of the Company or Holdings have rights to the registration of such securities under the Registration Statement.
     (jj) The principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or any related rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission, and the statements contained in any such certification are true and correct in all material respects.
     (kk) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act), which (i) were designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, was made known to the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of the Company by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 was being prepared; (ii) have been evaluated for effectiveness as of the end of the periods covered by the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003; and (iii) are effective to ensure that the Company is able to collect, process and disclose the information required to be disclosed in reports filed with the Commission within required time periods.
     (ll) Based on the evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by the Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003, and other than as has been disclosed to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors of the Company, the Company is not aware of (i) any significant deficiency in the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect its ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data or any material weaknesses in internal controls; or (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the internal controls of the Company.
     (mm) Since December 31, 2003, there have been no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.
 
     (nn) Other than Holdings, no subsidiary of the Company has guaranteed any outstanding senior indebtedness of the Company except for guarantees made in the ordinary course of business.
de minimis
     Any certificate signed by any officer of the Company or Holdings and delivered to the Representatives or counsel for the Underwriters in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company or Holdings, as the case may be, as to matters covered thereby, to each Underwriter.
     2. Purchase and Sale. Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Company agrees to sell to each Underwriter, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at the purchase price set forth in Schedule I hereto, the principal amount of the Securities set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in Schedule II hereto.
     3. Delivery and Payment. Delivery of and payment for the Securities shall be made on the date and at the time specified in Schedule I hereto or at such time on such later date not more than three Business Days after the foregoing date as the Representatives shall designate, which date and time may be postponed by agreement between the Representatives and the Company or as provided in Section 9 hereof (such date and time of delivery and payment for the Securities being herein called the "Closing Date"). Delivery of the Securities shall be made to the Representatives for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters against payment by the several Underwriters through the Representatives of the purchase price thereof to or upon the order of the Company by wire transfer payable in same-day funds to an account specified by the Company. Delivery of the Securities shall be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company unless the Representatives shall otherwise instruct.
     4. Offering by Underwriters. It is understood that the several Underwriters propose to offer the Securities for sale to the public as set forth in the Final Prospectus.
     5. Agreements. The Company agrees with the several Underwriters that:
     (a) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company will not file any amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement (including the Final Prospectus) to the Basic Prospectus or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement unless the Company has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object. Subject to the foregoing sentence, if the filing of the Final Prospectus is otherwise required under Rule 424(b), the Company will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filing. The Company will promptly advise the Representatives (1) when the Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) or when any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have been filed with the Commission, (2) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (3) of any request by the
 
Commission or its staff for any amendment to the Registration Statement, or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, or for any supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (4) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (5) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the suspension of any such qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.
     (b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Company promptly will (1) notify the Representatives of such event, (2) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance and (3) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
     (c) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act.
     (d) The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, signed or conformed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and to each other Underwriter a copy of the Registration Statement (without exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act, as many copies of the Final Prospectus and any supplement thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering.
     (e) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will pay any fee of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., in connection with its review of the offering; that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to tax or service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
provided
 
     (f) The Company will not, without the prior written consent of Barclays Capital Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any affiliate of the Company) directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any debt securities (excluding commercial paper or bank borrowings) issued or guaranteed by the Company (other than the Securities) or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, until the Business Day set forth on Schedule I hereto.
     (g) Neither the Company nor Holdings will take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.

     (ii) this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and Holdings;
 
     (iii) the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee) constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting enforcement of creditors' rights and remedies generally and except as enforcement thereof is subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law);
     (iv) the global certificate representing the Notes is in a form authorized by the Indenture, the Notes have been duly authorized by the Company and, assuming the global certificate representing the Notes has been authenticated by the Trustee in the manner provided for in the Indenture and delivered against payment of the consideration therefor specified in this Agreement, the Notes constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting enforcement of creditors' rights and remedies generally and except as enforcement thereof is subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and each registered holder thereof is entitled to the benefits of the Indenture;
     (v) the Guarantee Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Holdings and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Holdings, enforceable against Holdings in accordance with its terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting enforcement of creditors' rights and remedies generally except as enforcement thereof is subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law);
     (vi) the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act;
     (vii) the Securities and the Indenture conform as to legal matters in all material respects to the descriptions thereof contained in the Final Prospectus;
     (viii) the Registration Statement has been declared effective under the Act; any required filing of the Final Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b); and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened under the Act;
 
     (ix) no authorization, approval, consent or license of any regulatory body or authority (other than under the Act, the Trust Indenture Act and the securities or Blue Sky laws of the various states) and no approval of the stockholders of the Company or Holdings is required for the valid authorization, issuance, sale and delivery of the Securities by the Company or Holdings, or for the performance of the Indenture;
     (x) the execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Underwriting Agreement and compliance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture do not and will not conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, the charter or by-laws of the Company, Holdings or Wheelabrator Technologies Inc., or any indenture, mortgage or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or its subsidiaries is a party or by which they or any of their property is bound which is filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or to any of the documents incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus, or any existing applicable laws, rule, regulation (excluding any state securities or state or federal anti-fraud law, rule or regulation);
     (xi) neither the Company nor Holdings is an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company," as such terms are defined in the 1940 Act; and
     (xii) neither the Company nor any subsidiary is a "holding company" or a "public utility," as such terms are defined in the 1935 Act.
     Such counsel shall state that the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein and the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data included therein or omitted therefrom and the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 (the "Form T-1"), as to which such counsel need not express a view, as of the dates they became effective or issue dates, as the case may be, appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects with the requirements of the Act.
     In addition, such counsel shall state that they have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, counsel employed by the Company, representatives of the independent public accountants of the Company, representatives of the Underwriters and counsel to the Underwriters at which the contents of the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus were discussed and, although such counsel did not independently verify such information and is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (other than as set forth in paragraph (vii) above), on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to such counsel's attention that led such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement (other than the financial statements, the notes thereto and the auditors' reports thereon and the related schedules and the other financial and accounting data included or incorporated by
 
reference therein, or omitted therefrom, and the exhibits thereto, as to which such counsel need not comment) as of the Effective Date and the Closing Date contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Final Prospectus (other than the financial statements, the notes thereto and the auditors' reports thereon and the other financial and accounting data included or incorporated by reference therein, or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need not comment) as of its issue date or the Closing Date contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     In rendering such opinions, such counsel may (A) state that the opinions are based on and limited to the contract law of the State of New York, the laws of the State of Texas, the General Corporation Law of Delaware and the Federal laws of the United States, and (B) rely, as to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (b) include any supplements thereto at the Closing Date.
     (c) Rick L. Wittenbraker, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Assistant Corporate Secretary of the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives his opinion, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, to the effect that:
     (i) each of the corporate Subsidiaries organized under United States law is a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Final Prospectus, except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect; except as otherwise disclosed in the Registration Statement or set forth in the opinion, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each of the Subsidiaries is validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, all of such shares of stock owned by the Company are owned free and clear of any security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance, claim or equity; none of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Subsidiaries was issued in violation of the preemptive or similar rights of any security holder thereof;
     (ii) the documents incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus (other than the financial statements, related schedules and other financial data included therein or omitted therefrom, as to which he need express no opinion, and except to the extent that any statement therein is modified or superseded in the Final Prospectus), as of the dates they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder;
     (iii) except as set forth in the Final Prospectus (or incorporated by reference therein), such counsel does not know of any action, suit, proceeding,
 
inquiry or investigation pending or threatened against the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or to which the property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject, before or brought by any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, in which there is a reasonable probability of a Material Adverse Effect;
     (iv) such counsel does not know of any statutes or regulations or any pending or threatened legal or governmental proceedings required to be described in the Final Prospectus which are not described as required, nor of any material contracts or documents of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus or to be filed or incorporated as exhibits to the Registration Statement which are not described and filed or incorporated as required;
     (v) such counsel does not know of any holders of securities of the Company or Holdings that have rights to the registration of such securities under the Registration Statement; and
     (vi) the execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, the Notes, the Guarantee Agreement, and the execution and performance of the Indenture (the "Operative Agreements"), the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Operative Agreements and compliance with the terms of the Operative Agreement do not and will not conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, the charter or by-laws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of such counsel, any indenture, mortgage or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party or by which they or any of their property is bound, or any existing applicable laws, rule, regulation (excluding any state securities or state or federal anti-fraud law, rule or regulation), or, to the knowledge of such counsel, any judgment, order or decree of any government, governmental instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their properties, that in any case would have a Material Adverse Effect.
     (d) The Representatives shall have received from Vinson & Elkins L.L.P., counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
     (e) Each of the Company and Holdings shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate, signed by the principal legal officer and the vice president and treasurer of the Company in the case of the Company, and signed by the vice president and treasurer of Holdings in the case of Holdings, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration
 
Statement, the Final Prospectus, any supplements to the Final Prospectus and this Agreement and that:
     (i) in the case of Holdings, the representations and warranties of Holdings in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date;
     (ii) in the case of the Company, the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
     (iii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and
     (iv) since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto), there has been no material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), prospects, earnings, business or properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth or contemplated in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
     (f) The Company shall have requested and caused Ernst & Young LLP to have furnished to the Representatives, at the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representatives), dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder, and stating in effect, except as provided in Schedule I hereto, that:
     (i) in their opinion the audited financial statements and financial statement schedules included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission;
     (ii) the information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus in response to Regulation S-K, Item 301 (Selected Financial Data) and Item 503(d) (Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges) is in conformity with the applicable disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K; and
 
     (iii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement, the information included or incorporated by reference in Items 1, 2, 6, 7 and 11 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, and the information included in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.
     References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (f) of this Section 6 include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter.
     (g) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (f) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth or contemplated in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto) the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
     (h) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
     (i) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and Holdings shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
     If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled
 
at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
     The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 shall be delivered at the office of Baker Botts L.L.P., counsel for the Company, at One Shell Plaza, 910 Louisiana Street, Houston, Texas 77002, on the Closing Date.
     7. Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses. If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof (other than as a result of the occurrence of the circumstances in Section 10(ii) hereof) or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through Barclays Capital Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
     8. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) Each of the Company and Holdings, jointly and severally, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; that neither the Company nor Holdings will be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company or Holdings may otherwise have.
provided, however,
          (b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and Holdings, each of their respective directors, each of their respective officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls either the Company or Holdings within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company or Holdings to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the
 
documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. Each of the Company and Holdings acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting", (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances, (iii) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids and (iv) the paragraph relating to internet distribution of the Securities in the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the Final Prospectus.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ a separate counsel (including a local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party. An indemnifying party shall not be liable under this Section 8 to any indemnified party regarding any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of
provided, however,
 
which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent is consented to by such indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
          (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, Holdings and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively, "Losses") to which the Company, Holdings and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and Holdings on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company, Holdings and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and Holdings on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company and Holdings shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company and Holdings on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, Holdings and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this paragraph (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company or Holdings within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company or Holdings who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company or Holdings shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company or Holdings, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
provided, however,
 
     9. Default by an Underwriter. If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Notes set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter, the Company or Holdings. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
provided, however,
     10. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission, (ii) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (iii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal, New York State or State of Texas authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or (iv) there shall have occurred any material change in the financial markets or any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, insurrection or armed conflict, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
     11. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company and Holdings or their respective officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Company or Holdings or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
     12. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Representatives, will be mailed, delivered or telefaxed to: (1) Barclays Capital

CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION
     This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
     This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of unsecured debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness of the Company (the "Debt Securities") of the series hereinafter specified, all issued or to be issued under and pursuant to the Indenture, to which Indenture reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Debt Securities.

4. .
Indenture
     This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of Debt Securities of the Company issued and to be issued in one or more series under the Indenture.
     Capitalized terms herein are used as defined in the Indenture unless otherwise defined herein. The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto, those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, as in effect on the date of the Indenture, and those terms stated in the Officers' Certificate to the Trustee, duly authorized by resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company on July 18, 2002 and January 30, 2004 (the "Resolutions"). The Securities are subject to all such terms, and Holders of Securities are referred to the Indenture, all indentures supplemental thereto, said Act and said Resolutions and Officers' Certificate for a statement of them. The Securities of this series are general unsecured obligations of the Company limited with an initial aggregate principal amount of $350,000,000.
5. .
Redemption
     The Securities will be redeemable, at the option of the Company, at any time in whole, or from time to time in part, at a Redemption Price (the "Make-Whole Price") equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed; or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (at the rate in effect on the date of calculation of the Redemption Price) on the Securities (exclusive of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable Treasury Yield plus 15 basis points; plus, in either case, accrued interest to the Redemption Date.
     Securities called for redemption become due on the Redemption Date. Notices of redemption will be mailed at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each holder of record of the Securities to be redeemed at its registered address. The notice of redemption for the Securities will state, among other things, the amount of Securities to be redeemed, the Redemption Date, the Make-Whole Price and the place(s) that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of Securities to be redeemed. Unless the Company
 
defaults in payment of the Make-Whole Price, interest will cease to accrue on any Securities that have been called for redemption at the Redemption Date. If less than all the Securities are redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select the Securities to be redeemed on a pro rata basis or by any other method the Trustee deems fair and appropriate.
     For purposes of determining the Make-Whole Price, the following definitions are applicable:
     "Treasury Yield" means, with respect to any Redemption Date applicable to the Securities, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity (computed as of the third Business Day immediately preceding such Redemption Date) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the applicable Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Securities.
     "Independent Investment Banker" means any of Barclays Capital Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. or J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (and their respective successors), or, if all of such firms are unwilling or unable to select the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee and reasonably acceptable to the Company.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (i) the bid price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) at 4:00 p.m. on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date, as set forth on "Telerate Page 500" (or such other page as may replace Telerate Page 500), or (ii) if such page (or any successor page) is not displayed or does not contain such bid prices at such time (a) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations obtained by the Trustee for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations obtained, or (b) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations obtained by the Trustee.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (i) each of Barclays Capital Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., or their respective successors, unless any of them ceases to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), in which case the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer, and (ii) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Company.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date for the Securities, an average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue for the Securities (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference
 
Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
     Except as set forth above, the Securities will not be redeemable prior to their Stated Maturity and will not be entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund.
     The Securities may be redeemed in part in multiplies of $1,000 only.
     Any such redemption will also comply with Article Eleven of the Indenture.
6. .
Denominations; Transfer; Exchange
     The Securities are issued in registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder may register the transfer of, or exchange, Securities in accordance with the Indenture. The Securities Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture.
7. .
Person Deemed Owners
     The registered Holder of a Security may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
8. .
Amendment; Supplement; Waiver
     Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture may be amended or supplemented, and any existing Event of Default or compliance with any provision may be waived, with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of each series affected. Without consent of any Holder, the parties thereto may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Securities to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, or make any other change that does not adversely affect the interests of any Holder of a Security. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Security and any Securities which may be issued in exchange or substitution herefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Security or such other Securities.
9. .
Defaults and Remedies
     If an Event of Default with respect to the Securities occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding may declare the principal amount of all the Securities to be due and payable immediately in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, however, if at any time after such a declaration of acceleration has been made and before judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as provided in the Indenture, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities, by written notice to the Company and to the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if (1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay (A) all overdue interest on all Securities,
 
(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities which has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate prescribed therefor herein, (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate prescribed therefor herein, and (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and (2) all Events of Default under the Indenture with respect to the Securities, other than the nonpayment of the principal of Securities which has become due solely by such declaration acceleration, shall have been cured or shall have been waived. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or shall impair any right consequent thereon. Holders of Securities may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require indemnity satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the Securities. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power.
10.
Trustee Dealings with Company.
     The Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services for the Company or its Affiliates or any subsidiary of the Company's Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates as if it were not the Trustee.
11.
Authentication.
     This Security shall not be valid until the Trustee or authenticating agent signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Security.

     SECTION 1. Guarantee. (a) The Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Debt Securities (the "Obligations"), according to the terms of the Debt Securities and as more fully described in the Indenture (as amended, modified or otherwise supplemented from time to time, the "Indenture"), dated as of September 10, 1997, between the Issuer, as successor to USA Waste Services, Inc., and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as successor to Texas Commerce Bank National Association and successor to The Chase Manhattan Bank, as trustee (the "Trustee").
          (b) It is the intention of the Guarantor that this Guarantee not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to this Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Obligations of the Guarantor under this Guarantee shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor (other than guarantees of the Guarantor in respect of subordinated debt) that are relevant under such laws, result in the Obligations of the Guarantor under this Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance. For purposes hereof, "Bankruptcy Law" means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar Federal or state law for the relief of debtors.
     SECTION 2. Guarantee Absolute. The Guarantor guarantees that the Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of holders of the Debt Securities with respect thereto. The liability of the Guarantor under this Guarantee shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of:
     (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Indenture or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;
     (ii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from the Indenture;
     (iii) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guaranty, for all or any of the Obligations; or
     (iv) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Issuer or a guarantor.
 
     SECTION 3. Subordination. The Guarantor covenants and agrees that its obligation to make payments of the Obligations hereunder constitutes an unsecured obligation of the Guarantor ranking (a) with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Guarantor and (b) senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Guarantor.
pari passu
     SECTION 4. Waiver; Subrogation (a) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of merger or bankruptcy of the Issuer, any right to require a proceeding filed first against the Issuer, protest or notice with respect to the Debt Securities or the indebtedness evidenced thereby and all demands whatsoever.
          (b) The Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the Trustee or the holders of any Debt Securities against the Issuer in respect of any amounts paid to the Trustee or such holder by the Guarantor pursuant to the provisions of this Guarantee; provided, however, that the Guarantor shall not be entitled to enforce, or to receive any payments arising out of or based upon, such right of subrogation until all Obligations shall have been paid in full.
     SECTION 5. No Waiver, Remedies. No failure on the part of any holder of the Debt Securities to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.
     SECTION 6. Continuing Guarantee; Transfer of Interest. This Guarantee is a continuing guaranty and shall (i) remain in full force and effect until the earliest to occur of (A) the date, if any, on which the Guarantor shall consolidate with or merge into the Issuer or any successor thereto, (B) the date, if any, on which the Issuer or any successor thereto shall consolidate with or merge into the Guarantor, (C) payment in full of the Obligations and (D) the release of the guarantee by the Guarantor by (1) the banks under the Revolving Credit Agreement dated June 29, 2001, by and among the Issuer, the Guarantor (as guarantor), Fleet National Bank, as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A. and J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers, (or under any amendment thereto or any replacement or new principal credit facility of the Issuer) and (2) the banks under the Revolving Credit Agreement dated June 27, 2002, by and among the Issuer, the Guarantor (as guarantor), Fleet National Bank, as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, J.P.

     SECTION 7. Reinstatement. This Guarantee shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by any holder of the Debt Securities or the Trustee upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Issuer or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.
 
     SECTION 8. Amendment. The Guarantor may amend this Guarantee at any time for any purpose without the consent of the Trustee or any holder of the Debt Securities; provided, however, that if such amendment adversely affects the rights of the Trustee or any holder of the Debt Securities, the prior written consent of the Trustee shall be required.
     SECTION 9. Governing Law. THIS GUARANTEE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE PROVISIONS THEREOF RELATING TO CONFLICT OF LAWS.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Guarantor has caused this Guarantee to be duly executed and delivered by its officer thereunto duly authorized as of the date first above written.
