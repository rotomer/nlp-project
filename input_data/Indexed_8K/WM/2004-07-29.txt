Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE: WMI) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2004. Revenues for the quarter were $3.14 billion as compared with $2.93 billion in the year ago period, an increase of 7%. Net income reported for the quarter was $216 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared with net income of $176 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, for the second quarter 2003, an increase of 23%. Results for the second quarter 2003 included a pre-tax restructuring charge of $23 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, related to a workforce reduction completed in 2003.
HOUSTON  July 29, 2004 
"Our encouraging financial results were driven by strong revenue growth, which reflects improved general business conditions as well as the success of our sales and business development initiatives," commented David P. Steiner, Chief Executive Officer. "Higher volumes were the primary factor behind the increase in internal revenue growth and clearly indicate the effects of a growing economy. Our top line results also validate our success in building a more effective sales force and improving our service offering. Our disciplined acquisition program contributed 2.5% higher third-party revenues compared to the same quarter in 2003. As for our costs, we maintained our operating costs on a percentage of revenue basis as compared to the prior year quarter, and we reduced selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue. We lowered SG&A to 10.1%, a 20 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter."
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2004, Waste Management reported operating revenues of $6.03 billion as compared with $5.67 billion for the comparable period last year. Net income was $368 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.63 for the six months ended June 30, 2004 as compared with $237 million and $0.40, respectively, for the same period in 2003. The 2004 results include the favorable impact of the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $8 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. The 2003 results included the unfavorable impact of cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles of $46 million, or $0.08 per diluted share. Net income before cumulative effect increased 27.2% in 2004 as compared to the prior year's first six months. Results from the first six months of 2003 included a pre-tax restructuring charge of $43 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, related to workforce reductions completed in 2003.
The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2004 is related entirely to final implementation of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, . In 2003, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles was primarily related to the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, , partially offset by accounting policy changes related to certain maintenance activities and loss contracts.

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations
The following important highlights for the quarter were reported:
Steiner added, "Our volumes continued the strong trend we first experienced in March of this year. Our most improved areas were in the landfill and roll-off lines of business, both of which are signals of higher economic activity. The strength of July's volumes causes us to remain optimistic about healthy revenue growth in the second half of 2004. We are now expecting full-year revenue to be in a range from $12.2 to $12.3 billion with the increase being driven more by volume than yield. We continue to focus on pricing in all facets of the business, with renewed emphasis at our landfills. We have had success in implementing price increases. Second quarter price increases were muted by changes in business mix and competitive pressures, with the net result being an increase in overall yield of 0.4%. We will continue our disciplined approach to price increases in the collection and disposal areas of our business and work toward increasing the overall yield. Recycling commodity prices were again strong and are expected to remain so through the end of the year."
 
     Steiner continued, "Our ability to return value to our shareholders remained excellent as we generated $238 million in free cash flow(a) for the quarter. Given our strong first half performance, we now expect cash flow from operations for the year to be at the high end of the $2.1 to $2.2 billion range and free cash flow(a) for the year to be at the high end of the $900 million to $1 billion range. We repurchased over $89 million of our common stock in the quarter and still plan to repurchase $400 to $500 million for the year. Our significant free cash flow will also be used to pay our quarterly dividend and to fund our accretive, tuck-in acquisition program.
     "In addition to our prospects for growing revenues and generating cash, we are focused on reducing our operating costs and improving the results of our lower performing business units. We intend to take advantage of the expected continuing growth in volumes by leveraging our fixed costs to expand our operating margins. And, as customers begin to order new and larger containers, revenue growth will accelerate in the commercial segment."
