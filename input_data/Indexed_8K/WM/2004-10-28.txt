Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE: WMI) today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2004. Revenues for the quarter were $3.27 billion as compared with $3.00 billion in the year ago period, an increase of 9%. Net income reported for the quarter was $302 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, compared with net income of $210 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the third quarter 2003, an increase in net income of 44%. This year's third quarter earnings included a $0.12 per diluted share benefit from favorable tax audit settlements.
HOUSTON  October 28, 2004 
"Our third quarter results reflect both improved pricing and continued strong volumes," stated David P. Steiner, Chief Executive Officer of Waste Management. "Internal revenue growth due to higher yield across our base business was 0.8%. This matches the highest level we have seen in over two years and shows the success of our pricing initiatives on the collection side of our business as well as our ability to raise rates at our transfer stations and to increase prices on municipal solid waste streams coming into our landfills. Our revenue growth due to higher volumes reflected the continuation of a strong economy and included increased volumes from the four hurricanes during the quarter. We attribute $59 million of our higher revenues in the quarter to our Florida hurricane clean-up efforts. We estimate that the earnings contribution from the hurricanes was approximately $5 million before-tax. More importantly, our teams in Florida demonstrated their commitment to their communities and solidified the excellent working relationships with their customers in this time of crisis.
Steiner continued, "We were also pleased with our strong cash generation, as we produced $599 million in cash from operations and $305 million in free cash flow for the quarter. That brings our cash generated from operations for the first three quarters to
(a)
 
$1.6 billion and our total free cash flow to $854 million. Based on this, for the full year we expect to meet or exceed our previously stated ranges of $2.1 to $2.2 billion in cash flow from operations and $900 million to $1 billion in free cash flow.
"We increased the level of our common stock share repurchases to $240 million during the quarter and expect to repurchase $425 to $500 million for the year. The Company also announced today that our Board of Directors has approved a new capital allocation program that provides up to $1.2 billion annually in cash dividends and common stock repurchases over the next three years. Under this plan, we expect to increase our quarterly dividend payments to a total of $0.80 per share per year, which would result in an increase of $0.05 per share per year compared to the dividends declared in 2004. The balance of the $1.2 billion authorization would be available for share repurchases. This program reinforces our commitment to returning value to our shareholders and our confidence in our ability to generate strong and consistent free cash flows."
For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, Waste Management reported operating revenues of $9.31 billion as compared with $8.66 billion for the comparable period last year. Net income was $670 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.15 for the current year nine-month period, as compared with $447 million and $0.75, respectively, for the same period in 2003. The 2004 results include the favorable impact of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $8 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. The 2003 results included the unfavorable impact of cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles of $46 million, or $0.08 per diluted share. Net income before cumulative effect increased 34% in 2004 as compared to the prior year's first nine months. Results from the first nine months of 2003 included a pre-tax restructuring charge of $43 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, related to workforce reductions completed in 2003.
The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2004 is related entirely to final implementation of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, . In 2003, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles was primarily related to the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, , partially offset by accounting policy changes related to certain maintenance activities and loss contracts.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations
Steiner added, "Our operating costs as a percentage of revenue increased by 90 basis points as compared with the prior year quarter. This increase was attributable largely to the one-time impact of our hurricane clean-up efforts and higher fuel costs. Including the fuel surcharges we paid to sub-contractors in the quarter, higher fuel prices cost us about $10 million of operating income, or $0.01 per diluted share, as compared to last year's quarter. As a company we remain keenly focused on raising our prices to cover all cost increases and reducing those costs within our control."
During the third quarter of this year, Waste Management settled federal income tax audits for several subsidiaries, which increased earnings by $71 million, or $0.12 per diluted share. The Company has been actively negotiating tax audit settlements involving tax returns dating as far back as 1988. The Company has made significant progress in settling open tax audits and expects to close the remaining open federal income tax audits over the next few quarters.
 
The following important highlights for the quarter were reported:
 The Company included its free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, herein because it believes that investors are interested in the cash produced by the Company from non-financing activities that is available for uses such as the Company's acquisition program, its share repurchase program, its scheduled debt reduction and the payment of dividends. The Company defines free cash flow as:
(a)
The Company's definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. The Company has reconciled its free cash flow as presented herein to cash flow from operations, which is the most comparable GAAP measure, in the accompanying schedules.

The information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the information on the conference call.

WMI #04-25
Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE: WMI) today announced that its Board of Directors approved a new capital allocation program, designed to benefit shareholders, that includes the authorization for up to $1.2 billion annually in cash dividends and common stock repurchases for each of the next three years. Beginning in the first quarter of 2005, the Company expects to increase its quarterly dividends to a total of $0.80 per share per year, which would be an increase of $0.05 per share per year compared to the dividends declared in 2004. Future quarterly dividends must first be declared by its Board of Directors prior to payment.
HOUSTON  October 28, 2004 
As part of the new capital allocation program, the Board of Directors has authorized management to continue to make stock repurchases each year over the next three years in an amount not to exceed the $1.2 billion annually, less dividends paid. Based on the number of outstanding shares as of September 30, 2004, the Company expects to pay approximately $460 million in dividends on an annual basis. The amount of stock repurchased will also depend on a number of items, including capital expenditures and cash acquisition costs, two other key components of the capital allocation program.
 
"This announcement reinforces our commitment to return free cash flow to our shareholders," said David P. Steiner, Chief Executive Officer of Waste Management, Inc. "Waste Management continues to demonstrate its ability to generate consistent and strong cash flows from its operations and the Board of Directors and management continue to believe that a capital allocation program that benefits our shareholders is one of our most important mandates.
"Beginning in the first quarter of 2005, we expect to increase our quarterly dividend payment from the $0.1875 per share we paid in 2004 to $0.20 per share. At the current share price of approximately $27, this equates to an annual yield of nearly 3%. This dividend yield would continue to place Waste Management in the top 20% for dividend yield of the Standard and Poor's 500 Index of companies," Steiner said.
"The authorization for new share repurchases replaces our current three-year program, under which we have already bought back over 72 million shares, which represents 12% of the number of shares outstanding at the end of 2001."
