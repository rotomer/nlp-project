Item 8.01 Other Items
     On November 2, 2004, Waste Management, Inc. (the "Company") issued 7,474 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), to certain class members in the class action lawsuit filed against it relating to its earnings announcements in July and August 1999. The settlement agreement, announced in November 2001, provided for the issuance to certain class members of shares of common stock in lieu of the cash they would otherwise have received as participants in the class. The shares issued equal the amount of cash these class members would have otherwise received under the settlement agreement, divided by a thirty day trailing average of the closing price of the Company's Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange.
     The Company has filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to the Company's registration statement on Form S3, File No. 33397697 (the "Registration Statement"). Attached as an Exhibit to this Form 8K is a legal opinion relating to the issuance of the 7,474 shares to be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement.
