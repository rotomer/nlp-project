Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On January 27, 2005, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Waste Management, Inc. (the "Company") granted performance share units awards ("PSUs") pursuant to the Company's 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan") to each of David P. Steiner, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Lawrence O'Donnell, III, President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company. The grants are parts of awards granted to the executives in June 2004 in connection with their promotions to their current positions; in June 2004, the Committee decided to award each of the executives PSUs, 1/3 of the total number to be granted at that time and the remaining 2/3 of the award to be granted in 2005, after the Committee had adopted a return on capital based metric for performance awards and subject to each of the executives meeting certain stock purchase requirements. In June 2004, the Committee granted Mr. Steiner 16,667 PSUs and Mr. O'Donnell 10,000 PSUs. Those awards require the achievement of earnings per share and return on capital employed based performance targets, measurable as of December 31, 2004, and the actual number of shares to be issued pursuant to those awards, which ranges from 0  150% of the targeted amounts, will be determined after the completion of the audit of the Company's 2004 year end financial statements and the Committee's certification of actual level of achievement. As reported on a Form 8-K dated December 16, 2004, the Committee approved the types of awards to be granted in 2005 under the Plan, as well as a return on capital based metric for those awards. Messrs. Steiner and O'Donnell have each met their stock purchase requirements under the original awards. Therefore, on January 27, 2005, the Committee approved the remaining 2/3 of the promotional awards granted to Messrs. Steiner and O'Donnell, in the target amounts of 33,333 and 20,000 PSUs, respectively. The actual number of PSUs earned will depend on certain performance measures being achieved, as described below.
     The material terms of the promotional PSUs granted to Messrs. Steiner and O'Donnell on January 27 are as follows:

At the Committee's meeting on January 27, 2005, it approved the grant of RSUs and PSUs to selected participants, and at that time finalized the terms and conditions of those awards. The material terms of the awards granted on January 27, 2005 to selected participants (including Messrs. Steiner and O'Donnell, as well as other members of senior management), are as follows:
