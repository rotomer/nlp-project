WMI #05-07
Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE: WMI) today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2004. Revenues for the quarter were $3.21 billion compared with $2.99 billion in the year ago period, an increase of 7.4%. Net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle reported for the quarter was $269 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, compared with $226 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2003, an increase of 19%.
HOUSTON  February 10, 2005 
"Our financial results for the year were driven by strong revenue growth due to higher volumes and escalating yield growth during the last half of the year," stated David P. Steiner, Chief Executive Officer of Waste Management. "During the fourth quarter of this year, higher base business yield contributed 1.2% to internal revenue growth, which is the highest growth from yield we have seen since the fourth quarter of 2001. This indicates that our multi-faceted pricing initiatives are gaining traction. Fourth quarter revenues also benefited from continued clean-up efforts in Florida related to the third quarter hurricanes. These contributed $56 million in revenues during the quarter and produced approximately $7 million in before tax earnings.
"In addition, we generated $2.2 billion in net cash provided by operating activities and over $1.05 billion in free cash flow during 2004, of which over $900 million was returned to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Our selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of revenues fell to 10.1% for the full year, which was near the lower end of our stated range for the year and a 30 basis point improvement from 2003."
(a)
This year's fourth quarter earnings included benefits from favorable tax audit settlements of $0.08 per diluted share. Last year's quarter included $17 million of pre-tax income related to a
 
litigation settlement, which improved fourth quarter 2003 earnings by approximately $0.02 per diluted share.
Net income reported for the 2003 quarter was $183 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, after considering a $43 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, unfavorable cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the application of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, ("FIN 46").
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
For the full year 2004, Waste Management reported operating revenues of $12.52 billion, compared with $11.65 billion in 2003, an increase of 7.5%. Net income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the year was $931 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, compared with $719 million and $1.21 for the year 2003, an increase of $212 million, or 29%.
Full year net income after considering cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles was $939 million, or $1.61 per diluted share, for 2004 and $630 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, for 2003. The favorable cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2004 of $8 million is related entirely to the final implementation of FIN 46. In 2003 the unfavorable cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles of $89 million was primarily related to the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, and the implementation of FIN 46. These unfavorable changes in 2003 were partially offset by accounting policy changes related to certain maintenance activities at our waste-to-energy and independent power production facilities and to loss contracts.
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,
Steiner continued, "While we were very pleased with our revenue growth and cash flow performance, we continued to experience a few specific cost pressures, which caused fourth quarter operating costs as a percentage of revenue to increase as compared with the prior year quarter. The primary drivers of the operating cost increase were higher fuel costs, higher recycling rebates related to increased recycling commodity prices, and continued hurricane clean-up efforts, for which we relied upon subcontractors to perform a relatively high percentage of the work."
Key Highlights for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year
 
Steiner added, "As we enter 2005, we are optimistic that our drive to recover our increasing costs by raising prices across all lines of business, along with a solid economy, will continue the momentum in yield improvement and revenue growth that we saw in 2004. We plan to tackle the cost challenges that are facing us through our commitment to operational excellence, higher productivity and improved efficiencies. Our goal is to reduce, as a percentage of revenue, both our operating and selling, general and administrative costs during 2005, leading to improved margins in 2005. As a result of recent changes in our annual and long term incentive plans, our management team is now keenly focused on expanding our margins, generating cash that can be returned to our shareholders and improving our returns on invested capital."
2005 Outlook
The Company also announced the following in regard to its financial outlook for 2005:
 
The Company included its free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, herein because it believes that investors are interested in the cash produced by the Company from non-financing activities that is available for uses such as the Company's acquisition program, its share repurchase program, its scheduled debt reduction and the payment of dividends. The Company defines free cash flow as:
(a)
