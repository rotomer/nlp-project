Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On August 26, 2005, Waste Management, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a new employment agreement with Cherie C. Rice, Vice President  Finance and Treasurer, effective as of March 7, 2005. The Company announced in March 2005 that Ms. Rice, who has served as Vice President  Finance and Treasurer since January 2004, has been elevated to the Company's Senior Leadership Team. Ms. Rice previously served as Vice President  Investor Relations for over six years and has approximately 20 years of service with the Company or one of its predecessors.
     The agreement is for a term of two years, and automatically renews for successive one-year periods thereafter. During the employment period, Ms. Rice shall be paid a minimum base salary of $262,000 per year and shall be entitled to a bonus in accordance with the Company's incentive compensation plan. Ms. Rice shall have a target annual bonus of 50% of her base salary, although her actual bonus may range from 0  100% of her base salary, depending on the achievement of certain personal and corporate performance goals. Additionally, Ms. Rice shall be entitled to certain perquisites, including an annual automobile allowance, financial planning services, social organization initiation fees and dues and an annual physical examination. Ms. Rice shall also be entitled to participate in or receive benefits under any and all plans and programs made available to executive employees of the Company generally.
     In the event of the termination of Ms. Rice's employment by the Company, she will be entitled to certain severance payments. Specifically, if Ms. Rice is terminated without cause or she leaves the Company for good reason, in addition to the benefits all employees receive, including all amounts accrued but unpaid at the date of termination and payments under applicable Company plans, policies and arrangements, Ms. Rice generally is entitled to a payment equal to one times her base salary, of which one-half shall be paid in a lump sum within ten (10) days after such termination and one-half shall be paid during the one (1) year period beginning on the date of termination and shall be paid at the same time and in the same manner as base salary would have been paid if Ms. Rice had remained employed by the Company, and continuation of all health and welfare plan benefits for her and her family for the lesser of one year, her death or until she becomes covered by a subsequent employer. In the event Ms. Rice is terminated without cause or leaves the Company for good reason, in connection with a change in control, she generally is entitled to the same benefits that she would receive as described for a termination without cause or by Ms. Rice for good reason, except the amount of the payment would be made in a lump sum. In the event Ms. Rice's employment is terminated by reason of death or total disability, she generally will receive all amounts accrued but unpaid at the date of termination, a pro rated bonus payment and any benefits to which she is entitled pursuant to the plans, policies and arrangements of the Company in accordance with their terms.
     Ms. Rice's agreement also contains certain restrictive covenants, including covenants not to compete or solicit Company customers or employees for a period of two years after the termination of her employment, and a covenant not to disparage the Company.
     The terms "cause," "good reason," and "total disability" are all defined in Ms. Rice's employment agreement.

4. Compensation and Benefits.
     During the Employment Period, the Company shall pay Executive a base salary at the annual rate of Two Hundred Sixty Two Thousand Dollars ($262,000.00) per year, or such higher rate as may be determined from time to time by the Company ("Base Salary").

Executive's receipt of disability benefits under the Company's long-term disability plan or receipt of Social Security disability benefits shall be deemed conclusive evidence of Total Disability for purpose of this Agreement; provided, however, that in the absence of Executive's receipt of such long-term disability benefits or Social Security benefits, the Company's Board may, in their reasonable discretion (but based upon appropriate medical evidence), determine that Executive is Totally Disabled.
(b) Total Disability.

(c) there is a consummated merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than (1) a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving or parent entity) more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the Company or such surviving or parent entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation or (2) a merger or consolidation effected to implement a recapitalization of the Company (or similar transaction) in which no Person, directly or indirectly, acquired twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities; or

9. No Mitigation; No Set-Off.
     
10. Covenants
     . All written materials, records, data, and other documents prepared or possessed by Executive during Executive's employment with the Company are the Company's property. All information, ideas, concepts, improvements, discoveries, and inventions that are conceived, made, developed, or acquired by Executive individually or in conjunction with others during Executive's employment (whether during business hours and whether on the Company's premises or otherwise) which relate to the Company's business, products, or services are the Company's sole and exclusive property. All memoranda, notes, records, files, correspondence, drawings, manuals, models, specifications, computer programs, maps, and all other documents, data, or materials of any type embodying such information, ideas, concepts, improvements, discoveries, and inventions are the Company's property. At the termination of Executive's employment with the Company for any reason, Executive shall return all of the Company's documents, data, or other Company property to the Company.
(a) Company Property
 
     . Executive acknowledges that the business of the Company is highly competitive and that the Company has provided and will continue to provide Executive with access to "Confidential Information" relating to the business of the Company and its affiliates.
(b) Confidential Information; Non-Disclosure
     For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" means and includes the Company's confidential and/or proprietary information and/or trade secrets that have been developed or used and/or will be developed and that cannot be obtained readily by third parties from outside sources. Confidential Information includes, by way of example and without limitation, the following information regarding customers, employees, contractors, and the industry not generally known to the public; strategies, methods, books, records, and documents; technical information concerning products, equipment, services, and processes; procurement procedures and pricing techniques; the names of and other information concerning customers, investors, and business affiliates (such as contact name, service provided, pricing for that customer, type and amount of services used, credit and financial data, and/or other information relating to the Company's relationship with that customer); pricing strategies and price curves; positions, plans, and strategies for expansion or acquisitions; budgets; customer lists; research; weather data; financial and sales data; trading methodologies and terms; evaluations, opinions, and interpretations of information and data; marketing and merchandising techniques; prospective customers' names and marks; grids and maps; electronic databases; models; specifications; computer programs; internal business records; contracts benefiting or obligating the Company; bids or proposals submitted to any third party; technologies and methods; training methods and training processes; organizational structure; personnel information, including salaries of personnel; payment amounts or rates paid to consultants or other service providers; and other such confidential or proprietary information. Information need not qualify as a trade secret to be protected as Confidential Information under this Agreement, and the authorized and controlled disclosure of Confidential Information to authorized parties by Company in the pursuit of its business will not cause the information to lose its protected status under this Agreement. Executive acknowledges that this Confidential Information constitutes a valuable, special, and unique asset used by the Company or its affiliates in their businesses to obtain a competitive advantage over their competitors. Executive further acknowledges that protection of such Confidential Information against unauthorized disclosure and use is of critical importance to the Company and its affiliates in maintaining their competitive position.
     Executive has and will continue to have access to, or knowledge of, Confidential Information of third parties, such as actual and potential customers, suppliers, partners, joint venturers, investors, financing sources, and the like, of the Company and its affiliates.
     The Company also agrees to provide Executive with one or more of the following: access to Confidential Information; specialized training regarding the Company's methodologies and business strategies, and/or support in the development of goodwill such as introductions, information and reimbursement of customer development expenses consistent with Company policy. The foregoing is not contingent on continued employment, but is contingent upon Executive's use of the Confidential Information access, specialized training, and goodwill support provided by Company for the exclusive benefit of the Company and upon Executive's full compliance with the restrictions on Executive's conduct provided for in this Agreement.
 
     In addition to the requirements set forth in Section 5(c)(i), Executive agrees that Executive will not after Executive's employment with the Company, make any unauthorized disclosure of any then Confidential Information or specialized training of the Company or its affiliates, or make any use thereof, except in the carrying out of her employment responsibilities hereunder. Executive also agrees to preserve and protect the confidentiality of third party Confidential Information to the same extent, and on the same basis, as the Company's Confidential Information.
     . The Company agrees to and shall provide Executive with immediate access to Confidential Information. Ancillary to the rights provided to Executive following employment termination, the Company's provision of Confidential Information, specialized training, and/or goodwill support to Executive, and Executive's agreements, regarding the use of same, and in order to protect the value of any equity based incentive awards (including, without limitation, stock options, restricted stock, restricted share units or performance share units), training, goodwill support and/or the Confidential Information described above, the Company and Executive agree to the following provisions against unfair competition. Executive agrees that for a period of two (2) years following the termination of employment for any reason ("Restricted Term"), Executive will not, directly or indirectly, for Executive or for others, anywhere in the United States (including all parishes in Louisiana, and Puerto Rico) (the "Restricted Area") do the following, unless expressly authorized to do so in writing by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company:
(c) Unfair Competition Restrictions
Engage in, or assist any person, entity, or business engaged in, the selling or providing of products or services that would displace the products or services that (i) the Company is currently in the business of providing and was in the business of providing, or was planning to be in the business of providing, at the time Executive was employed with the Company, and (ii) that Executive had involvement in or received Confidential Information about in the course of employment; the foregoing is expressly understood to include, without limitation, the business of the collection, transfer, recycling and resource recovery, or disposal of solid waste, hazardous or other waste, including the operation of waste-to-energy facilities.
     It is further agreed that during the Restricted Term, Executive cannot engage in any of the enumerated prohibited activities in the Restricted Area by means of telephone, telecommunications, satellite communications, correspondence, or other contact from outside the Restricted Area. Executive further understands that the foregoing restrictions may limit her ability to engage in certain businesses during the Restricted Term, but acknowledges that these restrictions are necessary to protect the Confidential Information the Company has provided to Executive.
     A failure to comply with the foregoing restrictions will create a presumption that Executive is engaging in unfair competition. Executive agrees that this Section defining unfair competition with the Company does not prevent Executive from using and offering the skills that Executive possessed prior to receiving access to Confidential Information, confidential training,
 
and knowledge from the Company. This Agreement creates an advance approval process, and nothing herein is intended, or will be construed as, a general restriction against the pursuit of lawful employment in violation of any controlling state or federal laws. Executive shall be permitted to engage in activities that would otherwise be prohibited by this covenant if such activities are determined in the sole discretion of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company to be no material threat to the legitimate business interests of the Company.
     . For a period of two (2) years following the termination of employment for any reason, Executive will not call on, service, or solicit competing business from customers of the Company or its affiliates whom Executive, within the previous twelve (12) months, (i) had or made contact with, or (ii) had access to information and files about, or induce or encourage any such customer or other source of ongoing business to stop doing business with Company.
(d) Non-Solicitation of Customers
     . During Executive's employment, and for a period of two (2) years following the termination of employment for any reason, Executive will not, either directly or indirectly, call on, solicit, encourage, or induce any other employee or officer of the Company or its affiliates whom Executive had contact with, knowledge of, or association within the course of employment with the Company to terminate her employment, and will not assist any other person or entity in such a solicitation.
(e) Non-Solicitation of Employees
     Executive covenants and agrees that Executive shall not engage in any pattern of conduct that involves the making or publishing of written or oral statements or remarks (including, without limitation, the repetition or distribution of derogatory rumors, allegations, negative reports or comments) which are disparaging, deleterious or damaging to the integrity, reputation or good will of the Company, its management, or of management of corporations affiliated with the Company.
(f) Non-Disparagement.
     
11. Enforcement of Covenants.
     Executive agrees that any breach by Executive of any of the covenants set forth in Section 10 hereof during Executive's employment by the Company, shall be grounds for immediate dismissal of Executive for Cause pursuant to Section 5(c)(i), which shall be in addition to and not exclusive of any and all other rights and remedies the Company may have against Executive.
(a) Termination of Employment and Forfeiture of Compensation.
     . Executive acknowledges that a breach of the covenants set forth in Section 10 hereof will cause irreparable damage to the Company with respect to which the Company's remedy at law for damages will be inadequate. Therefore, in the event of breach or anticipatory breach of the covenants set forth in this section by Executive, Executive and the Company agree that the Company shall be entitled to seek the following particular forms of relief, in addition to remedies otherwise available to it at law or equity: (A) injunctions, both preliminary and permanent, enjoining or restraining such breach or anticipatory breach and Executive hereby consents to the issuance thereof forthwith and without bond by any court of competent jurisdiction; and (B) recovery of all reasonable sums as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction expended and costs, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by the Company to enforce the covenants set forth in this section.
(b) Right to Injunction
 
     The covenants contained in Section 10 hereof constitute a series of separate but ancillary covenants, one for each applicable State in the United States and the District of Columbia, and one for each applicable foreign country. If in any judicial proceeding, a court shall hold that any of the covenants set forth in Section 10 exceed the time, geographic, or occupational limitations permitted by applicable laws, Executive and the Company agree that such provisions shall and are hereby reformed to the maximum time, geographic, or occupational limitations permitted by such laws. Further, in the event a court shall hold unenforceable any of the separate covenants deemed included herein, then such unenforceable covenant or covenants shall be deemed eliminated from the provisions of this Agreement for the purpose of such proceeding to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants to be enforced in such proceeding. Executive and the Company further agree that the covenants in Section 10 shall each be construed as a separate agreement independent of any other provisions of this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action by Executive against the Company whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of any of the covenants of Section 10.
(c) Separability of Covenants.
     
12. Indemnification.
     The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Executive to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law for any action or inaction of Executive while serving as an officer and director of the Company or, at the Company's request, as an officer or director of any other entity or as a fiduciary of any benefit plan. This provision includes the obligation and undertaking of the Executive to reimburse the Company for any fees advanced by the Company on behalf of the Executive should it later be determined that Executive was not entitled to have such fees advanced by the Company under Delaware law. The Company shall cover the Executive under directors and officers liability insurance both during and, while potential liability exists, after the Employment Period in the same amount and to the same extent as the Company covers its other officers and directors.
     
13. Arbitration.
     Except with respect to enforcement of the covenants contained in Section 11 herein, the parties agree that any dispute relating to this Agreement, or to the breach of this Agreement, arising between Executive and the Company shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act and the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), or any other mutually agreed upon arbitration service. The arbitration proceeding, including the rendering of an award, shall take place in Houston, Texas, and shall be administered by the AAA (or any other mutually agreed upon arbitration service). The arbitrator shall be jointly selected by the Company and Executive within thirty (30) days of the notice of dispute, or if the parties cannot agree, in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the AAA (or any other mutually agreed upon arbitration service). All fees and expenses associated with the arbitration shall be borne equally by Executive and the Company during the arbitration, pending final decision by the arbitrator as to who should bear fees, unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall not be authorized to create a cause of action or remedy not recognized by applicable state or federal law. The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties without appeal or review, except as permitted by the arbitration laws of
 
the State of Texas. The award shall be enforceable through a court of law upon motion of either party.
     
14. Disputes and Payment of Attorney's Fees.
     If at any time during the term of this Agreement or afterwards there should arise any dispute as to the validity, interpretation or application of any term or condition of this Agreement, the Company agrees, upon written demand by Executive (and Executive shall be entitled upon application to any court of competent jurisdiction, to the entry of a mandatory injunction, without the necessity of posting any bond with respect thereto, compelling the Company) to promptly provide sums sufficient to pay on a current basis (either directly or by reimbursing Executive) Executive's costs and reasonable attorney's fees (including expenses of investigation and disbursements for the fees and expenses of experts, etc.) incurred by Executive in connection with any such dispute or any litigation, provided that Executive shall repay any such amounts paid or advanced if Executive is not the prevailing party with respect to at least one material claim or issue in such dispute or litigation. The provisions of this Section 11, without implication as to any other section hereof, shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement and of Executive's employment hereunder.
     
15. Requirement of Timely Payments.
     If any amounts which are required, or determined to be paid or payable, or reimbursed or reimbursable, to Executive under this Agreement (or any other plan, agreement, policy or arrangement with the Company) are not so paid promptly at the times provided herein or therein, such amounts shall accrue interest, compounded daily, at an 8% annual percentage rate, from the date such amounts were required or determined to have been paid or payable, reimbursed or reimbursable to Executive, until such amounts and any interest accrued thereon are finally and fully paid, provided, however, that in no event shall the amount of interest contracted for, charged or received hereunder, exceed the maximum non-usurious amount of interest allowed by applicable law.
     
16. Withholding of Taxes.
     The Company may withhold from any compensation and benefits payable under this Agreement all applicable federal, state, local, or other taxes.
     
17. Source of Payments.
     All payments provided under this Agreement, other than payments made pursuant to a plan which provides otherwise, shall be paid from the general funds of the Company, and no special or separate fund shall be established, and no other segregation of assets made, to assure payment. Executive shall have no right, title or interest whatever in or to any investments which the Company may make to aid the Company in meeting its obligations hereunder. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company hereunder, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured creditor of the Company.
 
     
18. Assignment.
     Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs, representatives, successors and assigns. This Agreement shall not be assignable by Executive (but any payments due hereunder which would be payable at a time after Executive's death shall be paid to Executive's designated beneficiary or, if none, her estate) and shall be assignable by the Company only to any financially solvent corporation or other entity resulting from the reorganization, merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation or entity or any corporation or entity to or with which the Company's business or substantially all of its business or assets may be sold, exchanged or transferred, and it must be so assigned by the Company to, and accepted as binding upon it by, such other corporation or entity in connection with any such reorganization, merger, consolidation, sale, exchange or transfer in a writing delivered to Executive in a form reasonably acceptable to Executive (the provisions of this sentence also being applicable to any successive such transaction).
     
19. Entire Agreement; Amendment.
     This Agreement shall supersede any and all existing oral or written agreements, representations, or warranties between Executive and the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated entities relating to the terms of Executive's employment by the Company. It may not be amended except by a written agreement signed by both parties.
