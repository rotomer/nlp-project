WMI #06-02
Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE: WMI) today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2005. Revenues for the quarter were $3.37 billion compared with $3.21 billion in the year ago period, an increase of 5.1%. Net income for the quarter was $290 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, compared with $269 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2004, or a 7.8% increase in net income and a 10.6% increase in earnings per share.
HOUSTON  February 14, 2006 
"We are very pleased with our fourth quarter results and the improvement we achieved during the year. In the fourth quarter, we again accomplished our primary objectives of earnings growth, margin expansion and strong free cash flow," stated David P. Steiner, Chief Executive Officer of Waste Management. "Our pricing excellence initiative was the primary contributor to our improved financial performance, as our internal revenue growth from yield on base business increased 3.9% in the fourth quarter of this year over the prior year's quarter. The internal revenue growth due to yield grew 5.5% when you include the impact of our fuel surcharge program.
"We generated $665 million in net cash from operating activities and $286 million of free cash flow during the quarter. For the year, we produced nearly $2.4 billion in net cash from operating activities and over $1.4 billion of free cash flow. Our free cash flow exceeded our full-year objective due to very strong operating cash flow as well as lower than projected capital expenditures and higher than expected divestiture proceeds. We returned $1.16 billion in cash to our shareholders during 2005, which was comprised of cash dividend payments of $449 million and share repurchases of $706 million."
(a)
The Company noted several items that impacted the results for the current quarter:
 
Combined, these items increased fourth quarter 2005 earnings by $35 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. Without the impact of these items, net income for the quarter would have been $255 million, or $0.46 per diluted share.
(a)
The prior year's fourth quarter earnings included $46 million in benefits from favorable tax audit settlements and an after-tax charge of $4 million related to asset impairments and unusual items. Combined, these items increased 2004 fourth quarter earnings by $42 million, or $0.08 per diluted share. Without the impact of these items, net income for the 2004 quarter would have been $227 million, or $0.39 per diluted share.
(a)
Excluding the impact of these items in the current and prior year quarters, adjusted earnings per share grew 17.9% and income from operations as a percent of revenue grew by approximately 90 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared with the same period of 2004.
(a)
Steiner continued, "The strong earnings we produced during the fourth quarter demonstrate the progress we have made in our pricing excellence and operational improvement programs. In addition, several other factors contributed to the positive results during the fourth quarter of 2005. Hurricane related services contributed over $50 million in revenue and approximately $0.01 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. We also recorded about $0.02 per diluted share in net benefits due primarily to adjustments related to landfill capping obligations as a result of our annual FAS 143 accounting review."
The Company also updated its plan to divest under-performing or non-strategic operations. In the third quarter of 2005, the Company identified operations for possible divestiture that represent over $400 million in annual gross revenue. The Company has since identified additional operations, representing over $500 million in annual gross revenue, that may be sold as part of the divestiture program. The Company is not projecting the expected proceeds or the timing of the sales of these operations.
Key Highlights for the Quarter and the Full Year
 
Steiner continued, "We are very proud of our accomplishments during 2005. As we enter 2006, we are optimistic that the momentum we have achieved in our pricing excellence programs will continue. Cost control is also a primary objective and we have specific plans in place to reduce further our operating costs as a percent of revenue. At the same time, in 2006 we will be making investments in our new revenue management system, in landfill gas projects to produce alternative energy, in medical waste projects and in several process improvement initiatives. These investments, along with our divestiture program to sell underperforming or non-strategic businesses, are being undertaken with the objective of improving the strength of the Company in 2006 and beyond.
"We plan to make these important investments while still fulfilling our $1.2 billion capital allocation program for the benefit of shareholders. And even with the higher expense levels associated with these investments, we are confident that we can achieve the analysts' current full-year 2006 earnings consensus of $1.65 per diluted share. In 2006, we will remain committed to our financial goals of expanding our operating margins, increasing our return on invested capital and generating strong free cash flow, which we intend to return to our shareholders in the form of cash dividend payments and share repurchases."
