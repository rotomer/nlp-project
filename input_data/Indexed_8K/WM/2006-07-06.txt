Exhibit 3.2
          SECTION 1.1. . The registered office of the Corporation required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware to be maintained in the State of Delaware shall be the registered office named in the original Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, or such other office as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors in the manner provided by law. Should the Corporation maintain a principal office or place of business within the State of Delaware, such registered office need not be identical to such principal office or place of business of the Corporation.
Registered Office
          SECTION 1.2. . The Corporation may also have offices at such other places both within and without the State of Delaware as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine or the business of the Corporation may require.
Other Offices
          SECTION 2.1. . All meetings of the stockholders shall be held at the principal office of the Corporation, or at such other place, if any, either within or without the State of Delaware and at such date and time as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice or waivers of notice of the meeting.
Meetings
          SECTION 2.2. . The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order for each class of stock, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, at least 10 days prior to the meeting (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of meeting or (ii)
List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote
 
during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the Corporation. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. Except as otherwise provided by law, the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the list of stockholders required by this Section 2.2 or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.
          SECTION 2.3. . If required by applicable law, an annual meeting of stockholders shall be held for the election of directors at such date, time and place, if any, either within or without the State of Delaware, as may be designated by resolution of the Board of Directors from time to time. Any other proper business may be transacted at the annual meeting.
Annual Meetings
          SECTION 2.4. . Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, may be called by the Chairman of the Board (if any), the Chief Executive Officer, or by written order of a majority of the Board of Directors, but such special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice.
Special Meeting
          SECTION 2.5. . Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, notice of the meeting stating the place, if any, date and time of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given. Unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these by-laws, the notice of any meeting shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat. Such notice may be delivered either personally or by mail. If mailed, notice is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. Without limiting the foregoing, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Corporation and shall also be deemed revoked if (1) the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent and (2) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, the transfer agent or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, the failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given by a form of electronic transmission in accordance with these by-laws shall be deemed given: (i) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (iii) if by a posting on an electronic network, together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of such posting and the giving of such separate notice; and (iv) if by another form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. For purposes of these by-laws, "electronic transmission" means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved
Notice of Meeting
 
and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient.
          Without limiting the foregoing, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation may be given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at such address to whom such notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholders by written notice to the Corporation. Any stockholder who fails to object in writing to the Corporation within 60 days of having been given written notice by the Corporation of its intention to send the single notice as set forth in this Section 2.5 shall be deemed to have consented to receiving such single written notice.
          SECTION 2.6. . The holders of a majority in voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at such meeting for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation. The stockholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.
Quorum; Adjournment
          Notwithstanding the other provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or these by-laws, the chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, although not constituting a quorum, shall have power to adjourn, postpone, or recess the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting of the time and place of the adjourned, postponed, or recessed meeting. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
          SECTION 2.7. . When a quorum is present at any meeting of the stockholders, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power, present in person or represented by proxy, shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of the statutes, of the Certificate of Incorporation, or of these bylaws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question. Where a separate vote by class is required, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of such class present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class. Every stockholder having the right to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to a corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be entitled to vote in person, or by proxy appointed by an instrument in writing subscribed by such stockholder, bearing a date not more than three years prior to voting, unless such instrument provides for a longer period, and filed with the Secretary of the Corporation, or such other officer as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine by resolution, before, or at the time of, the meeting.
Voting
 
          Each proxy shall be revocable unless expressly provided therein to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. If such instrument shall designate two or more persons to act as proxies, unless such instrument shall provide the contrary, a majority of such persons present at any meeting at which their powers thereunder are to be exercised shall have and may exercise all the powers of voting or giving consents thereby conferred, or if only one be present, then such powers may be exercised by that one, or, if an even number attend and a majority do not agree on any particular issue, each proxy so attending shall be entitled to exercise such powers in respect of the same portion of the shares as he is of the proxies representing such shares.
          SECTION 2.8. . Shares held in the name of another entity, domestic or foreign, may be voted by such officer, agent, authorized person or proxy as the organizational documents of such entity may prescribe, or in the absence of such provision, as the board of directors or other governing body of such entity may determine. Shares held in the name of a deceased person may be voted by the executor or administrator of such deceased person, either in person or by proxy. Shares held in the name of a guardian, conservator or trustee may be voted by such fiduciary, either in person or by proxy, but no fiduciary shall be entitled to vote shares held in such fiduciary capacity without a transfer of such shares into the name of such fiduciary. Shares held in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver. A stockholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such shares, unless in the transfer by the pledgor on the books of the Corporation, he has expressly empowered the pledgee to vote such shares, in which case only the pledgee, or his proxy, may represent the stock and vote such shares.
Voting of Stock of Certain Holders; Elections; Inspectors
          If shares (or other securities having voting power) are held of record in the names of two or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants by the entirety or otherwise, or if two or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the Secretary of the Corporation is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided, their acts with respect to voting shall have the following effect:
     (a) If only one votes, his act binds all;
     (b) If more than one vote, the act of the majority so voting binds all; or
     (c) If more than one vote, but the vote is evenly split on any particular matter, each fraction may vote the securities in question proportionally, or any person voting the shares, or a beneficiary, if any, may apply to the Delaware Court of Chancery or such other court as may have jurisdiction to appoint an additional person to act with the persons so voting the shares, which shall then be voted as determined by a majority of such persons and the person appointed by such court. If the instrument so filed shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal interests, a majority or even-split for the purpose of this subsection shall be a majority or even-split in interest.
          All voting of stockholders shall be taken by written ballots, each of which shall state the name of the stockholder or proxy voting and such other information as may be required
 
under the procedure established for the meeting. All proxies submitted to management may be voted by a master ballot.
          Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, cumulative voting for the election of directors shall be prohibited.
          SECTION 2.9. . The Corporation may, and shall if required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. In the event that no inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his ability. The inspector or inspectors so appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share, (ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v) certify their determination of the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and such inspectors' count of all votes and ballots. Such certification and report shall specify such other information as may be required by law. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law. No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election.
Inspector of Elections
          SECTION 2.10. . The meetings of the stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board (if any), or if he is not present, by the Vice Chairman of the Board (if any, but if there is more than one, the Vice Chairman who is senior in terms of time as such), or if neither the Chairman of the Board (if any) nor the Vice Chairman of the Board (if any) is present, by the Chief Executive Officer, or if neither the Chairman of the Board (if any), the Vice Chairman of the Board (if any) nor the Chief Executive Officer is present, by a chairman designated by the Board of Directors. The Secretary of the Corporation, if present, shall act as secretary of such meetings, or if he is not present, an Assistant Secretary shall so act; if neither the Secretary nor an Assistant Secretary is present, then a secretary shall be appointed by the chairman of the meeting. The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at the meeting and the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seem to him in order. Unless the chairman of the meeting of stockholders shall otherwise determine, the order of business shall be as follows:
Conduct of Meeting
     (a) Calling of meeting to order.
 
     (b) Election of a chairman and the appointment of a secretary if necessary.
     (c) Presentation of proof of the due calling of the meeting.

     (e) Reading and settlement of the minutes of the previous meeting.
     (f) Reports of officers and committees.

     (h) Unfinished business.
     (i) New business.
     (j) Adjournment.
          Without limiting the foregoing, except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such presiding person, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the presiding person of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.
          SECTION 2.11. . Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.
Treasury Stock
          SECTION 2.12. .
Fixing Record Date; Action by Written Consent
          (a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date: (1)
 
in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting; (2) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors; and (3) in the case of any other action, shall not be more than 60 days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; (2) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action of the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation in accordance with applicable law, or, if prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action; and (3) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
          (b) In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by this Section 2.12 and applicable law, to the Corporation of written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Corporation shall engage independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of performing promptly a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent and without a meeting shall be effective until such inspectors have completed their review, determined that the requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents delivered to the Corporation in accordance with this Section 2.12 and applicable law have been obtained to authorize or take the action specified in the consents, and certified such determination for entry in the records of the Corporation kept for the purpose of recording the proceedings of meetings of stockholders. Nothing contained in this Section 2.12(b) shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
          (c) Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days after the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with this Section 2.12, a valid written consent or valid written consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take such action are delivered to the Corporation in the manner prescribed in this Section 2.12 and applicable law, and not revoked.

To be properly brought before an annual or special meeting, business must be (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, or the Board of Directors, (b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, or the Board of Directors, or (c) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder.
Stockholder Proposals

To be timely, a stockholder's notice with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation, not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days in advance of the date the Corporation's proxy statement was released to stockholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 70 days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the later of the 90 day prior to such annual meeting or the 10 day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. To be timely, a stockholder's notice with respect to a special meeting must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation, not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that less than 70 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the fifth (5) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the special meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made. Any stockholder may make any other proposal at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and the same may be discussed and considered, but unless stated in writing and filed with the Board of Directors or the Secretary prior to the date set forth above, no action with respect to such proposal shall be taken at such meeting and such proposal shall be laid over for action at an adjourned, special, or annual meeting of the stockholders taking place no earlier than 120 days after such meeting.

Notwithstanding anything in these by-laws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual or special meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.13. The chairman of the annual meeting or a special meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.13, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
          Notwithstanding any other provision of these by-laws, the Corporation shall be under no obligation to include any stockholder proposal in its proxy statement materials or otherwise present any such proposal to stockholders at a special or annual meeting of stockholders if the Board of Directors reasonably believes the proponents thereof have not complied with Sections 13 and 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the Corporation shall not be required to include in its proxy statement material to stockholders any stockholder proposal not required to be included in its proxy material to stockholders in accordance with such Act, rules, or regulations.

At the request of the Board of Directors any person nominated by the Board of Directors for election as a director shall furnish to the Secretary of the Corporation that information required to be set forth in a stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee.
          No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.14.
