Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE: WMI) today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2007. Revenues for the fourth quarter 2007 were $3.36 billion compared with $3.28 billion in the 2006 period, an increase of 2.4%. Net income for the quarter was $309 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, compared with $246 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2006, or a 32.6% increase in earnings per diluted share.
HOUSTON  February 13, 2008 
The Company noted several items that impacted the results in the 2006 and 2007 fourth quarters. Excluding these items, net income would have been $276 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared with $252 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2006, or a 14.9% increase in earnings per diluted share.
(a)
Income from operations as a percent of revenue, as adjusted for these items, increased 150 basis points to 16.9% in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared with 15.4% in the fourth quarter of 2006.
(a)
Results in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a net $0.07 per diluted share benefit consisting of:
Results in the fourth quarter of 2006 included a net charge of $0.01 per diluted share consisting of after-tax charges of $24 million for asset impairments and unusual items partially offset by a combined $18 million benefit to net income from income tax related items.
"We ended the year on a strong note and are poised for additional earnings growth in 2008. We grew revenues by 2.4% during the fourth quarter due mainly to our disciplined approach to pricing, which led to internal revenue growth on base business from yield of 3.3%, and the
 
strength of recycling commodity prices. Partially offsetting these increases were revenue declines caused by lower volumes of 3.8%, primarily in the collection lines of business, as well as the impact of divestitures of certain under-performing operations," stated David P. Steiner, Chief Executive Officer of Waste Management. "We are pleased with our accomplishments in both the fourth quarter and the full year as we exceeded our expectations for earnings per share growth, margin expansion and the generation of free cash flow."
For the full year 2007, the Company reported revenues of $13.31 billion compared with $13.36 billion in 2006. Earnings per diluted share were $2.23 for the full year 2007 compared with $2.10 for the full year 2006. Income from operations as a percent of revenue increased 170 basis points to 16.9% for the full year of 2007. During fiscal years 2006 and 2007, the Company noted in its earnings press releases a number of items that impacted the full-year results. Excluding the 2007 items, earnings per diluted share were an adjusted $2.07 for the full year 2007. Excluding the 2006 items, earnings per diluted share were an adjusted $1.81 for the full year 2006.On this basis, earnings per diluted share increased 14% during 2007.
(a)
Steiner continued, "We generated $593 million in net cash from operating activities and $146 million of free cash flowduring the quarter. For the year, we produced over $2.4 billion in net cash from operating activities and over $1.5 billion of free cash flow. We returned over $1.9 billion in cash to our shareholders during 2007, which was comprised of cash dividend payments of $495 million and share repurchases of $1.42 billion. Based on our market capitalization at the beginning of 2007, that is a pre-tax cash return of 9.7%.
(a)
"The fourth quarter 2007 was not without its challenges, including the impact of rising diesel fuel prices, and the increased phase-out of our Section 45K tax credits due to higher crude oil prices. Higher fuel costs caused a $0.01 per share reduction in net income because our fuel surcharge did not keep up with the steep increase in diesel fuel prices. Higher crude oil prices also caused us to lose Section 45K tax credits in the quarter. Coming into the fourth quarter of 2007, we had expected no benefit, but we actually lost $0.01 per share from Section 45K credits in the quarter."
Key Highlights for the Fourth Quarter 2007 and the Full Year 2007
 
Steiner continued, "The fourth quarter capped another successful year at Waste Management and we are proud of what we accomplished during 2007. We forecast that our full year 2008 earnings will increase to a range of $2.19 to $2.23 per diluted share. This is an 8 to 10% improvement over our further adjusted 2007 earnings per diluted share of $2.03, which excludes the $0.04 per share Section 45K tax benefit that we received in 2007 but will not receive in 2008.
"We expect the combination of our efforts to enhance the quality of our revenue along with our cost improvement programs will lead to continued expansion of our operating margin. We will again apply our strategy of utilizing standard tools and processes, particularly in the areas of labor efficiency, maintenance and safety, to improve and flex down operating costs.
"We are focused on maintaining our pricing discipline and improving our sales and marketing performance. We project that internal revenue growth on base business for 2008 will be about flat, which was not the case in 2007 when overall internal revenue growth on base business was a negative 1.2 percent. We also project the revenue we gain from acquisitions we expect to make during 2008 will exceed the revenue lost from divestitures that may occur during 2008. This was not the case in 2006 and 2007, when we were more focused on divesting underperforming operations."
Steiner concluded, "We remain committed to our goals of growing earnings, expanding our operating margins, increasing our return on invested capital and generating strong free cash flow. We plan to continue to utilize our disciplined pricing approach and our commitment to operational excellence to drive our financial performance."

The Company also announced the following with regard to its financial outlook for 2008:
