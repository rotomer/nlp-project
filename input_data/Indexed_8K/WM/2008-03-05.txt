On the basis of such review, the Company has reasonably concluded that such associated costs and liabilities would not, singly or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
     (hh) Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, each of the Company and its subsidiaries has fulfilled its obligations, if any, under the minimum funding standards of Section 302 of the United States Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("") and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder with respect to each "plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA and such regulations and published interpretations) in which employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to participate and each such plan is in compliance with the presently applicable provisions of ERISA and such regulations and published interpretations.

     (h) Subsequent to the Time of Sale, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
     (i) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and Holdings shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
     If any of the conditions specified in this Section 7 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.

     8. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 7 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 11 hereof (other than as a result of the occurrence of the circumstances in Sections 11(ii) and 11(iii)) or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through Banc of America Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Greenwich Capital Markets, Inc. on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
     9. . (a) Each of the Company and Holdings, jointly and severally, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or in any amendment thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing
Indemnification and Contribution
 
Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information, or arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; that neither the Company nor Holdings will be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company or Holdings may otherwise have.
provided, however,
          (b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and Holdings, each of their respective directors, each of their respective officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls either the Company or Holdings within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company or Holdings to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. Each of the Company and Holdings acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting", (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances, (iii) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids and (iv) the paragraph relating to internet distribution of the Securities in the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 9 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 9, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and shall not, without the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the
provided, however,
 
indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ a separate counsel (including a local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (ii) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party. An indemnifying party shall not be liable under this Section 9 to any indemnified party regarding any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent is consented to by such indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
          (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, Holdings and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively, "") to which the Company, Holdings and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and Holdings on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company, Holdings and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and Holdings on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company and Holdings shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company and Holdings on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, Holdings and the Underwriters agree that it would
Losses
provided, however,
 
not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this paragraph (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. For purposes of this Section 9, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company or Holdings within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company or Holdings who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company or Holdings shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company or Holdings, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
     10. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Notes set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter, the Company or Holdings. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Default by an Underwriter
provided, however,
     11. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission, (ii) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (iii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal, New York State or State of Texas authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or (iv) there shall have occurred any material change in the financial markets or any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, insurrection or armed conflict, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is

The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company and Holdings or their respective officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Company or Holdings or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 9 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 8 and 9 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

Indenture.

The Securities of this series are general unsecured obligations of the Company limited with an initial aggregate principal amount of $600,000,000.
     5. 
Redemption.
     The Securities will be redeemable, at the option of the Company, at any time in whole, or from time to time in part, at a Redemption Price (the "Make-Whole Price") equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed; or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (at the rate in effect on the date of calculation of the Redemption Price) on the Securities (exclusive of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable Treasury Yield plus 40 basis points; plus, in either case, accrued interest to the Redemption Date.
     Securities called for redemption become due on the Redemption Date. Notices of redemption will be mailed at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each holder of record of the Securities to be redeemed at its registered address. The notice of redemption for the Securities will state, among other things, the amount of Securities to be redeemed, the Redemption Date, the manner of determining the Make-Whole Price and the
 
place(s) that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of Securities to be redeemed. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Make-Whole Price, interest will cease to accrue on any Securities that have been called for redemption at the Redemption Date. If less than all the Securities are redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select the Securities to be redeemed on a pro rata basis or by any other method the Trustee deems fair and appropriate.
     For purposes of determining the Make-Whole Price, the following definitions are applicable:
     "Treasury Yield" means, with respect to any Redemption Date applicable to the Securities, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity (computed as of the third Business Day immediately preceding such Redemption Date) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the applicable Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Securities.

(and their respective successors), or, if all of such firms are unwilling or unable to select the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee and reasonably acceptable to the Company.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (i) the bid price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) at 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date, as set forth on "Telerate Page 500" (or such other page as may replace Telerate Page 500), or (ii) if such page (or any successor page) is not displayed or does not contain such bid prices at such time (a) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations obtained by the Trustee for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations obtained, or (b) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations obtained by the Trustee.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (i) each of Banc of America Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Greenwich Capital Markets, Inc.

     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date for the Securities, an average, as determined by the Trustee, of
 
the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue for the Securities (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
     Except as set forth above, the Securities will not be redeemable prior to their Stated Maturity and will not be entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund.
     The Securities may be redeemed in part in a minimum principal amount of $2,000, or any integral of $1,000 in excess thereof.
     Any such redemption will also comply with Article Eleven of the Indenture.
     6. 
Change of Control Offer
     If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem the Securities as described in Section 5, the Company shall make an offer (a "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder of the Securities to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder's Securities on the terms set forth herein. In a Change of Control Offer, the Company shall offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities repurchased (a "Change of Control Payment"), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Securities repurchased to the date of repurchase, subject to the right of holders of record on the applicable record date to receive interest due on the next Interest Payment Date.
     Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to Holders of the Securities describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offer to repurchase such Securities on the date specified in the applicable notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (a "Change of Control Payment Date"). The notice may, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the applicable Change of Control Payment Date.
     Upon the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful:
 
     The Company need not make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party repurchases all Securities properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company shall not repurchase any Securities if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
     The Company will comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act''), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions of this Security, the Company may comply with those securities laws and regulations and, if so, will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Offer provisions of this Security by virtue of any such conflict.

     "Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or more series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the Company's assets and the assets of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person, other than the Company or one of its Subsidiaries; (2) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any person becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the outstanding Voting Stock of the Company or other Voting Stock into which the Company's Voting Stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; (3) the Company consolidates with, or merges with or into, any person, or any person consolidates with, or merges with or into, the Company, in any such event pursuant to a transaction in which any of the outstanding Voting Stock of the Company or the Voting Stock of such other person is converted into or exchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than any such transaction where the shares of the Voting Stock of the Company outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitute, or are converted into or exchanged for, a majority of the Voting Stock of the surviving person or any direct or indirect parent company of the surviving person, measured by voting power rather than number of shares, immediately after giving effect to such transaction; (4) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company are not Continuing Directors; or (5) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation or dissolution of the Company.
     Notwithstanding the preceding, a transaction will not be deemed to involve a Change of Control under clause (2) above if (i) the Company becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (ii)(A) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of Voting Stock of the Company immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no person (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of such holding company. The term person,'' as used in this definition, has the meaning given thereto in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.

     "Rating Event" means the rating on the Securities is lowered by at least two of the three Rating Agencies and the Securities are rated below an Investment Grade Rating by at least two of the three Rating Agencies, in any case on any day during the period (which period will be extended so long as the rating of the Securities is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the rating agencies) commencing 60 days prior to the first public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control or the Company's intention to effect a Change of Control and ending 60 days following consummation of such Change of Control.

     10. 
Defaults and Remedies.
     If an Event of Default with respect to the Securities occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding may declare the principal amount of all the Securities to be due and payable immediately in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Event of Default or shall impair any right consequent thereon. Holders of Securities may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require indemnity satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the Securities. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power.

Exhibit 5.1
March 5, 2008
Waste Management, Inc. Waste Management Holdings, Inc. 1001 Fannin Street, Suite 4000 Houston, Texas 77002
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          Waste Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Waste Management Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Holdings"), have engaged us to render the opinions expressed below in connection with the Company's proposed issuance of $600,000,000 principal amount of 6.10% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "Notes") and the issuance of the related guarantees of the Notes by Holdings (the "Guarantees"), as contemplated by the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-137526), as amended by Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 (the "Registration Statement"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), relating to the offering of securities of the Company and of Holdings from time to time pursuant to Rule 415 under the Act.
          The Registration Statement has been filed with the Commission and became effective upon filing. The Company's prospectus dated September 22, 2006 and prospectus supplement dated March 3, 2008 relating to the Notes (collectively, the "Prospectus") have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act.
          The Company and Holdings entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement"), dated March 3, 2008, with Banc of America Securities LLC, Greenwich Capital Markets, Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as representatives of the underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), relating to the issuance and sale by the Company to the Underwriters of $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be issued pursuant to an Indenture (the "Indenture") dated as of September 10, 1997 between the Company, formerly known as USA Waste Services, Inc., and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N. A., as successor to Texas Commerce Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee").
 
          In our capacity as counsel to the Company and Holdings in connection with the matters referred to above, we have examined the following: (i) the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Company, each as amended to date; (ii) the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Holdings, each as amended to date; (iii) the Indenture; (iv) the Guarantee to be entered into by Holdings in favor of the holders of the Notes concurrently with the issuance of the Notes under the Indenture (the "Guarantee Agreement"); (v) the Underwriting Agreement; (vi) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus; and (vii) originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified, of corporate records of the Company and Holdings, certificates of public officials and of representatives of the Company and Holdings, statutes and other instruments and documents as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. We have relied upon certificates of officers of the Company and Holdings and of public officials with respect to the accuracy of the material factual matters contained in such certificates. In making our examination, we have assumed that all signatures on documents examined by us are genuine, all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic and all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies conformed with the originals of such documents.
          In connection with this opinion, we have assumed that the Notes will be issued and sold in compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and in the manner stated in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.
          On the basis of the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth herein, we are of the opinion that (i) the Notes will, when they have been duly authorized, executed, authenticated, issued and delivered in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and duly purchased and paid for in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against it in accordance with their terms, except to the extent that the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (ii) the Guarantees will, when Holdings has duly authorized, executed and delivered the Guarantee Agreement and the Notes have been duly authorized, executed, authenticated, issued and delivered in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and duly purchased and paid for in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of Holdings enforceable against it in accordance with their terms, except to the extent that the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
          The opinions set forth above are limited in all respects to matters of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the contract law of the State of New York, and applicable federal laws of the United States, each as currently in effect.
          We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion of counsel as Exhibit 5.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 3, 2008 and to the incorporation by reference of this opinion of counsel into the Registration Statement. We also consent to the reference to our Firm under the heading "Legal
 
Matters" in the Prospectus. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
