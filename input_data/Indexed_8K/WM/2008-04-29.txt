WMI #08-06
Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE: WMI) today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2008. Net income for the quarter was $241 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, compared with $238 million, or $0.45 per diluted share in the prior year period.
HOUSTON  April 29, 2008 
Revenue for the first quarter of 2008 was $3.27 billion as compared with $3.19 billion in the year ago period, an increase of 2.4%. Income from operations as a percent of revenue improved by 50 basis points from the prior year period to 15.6% in the first quarter of 2008.
The Company noted several items that impacted the results in the 2007 and 2008 first quarters. Results in the first quarter of 2008 included a net $0.01 per diluted share benefit due to a $6 million benefit in net income from income tax audit settlements. Results in the first quarter of 2007 included a net $0.02 per diluted share benefit consisting of a $16 million benefit in net income from income tax audit settlements and a $6 million reduction in net income due to restructuring charges.
Excluding those items, earnings would have been $0.47 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2008 compared with $0.43 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2007. This is a 9.3% increase in adjusted earnings per diluted share.

"We started the year on a solid note as we again accomplished our primary financial goals of earnings growth, margin expansion and strong free cash flow," said David P. Steiner, Chief Executive Officer of Waste Management. "The 9.3% growth in adjusted earnings per share is an impressive accomplishment in the current business environment. It is even more impressive when you consider that we had a $0.02 per diluted share benefit in Section 45K tax credits in the first quarter of 2007. The Section 45K program expired at the end of 2007. Excluding that benefit, year-over-year earnings would have grown 14.6% in the first quarter of 2008.
(a)
"We grew revenue by 2.4% during the first quarter of 2008, due mainly to our disciplined approach to pricing, which led to internal revenue growth from yield on base business of 3.2%. We also benefited from higher recycling commodity prices, which contributed an additional 2.3% to revenue growth. Partially offsetting these increases were declines in internal revenue growth from volumes of 3.9%, mostly in the collection lines of business, as well as the carry-
 
over impact of divestitures of certain under-performing operations, which occurred principally during the 2007 fiscal year.
"We overcame several challenges during the first quarter of 2008, including the impact of sharply rising diesel fuel prices, a slow economy and harsh winter weather in the Midwest. Higher diesel fuel prices caused an approximate $0.01 per share reduction in earnings during the quarter because the increase in our fuel surcharge revenue lagged the sharp rise in diesel fuel prices; and this also caused an approximate 50 basis point decline in income from operations as a percent of revenue. Excluding this negative 50 basis point impact, our income from operations as a percent of revenue increased by 100 basis points in the first quarter of this year compared with the prior year period, in line with our expectations. We estimate that the winter weather conditions caused a $0.01 per share decline in net income during the first quarter of this year."
(a)
Steiner continued, "We overcame a number of challenges by continuing our focus on pricing and operational excellence and executing our strategy of reviewing low margin accounts and increasing prices or culling that business. And we again produced strong free cash flow that we returned to shareholders in the form of our dividend and share repurchases. We generated $561 million in net cash from operating activities and $362 million of free cash flowduring the quarter."

Key Highlights for the First Quarter of 2008
Steiner concluded, "Despite the slow economy, we are off to a good start for the year. We continued to execute our disciplined pricing and cost control strategies and we overcame the
 
challenges during the quarter. Our success during the first quarter gives us confidence that we can achieve our previously projected full-year earnings of $2.19 to $2.23 per diluted share and free cash flow of $1.4 billion."
