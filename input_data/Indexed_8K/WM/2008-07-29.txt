WMI #08-14
Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE: WMI) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2008. Revenue for the second quarter of 2008 was $3.49 billion compared with $3.36 billion in the year ago period, an increase of 3.9%. Net income for the quarter was $318 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared with $338 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, in the prior year period.
HOUSTON  July 29, 2008 
The Company noted several items that impacted the results in the 2007 and 2008 second quarters. Results in the second quarter of 2008 included a net $0.01 per diluted share benefit from income tax items. Results in the second quarter of 2007 included a combined benefit of $0.08 per diluted share consisting of $0.05 per diluted share from income tax items and $0.03 per diluted share from divestitures of under-performing operations.
Excluding those items, earnings would have been $311 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2008 compared with $296 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2007. This is a 12.5% increase in adjusted earnings per diluted share.
(a)
Income from operations as a percent of revenue was 18.1% in the second quarter of 2008. This is a 20 basis point improvement compared with the second quarter of 2007, as adjusted for the items noted above.
For the six months ended June 30, 2008, Waste Management reported operating revenue of $6.76 billion, compared with $6.55 billion for the same period last year. Net income was $559 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2008, compared with $576 million and $1.09 per diluted share, respectively, for the same period in 2007.
"We are pleased with our second quarter 2008 financial performance, as we again accomplished our primary goals of strong free cash flow, and adjusted earnings and operating margin expansion," said David P. Steiner, Chief Executive Officer of Waste Management. "Our financial performance continues to reflect the strength of our managers and the success of our pricing and operational excellence programs. The 12.5% growth in adjusted earnings per share
 
is an impressive accomplishment in the current business environment. It is even more impressive when you consider that we had a $0.03 per diluted share benefit from Section 45K tax credits in the second quarter of 2007 and no benefit in 2008, as the program has expired. Excluding that benefit, year-over-year earnings per diluted share would have grown nearly 19% in the second quarter of 2008.
(a)
"We grew revenue by 3.9% during the second quarter of 2008, due mainly to our disciplined approach to pricing, which led to internal revenue growth from yield on base business of 3.1%. We also benefited from higher recycling commodity prices, which contributed 1.7% to revenue growth, and higher fuel surcharge revenue, which contributed an additional 2.2% to revenue growth. Internal revenue growth from yield for municipal solid waste stood at the highest level we have seen in the last two and one-half years. Internal revenue growth from volumes declined 3.8%, mostly in the collection lines of business. At our landfills, we saw positive year-over- year internal revenue growth for the first time since the first quarter of 2007."
"Steiner continued, "We once again met our goal of producing strong cash from operations during the second quarter of 2008, generating $570 million in net cash from operations, a 6% year-over-year increase. Capital expenditures were $273 million, a $64 million increase compared with the prior year quarter. This was an expected increase in accordance with our capital plan for the year, which includes increased fleet purchases. We received only $24 million in net proceeds from divestitures this quarter, a $123 million decline from the second quarter of 2007, as we have fewer under-performing operations for sale this year. As a result, we produced $321 million in free cash flow during the second quarter of 2008 compared with $475 million in the prior year quarter. At $683 million of free cash flow for the first six months of 2008, we are on track to meet our free cash flow goal for the year.
"We overcame the impact of sharply rising diesel fuel prices and a slow economy during the second quarter of 2008. Higher diesel fuel prices caused an approximate $0.015 per diluted share reduction in earnings during the quarter because the increase in our fuel surcharge revenue lagged the sharp rise in diesel fuel prices. This also caused an approximate 80 basis point decline in income from operations as a percent of revenue. Excluding this 80 basis point impact, our income from operations as a percent of revenue increased to 18.9% in the second quarter of this year, a 100 basis point improvement when compared with the as adjusted prior year period. This is in line with our full year expectations."
(a)
Key Highlights for the Second Quarter of 2008
 
Steiner concluded, "We had a great first half of 2008, and our business remains healthy as we enter the last half of the year. Consequently, we are confident that we will meet the upper end of the range of our previously announced full-year earnings guidance of $2.19 to $2.23 per diluted share. We also expect to achieve our free cash flow guidance of $1.4 billion. In each case we exclude costs associated with our proposal to acquire Republic Services. We remain committed to making that acquisition in a timely manner, and we believe we can integrate their operations while at the same time continuing to produce strong financial results from our operations."
The Company also discusses free cash flow and projected free cash flow, which are non-GAAP measures, because it believes that investors are interested in the cash produced by the Company from non-financing activities that is available for uses such as the Company's acquisitions, its share repurchase program, and the payment of dividends. However, free cash flow has material limitations, as it does not represent cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that we have committed to such as debt service obligations. The Company defines free cash flow as:
The Company's definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and therefore not subject to comparison.
 
The quantitative reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, other than projections of earnings per diluted share, are included in the accompanying schedules. Investors are urged to take into account GAAP measures as well as non-GAAP measures in evaluating the Company.
The 2008 full year adjusted earnings of $2.19 to $2.23 per diluted share projected by the Company excludes the first quarter impact of a $6 million income tax audit settlement and the second quarter impact of $7 million in income tax audit settlements. GAAP net earnings per diluted share for the remaining two quarters of 2008 may include other items that are not currently determinable, but may be significant, such as asset impairment and unusual items; charges, gains or losses from divestitures; additional resolution of income tax items; or any costs incurred as a result of our proposal to acquire all of the shares of Republic Services, Inc. that may be expensed. The full year 2008 adjusted projected earnings per diluted share reaffirmed today excludes the impact of any such items that may occur. GAAP net earnings per diluted share projected for the full year would require inclusion of the projected impact of these items. Due to the uncertainty of the likelihood, amount and timing of any such items, we do not believe we have the information available to provide projected full year GAAP net earnings per diluted share and the quantitative reconciliation to our current adjusted earnings per diluted share projection.
