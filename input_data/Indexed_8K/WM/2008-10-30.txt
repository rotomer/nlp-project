WMI #08-21
Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE: WMI) today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2008. Revenue for the third quarter of 2008 was $3.53 billion compared with $3.40 billion in the year ago period, an increase of 3.6%. Net income for the quarter was $310 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, compared with $278 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, in the prior year period, an increase of 16.7% in earnings per diluted share.
HOUSTON  October 30, 2008 
The Company noted several items that impacted the results in the 2007 and 2008 third quarters. Results in the third quarter of 2008 included an after-tax benefit of $0.03 per diluted share due to gains from the divestiture of operations offset by a decrease of $0.03 per diluted share related to the cost of a labor disruption in Milwaukee, including more than a $0.02 per diluted share charge related to the local bargaining unit agreeing to our proposal to withdraw the bargaining unit from the Teamsters' under-funded Central States pension fund.
Results in the third quarter of 2007 included a decrease of $0.03 per diluted share related to the cost of a labor disruption in Oakland offset by a $0.03 per diluted share benefit from income tax items.
Excluding those items, earnings would have been $312 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2008 compared with $280 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2007.
(a)
Income from operations as a percent of revenue was 18.0% in the third quarter of 2008, a 60 basis point improvement compared with the third quarter of 2007, both periods adjusted for the items noted above.
(a)
For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, Waste Management reported operating revenue of $10.28 billion, compared with $9.95 billion for the same period last year. Net income was $869 million, or $1.75 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, compared with net income of $854 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, for the same period in 2007.
 
"We have delivered another solid financial performance, and accomplished our primary goals of earnings growth, operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow," said David P. Steiner, Chief Executive Officer of Waste Management. "Our financial performance continues to be driven by the success of our pricing and operational excellence programs. We are very happy with the 16.7% growth in adjusted earnings per share which demonstrates the strength of our business, even in a slowing economy.
(a)
"Revenue grew by 3.6% during the third quarter of 2008. Internal revenue growth from yield on base business was 2.7%. Including the positive impact of higher recycling commodity prices and higher fuel surcharge revenue, internal revenue growth from yield was 6.5%. Internal revenue growth at our landfills was at the highest level since the third quarter of 2006 and internal revenue growth from yield in our municipal solid waste disposal line was at the highest level since 2005.
"Our operational excellence and pricing excellence programs continue to improve operating margins. Excluding a 40 basis point impact from higher diesel fuel prices, our as-adjusted income from operations as a percent of revenue increased to 18.4% in the third quarter of this year. This is a 100 basis point improvement when compared with the as-adjusted income from operations as a percent of revenue for the prior year period. We also overcame the impact of a slowing economy and difficult credit markets during the third quarter of 2008, displaying the defensive nature of our business.
(a)
"The recycling commodity markets have become very volatile over the last two weeks. During 2008, we have benefited from high recycling commodity prices. We do not expect a year-over-year benefit in the fourth quarter. In fact, we currently estimate that our recycling line of business could negatively impact earnings per share by as much as $0.03 in the fourth quarter. We expect our solid waste business, with its recession resistant qualities and strong cash flows, to perform very well, just as it has all year."
Key Highlights for the Third Quarter of 2008
 
The Company also discusses free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure, because it believes that investors are interested in the cash produced by the Company from non-financing activities that is available for uses such as the Company's acquisitions, its share repurchase program, and the payment of dividends. However, free cash flow has material limitations, as it does not represent cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that we have committed to such as debt service obligations. The Company defines free cash flow as:
The Company's definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and therefore not subject to comparison.
The quantitative reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the accompanying schedules. Investors are urged to take into account GAAP measures as well as non-GAAP measures in evaluating the Company.
