     On the conference call, management of the Company is expected to discuss its results of operations and projections using certain non-GAAP financial measures that are disclosed in the press release attached as exhibit 99.1. The Company has provided an explanation of its use of such non-GAAP measures, as well as a reconciliation of each of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, in the press release and the schedules thereto.
     Additionally, it is expected that management will discuss the effect that lower prices and demand for recycling commodities had on the Company's results of operations. Management believes that providing results of operations without the effect of recycling is important to show investors the significant impact the markets for recycling commodities have had on our business.

     Management also will discuss certain operating margins on an adjusted basis. By excluding items that we do not believe to be operational in nature, investors are able to view the business in the same manner that management does and evaluate our performance without the effect of costs for items we do not believe are indicative of our performance.

WMI #09-02
Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE: WMI) today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2008. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $3.11 billion compared with $3.36 billion for the same 2007 period. Net income for the quarter was $218 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, compared with $309 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2007.
HOUSTON  February 12, 2009 
For the full year 2008, the Company reported revenues of $13.39 billion compared with $13.31 billion for 2007. Earnings per diluted share were $2.19 for the full year 2008 compared with $2.23 for the full year 2007. During fiscal years 2008 and 2007, several items impacted the full year results. On an as adjusted basis taking those items into account, earnings per diluted share were $2.22 for the full year 2008 and $2.07 for the full year 2007, an increase of 7.2% for 2008.
(a)
"The fourth quarter was a challenge on a number of fronts, and I am pleased with the way we have reacted to the tough economic circumstances. Despite the challenges, our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter beat consensus, we met our full year expectations for earnings per share, we increased our adjusted margins, and we generated strong free cash flow," stated David P. Steiner, Chief Executive Officer of Waste Management. "We have consistently shown the ability to generate strong free cash flow, and we have exhibited this strength once again. Full year 2008 net cash from operations increased $136 million and free cash flow for the year exceeded the $1.4 billion we forecasted at the beginning of the year."
(a)
The Company noted several items that impacted results in the 2008 and 2007 fourth quarters. Excluding these items, net income would have been $241 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with $276 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2007.
(a)
Results in the fourth quarter of 2008 included a decrease of $0.05 per diluted share from:
 
Results in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a net benefit of $0.07 per diluted share consisting of a $31 million income tax benefit resulting primarily from a reduction in Canadian income tax rates; a $7 million benefit in net income due to gains from divestitures of operations; and a $5 million reduction in net income related to labor disruptions in California.
"As we anticipated in November 2008, we did see a negative impact of $0.08 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with the prior year period, as a result of the deterioration of the recycling commodities markets," stated Steiner. "Conditions have stabilized somewhat, but we still expect a negative year over year impact from recycling operations of $0.15 to $0.20 for the full year 2009, most of which is expected to be in the first half of the year."
Key Highlights for the Fourth Quarter and the Full Year 2008
Steiner added, "The majority of our business, which relates to commercial and residential customers, is recession resistant, and the fourth quarter reflected that. Internal revenue growth from volume in those lines was consistent across all quarters of 2008. But the sharp decline in economic activity in the fourth quarter did cause further volume declines in our more economically sensitive industrial collection, transfer and recycling businesses. Recycling commodity revenues were affected by both steep price declines and greatly reduced volumes as a result of the lack of demand for these commodities. We expect volumes in these economically sensitive lines of business to remain soft in 2009. So, we will redouble our focus on pricing discipline and driving continued efficiency throughout our organization. On the pricing front, we are setting minimum yield targets for each of our Market Areas, Groups and the Corporation.
 
These targets must be met in order for eligible employees to receive the financial performance portion of their 2009 annual bonuses. This will help to ensure that we maintain our focus on our pricing programs in 2009."
The Company announced a reorganization that will cost approximately $50 million to implement, but will result in annualized savings in excess of $100 million.
Savings will result from:
"Our recent actions have prepared our company to perform well in a slow economy. As a company that focuses on free cash flow, we expect that through a combination of pricing, expense control and capital discipline we will achieve between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion of free cash flow in 2009," Steiner continued.
(a)
"We expect that in 2009 we will acquire more revenue than we divest, as valuations and prices for assets reach lower levels. We believe our new organization makes us more nimble and able to assimilate acquired operations. However, we will not make any acquisitions that would jeopardize our strong balance sheet or our credit rating."
Steiner concluded, "The fourth quarter demonstrated the strength of our business model during a very challenging economic time. The recession resistant qualities and strong cash flows of our solid waste business, combined with the proactive steps we are taking to strengthen our pricing programs and reduce our costs, give us confidence that we will continue to generate strong cash returns for our shareholders and emerge from this economic downturn even stronger than before."
