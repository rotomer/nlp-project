Item 2.02 is corrected and restated in its entirety; there were no changes to the other information set forth in the Form 8-K or the exhibit attached to the Original Report.
Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     Waste Management, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release this morning, announcing its earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, a copy of which is attached hereto as exhibit 99.1.
     The Company is holding a conference call, open to the public, to discuss these results, from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. Central time this morning. The call will be webcast live, and may be heard by accessing the Company's website at www.wm.com. The call may also be listened to by calling (877) 710-6139 and entering the access code 16261765. The replay of the call can be listened to by dialing (800) 642-1687 and entering the access code 16261765.
     On the conference call, management of the Company is expected to discuss results of operations using certain non-GAAP financial measures that are included in the Company's press release. The Company has provided information regarding its use of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations of them to their most comparable GAAP measures in the press release that is attached to this Form 8-K as exhibit 99.1 and the schedules thereto.
     Management also is expected to discuss operating expenses as a percentage of revenue as adjusted for the negative impact of the costs to withdraw from an underfunded multi-employer pension plan. Management believes that a discussion of this non-GAAP measure provides investors with information to enable them to evaluate the Company's ability to manage its normal operating costs as revenues have declined. The non-GAAP information should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.
     The reconciliation of operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to the adjusted measure is shown below (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):
 
 
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
