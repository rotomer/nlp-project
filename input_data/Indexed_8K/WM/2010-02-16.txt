Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE: WM) today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2009. Net income for the quarter was $315 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared with $218 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2008. This is an increase in earnings per diluted share of 45%. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $3.01 billion compared with $3.11 billion for the same 2008 period. The Company noted several items that impacted results in the 2009 and 2008 fourth quarters. Excluding these items, net income would have been $257 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with $241 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2008.
HOUSTON  February 16, 2010 
(a)
(b)
For the full year 2009, the Company reported revenues of $11.79 billion compared with $13.39 billion for 2008. Earnings per diluted share were $2.01 for the full year 2009 compared with $2.19 for the full year 2008. During fiscal years 2009 and 2008, several items impacted the full year results. On an as-adjusted basis taking those items into account, earnings per diluted share were $2.00 for the full year 2009 and $2.22 for the full year 2008.
(b)
David P. Steiner, Chief Executive Officer of Waste Management, commented, "We saw encouraging signs of improvement in the fourth quarter. Internal revenue growth from volume declined by 6.4% compared with the prior year period, which was a 250 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2009. Our commercial and residential business lines continued to demonstrate their strength. Commercial revenue, excluding revenue from our fuel surcharge, increased 1.0% compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. Residential revenue, excluding revenue from our fuel surcharge, performed even better, increasing by 1.5% compared with the prior year period. Our collection and disposal pricing remained strong, with internal revenue growth from yield of 2.7%. Average recycling commodity prices continued to increase each month in the fourth quarter, and have almost doubled from the lows reached in January 2009. And, on the cost side, 2009 savings from the company-wide restructuring we announced in February 2009 exceeded our target of $120 million on an annualized basis."
Results in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a net benefit of $0.12 per diluted share consisting of an $81 million income tax benefit resulting primarily from the favorable impacts of the carry-back of a capital loss and a revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from reductions in Canadian tax rates; a $20 million reduction in net income from asset impairment charges; and a $3 million reduction in net income from charges related to the restructuring announced in February 2009.
 
Results in the fourth quarter of 2008 included a decrease of $0.05 per diluted share from a $13 million reduction in net income due to charges related to withdrawal from union-sponsored multi-employer pension plans in Milwaukee, New Jersey and Detroit; a $16 million reduction in net income caused primarily by the accounting effect of a decline in long-term interest rates, which are used to calculate the present value of the Company's remediation liabilities at its landfills; and a $6 million benefit resulting primarily from favorable tax audit settlements.
Key Highlights for the Fourth Quarter 2009 and the Full Year 2009
Steiner continued, "New business pricing was strong for both our commercial and industrial business lines, and service increases offset service decreases for the second quarter in a row, which are further encouraging signs of improvement in our business. So, as we look to 2010, we expect the rate of decline in volumes to continue to show improvement during the first half of the year, and we expect volumes for the second half of the year to be flat to slightly positive. We forecast that our full year 2010 earnings will increase to a range of $2.09 to $2.13 per diluted share."
(b)
Steiner concluded, "We are proud of what we accomplished in 2009. During the economic downturn we continued producing strong cash flow and returned a big portion of it to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we returned $302 million of cash in the form of dividends and
 
common stock repurchases and for the full year we returned $795 million. For 2010 the Board of Directors has announced its intent to increase our quarterly dividend by 8.6%, to $1.26 per share on an annual basis. The Board of Directors approved a capital allocation plan that authorizes up to $1.3 billion to be returned to shareholders. We expect our dividend payments to be approximately $615 million, which allows for up to $685 million to be allocated to common stock repurchases. We remain committed to our goals of growing earnings, expanding our operating margins, increasing our return on invested capital, generating strong free cash flow and returning cash to our shareholders."
2010 Outlook
The Company also announced the following with regard to its financial outlook for 2010:
 
 
The Company also discusses free cash flow and projected free cash flow, each of which is a non-GAAP measure, because it believes that investors are interested in the cash produced by the Company from non-financing activities that is available for uses such as the Company's acquisitions, its share repurchase program, and the payment of dividends. However, free cash flow has material limitations, as it does not represent cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that we have committed to such as debt service obligations. The Company defines free cash flow as:
The Company's definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and therefore not subject to comparison.
The quantitative reconciliations of each of the non-GAAP measures presented herein other than projected earnings per diluted share to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the accompanying schedules. Investors are urged to take into account GAAP measures as well as non-GAAP measures in evaluating the Company.
The Company's full year earnings projection of $2.09 to $2.13 per diluted share excludes the effects of any events or circumstances in 2010 that management deems to be unusual items or that management believes are not representative or indicative of our results of operations. GAAP net earnings per diluted share for 2010 may include items that are not currently determinable, but may be significant, such as asset impairment and unusual items, charges, gains or losses from divestitures, resolution of income tax items or other items. The full year 2010 adjusted projected earnings announced today excludes the impact of any such items that may occur. GAAP net earnings per diluted share projected for the full year would require inclusion of the projected impact of these items. Due to the uncertainty of the likelihood, amount and timing of any such items, we do not believe we have the information available to provide projected full year GAAP net earnings per diluted share and the quantitative reconciliation to our current adjusted earning per diluted share projection.
The Company has scheduled an investor and analyst conference call for later this morning to discuss the results of today's earnings announcement. The information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the information on the conference call. The call will begin at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time and is open to the public.
