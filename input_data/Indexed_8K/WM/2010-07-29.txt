Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE: WM) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2010. Revenue for the second quarter of 2010 was $3.16 billion compared with $2.95 billion for the same 2009 period, an increase of $206 million, or 7.0%.

HOUSTON  July 29, 2010 
(a)
The Company noted certain items that impacted results in the 2010 and 2009 second quarters. Excluding these items, net income would have been $261 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2010 compared with $256 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2009.
(b)
Results in the second quarter of 2010 included a net decrease of $0.03 per diluted share from:
Results in the second quarter of 2009 included a net decrease of $0.02 per diluted share from the combined effects of charges related to the restructuring announced in February 2009 and to the withdrawal from a Teamsters' under-funded multi-employer pension plan.
In addition to the above, the Company had a non-cash charge of $10 million, or approximately $0.01 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2010, arising from the accounting effect of lower ten-year Treasury rates, which are used to discount remediation reserves at the Company's landfills.
 
David P. Steiner, Chief Executive Officer of Waste Management, commented, "Business conditions continued to improve during the second quarter of 2010. Revenue increased seven percent compared with the second quarter of 2009 and volume comparisons continued to show improving trends.
"Our internal revenue growth from yield for our collection and disposal business was 2.3%, an improvement compared with the first quarter of 2010. Through our disciplined focus on pricing we overcame much of the first half effect of low and even negative consumer price indices, which are used to adjust prices in our municipal and franchise contracts."
Steiner continued, "Internal revenue growth from volume declined by 2.9% in the second quarter of 2010, compared with the prior year period. This is the third consecutive quarter in which volume declines have moderated. As we look at volumes for the remainder of 2010, we expect the positive recent trends to continue and for year-over-year volume comparisons to be positive for the second half of 2010."
Key Highlights for the Second Quarter 2010
 
Steiner added "We remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders while at the same time making investments that will increase future cash flows. In the second quarter, in addition to our common stock repurchases and dividends paid, we also completed about $43 million of tuck-in and other acquisitions, and we closed on our previously announced $150 million purchase from the Southeastern Public Service Authority of a waste-to-energy facility located in Portsmouth, Virginia."
Steiner concluded, "Volume and pricing trends point to continuing improvement during the second half of 2010. We expect average commodity prices during the second half of 2010 to be above second-half 2009 commodity prices. Given these positive trends, we are confident that we are on track to meet our previously announced full-year 2010 earnings guidance range of $2.09 to $2.13 per diluted share. We also continue to expect to generate free cash flow in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion for the year."
