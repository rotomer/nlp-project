WM #10-14
Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE: WM) today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2010. Revenue for the third quarter of 2010 was $3.24 billion compared with $3.02 billion for the same 2009 period, an increase of $212 million, or 7.0%. Net income for the quarter was $244 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, compared with $277 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2009.
HOUSTON  October 28, 2010 
(a)
The Company noted certain items that impacted the third quarter results for 2010 and 2009. Excluding these items, net income would have been $264 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2010 compared with $265 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2009.
(b)
Results in the third quarter of 2010 included a net decrease of $0.04 per diluted share from the following:
Results in the 2009 third quarter included a net benefit of $0.02 per diluted share from the combined effects of favorable income tax adjustments and charges related to the restructuring announced in February 2009.
David P. Steiner, Chief Executive Officer of Waste Management, commented, "When we look at our earnings, our collection, landfill and recycling businesses all performed solidly during the quarter. Each of these business lines increased operating earnings and improved operating margins compared with the prior year period. Overall, our results for the quarter did not meet our internal expectations, but if we look just at our traditional solid waste business, we would have earned $0.60 per diluted share, in line with our expectations. Two items caused a $0.05 headwind to earnings in the quarter. First, we had unexpected maintenance and other costs of $0.02 per diluted share at our Wheelabrator operations. Second, we had a $0.03 headwind from certain of our growth initiatives, primarily from
 
our new Bagster product offering and our initiatives in medical waste. These initiatives are in the start-up phase and we have a lot of typical start-up costs, such as advertising and new sales personnel. However, we are seeing good revenue growth in both lines of business, with Bagster growing over 20% per month over the last six months and our medical waste business growing 30% sequentially from the second to the third quarter. So, we have a short-term headwind from start-up costs associated with our growth initiatives, but we believe these initiatives will create long-term shareholder value."
Steiner continued, "Our internal revenue growth from yield for our collection and disposal business was 2.3%, consistent with the second quarter of 2010. We continue our focus on pricing and we remain committed to pricing of at least 50 to 100 basis points above CPI. Internal revenue growth from volume declined by 0.7% in the third quarter of 2010, compared with the prior year period. This is the fourth consecutive quarter in which the rate of volume decline has improved."
Key Highlights for the Third Quarter 2010
Steiner concluded, "In the third quarter, in addition to our common stock repurchases and dividends paid, we completed $122 million of tuck-in and other acquisitions. Our cash flow remains strong, as we generated $424 million of free cash flow in the third quarter of 2010 and $952 million year-to-date. We continue to expect full-year 2010 free cash flow in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion.
(b)
 
"We remain committed to our pricing discipline, and we expect that recycling commodity prices will remain strong. We believe collection and disposal volumes will continue to improve, and will be slightly positive in the fourth quarter. We are also redoubling our cost control efforts, and expect to see improvement in our cost structure in the fourth quarter. Given these factors, we expect our fully diluted adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2010 to be between $0.54 and $0.56."
