Excluding these items, net income would have been $287 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with $257 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2009, an increase in earnings per diluted share of over 15%.

(b)
For the full year 2010, the Company reported revenues of $12.52 billion compared with $11.79 billion for 2009. Earnings per diluted share were $1.98 for the full year 2010 compared with $2.01 for the full year 2009. During fiscal years 2010 and 2009, several items impacted the full year results. On an as-adjusted basis taking those items into account, earnings per diluted share were $2.09 for the full year 2010 and $2.00 for the full year 2009.
(b)
Results in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a net decrease of $0.01 per diluted share consisting of the following:
David P. Steiner, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waste Management, commented, "We are pleased that we exceeded our expectations for the fourth quarter, driven by strong internal revenue growth from yield, which offset lower than expected volumes. Our collection, landfill, and recycling businesses continued their strong performance, as each of these business lines increased both their operating earnings and operating margins compared with the prior year period."

Steiner added, "We finished the year with our strongest quarterly pricing performance of 2010, with internal revenue growth from yield of 2.6% for our collection and disposal business. We once again demonstrated our pricing discipline, and we remain committed to pricing of at least 50 to 100 basis points above CPI. As for our volumes, internal revenue growth from volume declined by 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with the prior year period. Volumes were down in the collection line of business, primarily because of the loss of certain residential contracts and severe winter weather. Volumes continue to be strong in our landfill line of business.
"We are proud of our 2010 accomplishments. We continued to produce strong cash flow and continued our strategy of returning cash to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we returned $208 million of cash in the form of dividends and common stock repurchases, and for the full year, we returned $1.1 billion.
"For 2011, we expect internal revenue growth from volume to be flat to slightly positive. January volumes were still soft, reflecting the severe winter weather throughout North America, but we expect the remainder of the year to show steady improvement. We expect internal revenue growth from yield in 2011 of approximately 2.0%. The consumer price index has been running close to 1.0%, whereas at this time last year CPI was running above 2.0%. This decrease in the consumer price index will negatively impact pricing on the roughly 40% of our collection business that has annual price adjustments based on a published price index. In 2010, the effect of CPI negatively impacted yield by approximately 70 basis points. But, just as we did in 2010, we expect to overcome the
 
effect of CPI to produce strong pricing in 2011.
"Based on these yield and volume estimates and other assumptions, we forecast that our full-year 2011 adjusted earnings will be in the range of $2.24 to $2.30 per diluted share. Free cash flow is projected to be in the range of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion, with capital expenditures of between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion.
(b)
"The Board of Directors has announced its intent to increase our quarterly dividend by 8%, to $1.36 per share on an annual basis. We expect our dividend payments to total approximately $650 million in 2011, and we expect common stock repurchases of up to $575 million. In 2011 we will continue to make investments to grow our business, and we remain committed to our goals of growing our revenues, expanding our operating margins, increasing our return on invested capital, increasing our free cash flow and returning cash to our shareholders."
2011 OUTLOOK
The Company also announced the following with regard to its financial outlook for 2011:
Steiner concluded, "I expect continued strong performance in 2011 in our core business, despite expected headwinds from workforce wage increases, start-up costs associated
 
with new cost savings programs, our customer focused growth and information technology initiatives, and upgrades at our recently acquired waste-to-energy facility. The impact of these headwinds, however, should decline as we progress through 2011, and these investments will build a platform to accelerate earnings growth in the future."
 
The Company's definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and therefore not subject to comparison.
The quantitative reconciliations of each of the non-GAAP measures presented herein, other than projected earnings per diluted share, to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the accompanying schedules. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, and investors are urged to take into account GAAP measures as well as non-GAAP measures in evaluating the Company.
The Company's projected full year 2011 earnings of $2.24 to $2.30 per diluted share are not GAAP net earnings per diluted share and are anticipated to be adjusted to exclude the effects of events or circumstances in 2011 that management believes are not representative or indicative of our results of operations. Projected GAAP earnings per diluted share for the full year would require inclusion of the projected impact of future excluded items, including items that are not currently determinable, but may be significant, such as asset impairments and one-time items, charges, gains or losses from divestitures, resolution of income tax items or other items. Due to the uncertainty of the likelihood, amount and timing of any such items, we do not have information available to provide a quantitative reconciliation of adjusted projected full year earnings per diluted share to a GAAP earnings per diluted share projection.
The Company will host a conference call at 10:00 AM (Eastern) today to discuss the fourth quarter and full-year 2010 results. Information contained within this press release will be referenced and should be considered in conjunction with the call.
The conference call will be webcast live from the Investor Relations section of Waste Management's website www.wm.com.
