Waste Management Announces Third Quarter 2011 Earnings
Third Quarter Revenue Grows Nearly 9% and Net Income Increases More Than 11%
Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE: WM) today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2011. Net income for the quarter was $272 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, compared with $244 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2010. Revenues for the third quarter of 2011 were $3.52 billion compared with $3.24 billion for the same 2010 period, an increase of 8.9%.
HOUSTON  October 27, 2011 
(a)
The Company noted certain items that impacted the third quarter results for 2011 and 2010. Adjusting for these items, net income would have been $295 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2011 compared with $264 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2010.
(b)
Results in the third quarter of 2011 included a net decrease of $0.05 per diluted share from the following:
Results in the 2010 third quarter were adjusted for a net decrease of $0.04 per diluted share from the combined effects of charges related to remediation and closure costs at three closed landfills, the accounting effect of lower ten-year Treasury rates, and unfavorable income tax adjustments.
David P. Steiner, Chief Executive Officer of Waste Management, commented, "We are happy with our progress in the quarter, which resulted in expansion of both our revenue and net income year-over-year. Our revenue grew for the seventh consecutive quarter and our net income grew more than 11% year-over-year, primarily driven by our pricing programs, higher commodity prices and recycling volumes, acquisitions and fuel surcharges. In addition, we saw a $28 million benefit from our cost reduction initiatives."
The Company generated solid cash from operations, with $659 million of cash from operations in the quarter and $372 million in free cash flow. During the third quarter the Company returned $518 million to its shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.

Steiner continued, "The integration of Oakleaf into our company is progressing as expected. We are working with customers and the third-party hauler network to ensure a smooth transition that benefits customers, haulers, and Waste Management.
"Our internal revenue growth from yield for our collection and disposal operations was 1.6%, consistent with the results from the second quarter of 2011. Internal revenue growth from volume declined by 2.0% in the third quarter of 2011 from the prior year period. Excluding the volumes associated with the Gulf Coast clean-up efforts in 2010, internal revenue growth from volume only declined 0.3% in the quarter, which is the best performance we have seen in several years."
KEY HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER 2011
 
Steiner concluded, "We achieved our targets in the third quarter through cost controls and our continued pricing discipline, and we will remain focused on these priorities. We continue to expect full year adjusted earnings of between $2.14 and $2.18 per diluted share, and we expect our free cash flow to be about $1.25 billion for the year".
