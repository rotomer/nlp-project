HOUSTON
 February 16
(a)
 for the quarter was $266 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, compared with $281 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2010. Several items impacted results in the 2011 and 2010 fourth quarters. Excluding these items, net income would have been $289 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with $287 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2010, an increase in earnings per diluted share of 5% on an adjusted basis.
(b)
For the full year 2011, the Company reported revenues of $13.38 billion compared with $12.52 billion for 2010. Earnings per diluted share were $2.04 for the full year 2011 compared with $1.98 for the full year 2010. During fiscal years 2011 and 2010, several items impacted the full year results. On an as-adjusted basis taking those items into account, earnings per diluted share were $2.14 for the full year 2011 and $2.09 for the full year 2010.
(b)
As adjusted, results in the fourth quarter of 2011 excluded a negative $0.05 per diluted share consisting of the following:
 
 
David P. Steiner, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waste Management, commented, "We had a very good fourth quarter. Our core collection, landfill, and transfer station businesses performed well. We continued to see volumes improve sequentially and we had internal revenue growth from yield of 1.4%. We also saw accelerated improvement in our cost reduction initiatives.
"During 2011, we continued to produce strong cash flow and return cash to our shareholders. For the full year, our net cash provided by operating activities was $2.47 billion, we generated over $1.22 billion of adjusted free cash flow and we returned $1.21 billion to our shareholders."

2012 OUTLOOK
The Company announced the following with regard to its financial outlook for 2012:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Steiner concluded, "Based on our various assumptions for 2012, we forecast full-year adjusted earnings to be in the range of $2.22 to $2.30 per diluted share. With virtually all of our 2012 headwinds expected to occur in the first half of the year, earnings should be down year-over-year in the first quarter of 2012 but the rest of the year should show steadily increasing improvement. Capital expenditures are projected to be about $1.4 billion, and we expect the impact of bonus depreciation to be approximately a negative $200 million on free cash flow when compared to 2011. Consequently, our free cash flow for 2012 is estimated to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion.
(
b)
We expect to continue to use our free cash to pay our dividend and to repurchase shares, as well as to make appropriate investments in our business."
 
 
The Company's projected full year 2012 earnings of $2.22 to $2.30 per diluted share are not GAAP net earnings per diluted share and are anticipated to be adjusted to exclude the effects of events or circumstances in 2012 that are not representative or indicative of the Company's results of operations. Projected GAAP earnings per diluted share for the full year would require inclusion of the projected impact of future excluded items, including items that are not currently determinable, but may be significant, such as asset impairments and one-time items, charges, gains or losses from divestitures or litigation, or other items. Due to the uncertainty of the likelihood, amount and timing of any such items, the Company does not have information available to provide a quantitative reconciliation of adjusted projected full year earnings per diluted share to a GAAP earnings per diluted share projection.
The Company also discusses free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow and provides a projection of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure; because it believes that it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay our debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace "Net cash provided by operating activities," which is the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure. However, the Company believes free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how the Company views its liquidity. Nonetheless, the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that the Company has committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements. The Company defines free cash flow as:
 
 
 
The Company's definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and therefore is not subject to comparison.
The quantitative reconciliations of each of the non-GAAP measures presented herein, other than projected earnings per diluted share, to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the accompanying schedules. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, and investors are urged to take into account GAAP measures as well as non-GAAP measures in evaluating the Company.
The Company will host a conference call at 10:00 AM (Eastern) today to discuss the fourth quarter 2011 results. Information contained within this press release will be referenced and should be considered in conjunction with the call.
The conference call will be webcast live from the Investor Relations section of Waste Management's website .
