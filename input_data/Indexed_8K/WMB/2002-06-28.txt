Item 5. Other Events. In a Form 8-K filed on May 28, 2002, The Williams Companies, Inc. ("Williams") announced a plan that is designed to further improve the company's finances by more than $3 billion during the next 12 months and more narrowly focus its business strategy within its three major business units. Actions are expected to include issuing common stock, selling additional assets, increasing cash flow and making additional cuts in expenses. In the process of performing on its previously announced plan to sell a large amount of assets, Williams may sell certain assets at a loss, and it may be required to recognize impairments to the current recorded values of some assets even before they are sold as a result of information revealed in the process of investigating and preparing for such sales. Additionally, as a result of such asset sales, Williams may have reduced cash flow in the future. Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Williams has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. THE WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC. Date: June 28, 2002 /s/ Suzanne Costin --------------------------------------- Name: Suzanne Costin Title: Corporate Secretary
