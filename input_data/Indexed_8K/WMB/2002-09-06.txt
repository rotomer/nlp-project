WILLIAMS COMPLETES SALE OF COVE POINT LNG FACILITY HOUSTON - Williams (NYSE:WMB) announced today that it has completed the sale of its Cove Point liquefied natural gas facility and 87-mile pipeline to a subsidiary of Dominion Resources (NYSE:D). The transaction delivered cash proceeds of $217 million. The sale also eliminates the need for Williams to fund Cove Point's capital expenditure requirements of approximately $105 million over the next two years. "The Cove Point divestiture brings an immediate infusion of cash and represents another important step toward improving our financial strength and flexibility," says Doug Whisenant, president and CEO of Williams' gas pipeline unit. Once reactivated, the LNG facility will serve as another supply source for Williams' 10,500-mile Transco pipeline system that delivers natural gas from the Gulf Coast to markets in northeastern and southeastern states. ABOUT WILLIAMS (NYSE: WMB) Williams moves, manages and markets a variety of energy products, including natural gas, liquid hydrocarbons, petroleum and electricity.
