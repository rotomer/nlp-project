Steve Malcolm, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "We are getting things done to strengthen our finances. This is the third transaction we've announced over the past eight days related to asset sales that are already completed or in progress."

Williams is retaining its interest in the Aux Sable natural gas liquids plant, which processes all gas transported on the Alliance pipeline. Williams' subsidiaries wholly own and operate 20,400 miles of natural gas pipeline, comprised of the Transco, Northwest and Texas Gas systems.
