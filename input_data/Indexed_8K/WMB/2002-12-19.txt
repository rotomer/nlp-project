WILLIAMS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER TO RETIRE TULSA, Okla. -- Williams (NYSE:WMB) today announced that its chief financial officer Jack McCarthy, 59, will retire at year-end. McCarthy will provide the company with consulting services to assist in the transition of a few critical areas. He served the past 10 of his 16 years with Williams in the chief financial officer position. "Jack has made significant contributions to the company during his tenure and we wish him well in his retirement," said Steve Malcolm, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We are taking steps to ensure a smooth transition of this important role in our company." Williams expects in the first quarter to name its new chief financial officer. The company's selection process will identify and evaluate candidates both within Williams and outside. The company's controller and chief accounting officer Gary Belitz will be the interim successor to McCarthy. Belitz, 53, will continue in his current role as well as serve as acting chief financial officer. He joined Williams in 1985 and has served 10 years in his current position.

COMPANY CORRECTS STATEMENTS IN MEDIA REPORT TULSA, Okla. - Williams (NYSE:WMB) today corrected statements about stock-option loan forgiveness that were contained in a media report regarding the retirement of a company executive. The company's bylaws do not address the issue of stock-option loan forgiveness. Beginning Nov. 14, 2001, Williams ceased issuing stock-option loans to employees. The stock-option loan of Chief Financial Officer Jack McCarthy, whose year-end retirement was announced on Tuesday, is due on Dec. 31, 2005. As a matter of standard practice, the company has entered into a settlement and retention agreement with McCarthy under which he will receive a separation payment. The $847,000 payment, net of taxes, will be applied to McCarthy's outstanding stock-option loans. The company will file the agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission at a later date. Following retirement, McCarthy will provide consulting services to the company to transition a few critical areas. The company said it plans to name his successor in the first quarter. In the interim, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer Gary Belitz will add to his duties the role of acting chief financial officer.
