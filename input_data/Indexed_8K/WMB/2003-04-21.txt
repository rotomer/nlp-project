(d) From and after the Closing Date, upon any sale by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (excluding the Partnership Group) of any Common Units (including, without limitation, Common Units issued to Buyer or its Affiliates upon conversion of the Class B Common Units or the Subordinated Units) or of any Class B Common Units or upon the redemption by any of the Partnership Entities of any of the Common Units or Class B Common Units held by Buyer or its Affiliates (excluding the Partnership Group), Buyer shall pay to the Selling Parties an amount for each such Common Unit or Class B Common Unit sold or redeemed equal to 85% of the amount, if any, by which the proceeds received by the Buyer or its -6-
Affiliates (net of any underwriting commissions, placement fees or other offering expenses payable by the Buyer or its Affiliates) exceeds $37.50 per Common Unit or Class B Common Unit (the aggregate amounts, if any, payable to the Selling Parties pursuant to this Section 1.3(d), the "THIRD PAYMENT"); provided, however, that this Section 1.3(d) shall apply only with respect to the first 5,000,000 units (whether Common Units or Class B Common Units or any combination thereof) held by Buyer or its Affiliates (excluding the Partnership Group) which are sold or redeemed; provided, further, that the maximum amount payable to the Selling Parties pursuant to this Section 1.3(d) shall in no event exceed $20 million.

Buyer shall pay any amounts due to the Selling Parties pursuant to this Section 1.3(d) no later than the third business day following the closing date of any such sale or redemption. For so long as the Selling Parties are entitled to receive payments pursuant to this Section 1.3(d), Buyer agrees that it shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates (excluding the Partnership Group) to, sell, convey, assign or otherwise dispose of any Common Units or Class B Common Units for consideration other than cash. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 1.3(d) shall not in any way obligate Buyer or any of its Affiliates (i) to sell any Common Units or Class B Common Units or give rise to any optional or mandatory redemption rights or obligations with respect to the Common Units or the Class B Common Units or (ii) to make any payments to the Selling Parties to the extent not permitted under any definitive debt financing documents entered into pursuant to the debt financing commitment letter described in Section 3.5. (e) Buyer shall assume at the Closing the obligations, and make the applicable payments from time to time, as specified in accordance with Section 8.2(c) hereof (the "FOURTH PAYMENT"). (f) If the Closing Price (as defined in Section 9.16) of the Common Units as of three business days prior to Closing is less than $32.00 per unit, then the First Payment shall be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between $32.00 and such Closing Price multiplied by 14,590,312.

their agents, including legal representatives, accountants and environmental and engineering consultants (provided that the Selling Parties or their designee(s) may, in the sole discretion of the Selling Parties, accompany the person(s) to whom such access is provided as contemplated herein) and, during such period, shall furnish promptly to Buyer all information concerning the business, properties, liabilities and personnel of any of the Partnership Entities as Buyer may request, provided that no investigation or receipt of information pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall affect any representation or warranty of the Selling Parties or Buyer's reliance thereon. Additionally, Buyer shall hold in confidence all such information on the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 9.16). Buyer shall have no right of access to, and the Selling Parties shall have no obligation to provide to Buyer, (1) bids received from other Persons in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and information and analysis (including financial analysis) relating to such bids or (2) any information the disclosure of which the Selling Parties have concluded may jeopardize any privilege available to the Selling Parties or any of the Partnership Entities relating to such information or would cause any of such entities to breach a confidentiality obligation. Buyer agrees that if Buyer or its authorized representatives receive, or if the information (whether in electronic mail format, on computer hard drives or otherwise) held by any of the Partnership Entities as of the Closing includes information that relates to the business operations or other strategic matters of the Parent or any of the Selling Parties or any of their Affiliates (other than the Partnership Entities) such information shall be held in confidence on the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, but the term of the restriction on the disclosure and use of such information shall continue in effect as to such information for a period of two years from the Closing. Buyer further agrees that if any of the Selling Parties or Partnership Entities inadvertently furnishes to Buyer copies of or access to information that is subject to clause (2) of the second preceding sentence, Buyer will, upon the Selling Parties' request, promptly return the same to the Selling Parties together with any and all extracts therefrom or notes pertaining thereto (whether in electronic or other format). Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Selling Parties and their Affiliates from and against any "LOSSES" (as defined in Section 8.2) asserted against or suffered by the Seller Indemnified Parties (as defined in Section 8.2) relating to, resulting from, or arising out of any personal injury to, or property damage directly caused by, any Buyer Representative during any site visit, examination or investigation conducted in accordance with this Section 4.2(a), except where such personal injury or property damage results from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Selling Parties, Parent, the Partnership Entities or any employee or agent thereof. (b) Buyer agrees that it shall preserve and keep all books and records relating to the business or operations of the Partnership Entities on or before the Closing Date in Buyer's possession for a period of at least six years from the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer agrees that it shall preserve and keep all books and records of the Partnership Entities relating to any audit or investigation instituted by a Governmental Authority or any litigation (whether or not existing on the Closing Date) if it is reasonably likely that such investigation or litigation may relate to matters occurring prior to the Closing, without regard to the six-year period set forth in this Section 4.2(b). -28-
SECTION 4.3. EMPLOYEE MATTERS. (a) Buyer intends to offer, or cause an Affiliate to offer, employment to substantially all Business Employees who are identified on Schedule 2.19(f)(i) as full-time Business Employees and may offer employment to such Business Employees who are identified as less than full-time as it may choose, based on the recommendation of the key management of the Partnership Entities, in either case, on terms and conditions for each Business Employee as are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to industry standards for similarly situated employees located in the same geographic region, as determined in good faith by Buyer, such employment to commence as contemplated in accordance with the Transition Services Agreement. In addition, within fifteen (15) days after the execution of this Agreement, representatives of Buyer and the Selling Parties shall meet to identify employees of the Selling Parties or any of their Affiliates who are not Business Employees and to whom Buyer and the Selling Parties agree that Buyer may make offers of employment (collectively, the "ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEES"). The Selling Parties agree that if any of the Additional Employees are covered by employee benefit plans or programs of Parent or any of its Affiliates other than Seller Plans, the Selling Parties shall provide Buyer with copies of such plans or programs as promptly as practicable after such Additional Employees are identified. Any such offers of employment made by the Buyer to an Additional Employee shall be on at least the same basis as the offers Buyer makes to Business Employees. Promptly following such agreement regarding the Additional Employees, the Selling Parties shall prepare and submit to Buyer a list of the Additional Employees. Buyer or one or more of its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Selling Parties of the names of those Business Employees and Additional Employees that accept such employment offers from Buyer or any other Affiliate of Buyer prior to the Closing Date and in no event more than fifteen (15) days after the Closing Date. The Selling Parties and their Affiliates shall not discourage any Business Employee or Additional Employee to whom an offer of employment is made by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer from accepting such offer. Business Employees and Additional Employees who accept employment from Buyer and become employees of Buyer or an Affiliate thereof in accordance with the Transition Services Agreement are referred to herein as "TRANSFERRED EMPLOYEES." (b) Business Employees who are covered by the PACE Collective Bargaining Agreement are identified on Schedule 2.19(g)(i) (the "REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES"). At the time the first Represented Employee becomes a Transferred Employee (the "REPRESENTED EMPLOYEE TRANSFER DATE"), Buyer agrees to (i) comply with all legal requirements that may be applicable as a result of the Transferred Employees who are Represented Employees being represented by any labor organization, (ii) recognize PACE as the exclusive bargaining unit for the Transferred Employees who are Represented Employees and (iii) assume (and otherwise adopt) all rights and obligations of the Selling Parties under the PACE Collective Bargaining Agreement with respect to Transferred Employees who are Represented Employees. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall offer employment, commencing in accordance with the Transition Services Agreement, to all Represented Employees. (c) Effective as of the Represented Employee Transfer Date, Buyer shall assume the Williams Pipe Line Company Pension Plan for Hourly Employees (the "PENSION PLAN"). On or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Selling Parties or their applicable Affiliate shall cause the assets of the Pension Plan held under the current master trust to be transferred to a -29-
trust established or maintained by the Buyer or one of its Affiliates. Such transfer shall be made within one business day after any valuation date of the current master trust and shall be made in cash, marketable securities or other property acceptable to Buyer. Prior to such transfer of assets, the Selling Parties shall make a contribution to the Pension Plan in an amount necessary to cause the accrued benefit obligations under FASB 87 with respect to the Pension Plan to be fully funded as of the last day of the month immediately preceding the month that includes the Represented Employee Transfer Date using actuarial assumptions and factors used for FASB 87 reporting purposes in the year that includes the Represented Employee Transfer Date, which contribution shall also include the amount necessary to satisfy in full the minimum funding contribution liability for the 2002 plan year and the estimated minimum funding contribution liability for the 2003 plan year, as prorated for the partial 2003 plan year through Represented Employee Transfer Date, whether or not such 2002 and 2003 plan year funding contributions are then due. (d) The Selling Parties' shall retain the obligation for providing retiree medical and retiree life benefits to all employees and former employees (including their eligible dependents and beneficiaries) of the Selling Parties and their Affiliates other than Transferred Employees. On or as soon as practicable after the Represented Employee Transfer Date, the Selling Parties shall transfer to Buyer sponsorship of the Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association ("VEBA") trust established or maintained for the Represented Employees' retiree medical, including all assets of such trust. (e) The Selling Parties' shall retain the obligation for providing long-term disability benefits to (i) those Represented Employees who, immediately prior to the Represented Employee Transfer Date, are receiving benefits under The Williams Companies, Inc. Long-Term Disability Plan (but the parties hereto agree that such retained obligation shall not include the obligation under the Pension Plan in respect of such totally disabled persons to continue to accrue benefits, which obligation is to be assumed by Buyer as of the Represented Employee Transfer Date under Section 4.3(c) above) and (ii) those Represented Employees who become totally disabled on or after the Represented Employee Transfer Date as a result of an injury or illness occurring prior to the Represented Employee Transfer Date. (f) Transferred Employees shall participate in employee benefit plans and programs of the Buyer, which shall provide benefits that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to industry standards for similarly situated employees located in the same geographic region, as determined in good faith by Buyer, and that, subject to the terms of the PACE Collective Bargaining Agreement and Section 4.3(r), shall cover each Transferred Employee effective as of the date each such employee becomes a Transferred Employee (each such date, an "EMPLOYEE TRANSFER DATE"). (g) Each Transferred Employee shall, without duplication of benefits, be given credit for all service with Selling Parties or their Affiliates prior to the Employee Transfer Date, using the same methodology used by such parties as of immediately prior to such date for crediting service and determining levels of benefits under the Seller Plans, (i) under all employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements maintained by or contributed to by the Buyer in which a Transferred Employee becomes a participant for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and determination of level of benefits (excluding, however, benefit accrual under any defined -30-
benefit plans), and (ii) for purposes of calculating the amount of each Transferred Employee's severance benefits, if any. (h) With respect to the plan year during which an Employee Transfer Date occurs, Buyer will (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Transferred Employees under any medical, dental and life insurance benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to participate in after his or her Employee Transfer Date, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such employee and that have not been satisfied as of his or her Employee Transfer Date under any welfare plan maintained for the Transferred Employee immediately prior to his or her Employee Transfer Date, and (ii) provide each Transferred Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to his or her Employee Transfer Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans that such employee is eligible to participate in after his or her Employee Transfer Date. (i) Effective as of each Employee Transfer Date, each Transferred Employee shall become fully vested in his or her account balances in any defined contribution or 401(k) Plan maintained by the Selling Parties or their Affiliates on behalf of such Transferred Employee (the "SELLER SAVINGS PLAN") and distributions of such account balances shall be made available to each such Transferred Employee as soon as practicable following his or her Employee Transfer Date, in accordance with the provisions of the Seller Savings Plan and applicable law. Participants shall be permitted to elect rollovers of such accounts (excluding after-tax amounts) in cash to a defined contribution or 401(k) Plan maintained by Buyer (the "BUYER SAVINGS PLAN"). Pending such distribution or rollover, the Seller Savings Plan shall permit each Transferred Employee with a loan outstanding under the Seller Savings Plan to continue to be able to repay such loan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if requested by Buyer and at Buyer's sole cost, the Selling Parties shall cause a spinoff of the accounts of the Transferred Employees to a Buyer 401(k) plan on such terms as reasonably requested by Buyer. (j) As of the occurrence of the first Employee Transfer Date, Buyer shall have in effect flexible spending reimbursement accounts under a cafeteria plan qualifying under Section 125 of the Code (the "BUYER 125 PLAN") that provides benefits to the Transferred Employees that are substantially identical in all material respects to those provided by the flexible spending reimbursement accounts under the cafeteria plan in which the Transferred Employees are eligible to participate immediately prior to such date (the "SELLER 125 PLAN"). Buyer agrees to cause the Buyer 125 Plan to accept a spin-off of the flexible spending reimbursement accounts from the Seller 125 Plan and to honor and continue through the end of the calendar year in which an Employee Transfer Date occurs the elections made by each Transferred Employee under the Seller 125 Plan in respect of the flexible spending reimbursement accounts that are in effect immediately prior to the Employee Transfer Date. As soon as practicable following an Employee Transfer Date, the Selling Parties shall cause to be transferred to Buyer an amount in cash equal to the excess of the aggregate accumulated contributions to the flexible spending reimbursement accounts made during the year in which an Employee Transfer Date occurs by the applicable Transferred Employee over the aggregate reimbursement payouts made for such year from such accounts to such Transferred Employee. If the aggregate reimbursement payouts from the flexible reimbursement accounts made during -31-
the year in which an Employee Transfer Date occurs made to the applicable Transferred Employee exceed the aggregate accumulated contributions to such accounts for such year by the applicable Transferred Employee, Buyer shall cause such excess to be transferred to the Selling Parties as soon as practicable following the applicable Employee Transfer Date. On and after an Employee Transfer Date, Buyer shall assume and be solely responsible for all claims by the applicable Transferred Employee under the Seller 125 Plan, whether incurred prior to, on or after the applicable Employee Transfer Date, that have not been paid in full as of the applicable Employee Transfer Date. (k) Buyer and the Selling Parties agree to cooperate as necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 4.3 and to ensure an orderly transition of benefits coverage with respect to the Transferred Employees from the Seller Plans to Buyer's plans. (l) Buyer shall assume all paid-time-off obligations of the Selling Parties and their Affiliates with respect to each Transferred Employee, and each Transferred Employee shall, without duplication of benefits, be given credit for all accrued but unused paid-time-off under Selling Parties or their Affiliate's paid-time-off program as of such Transferred Employee's Employee Transfer Date, using the same methodology used by the Selling Parties or their Affiliates immediately prior to such Employee Transfer Date for crediting service and determining the amount of such paid-time-off benefits. Buyer shall also assume the full obligation to pay all or any portion of any bonus or incentive plan benefit for the years 2002 and 2003, to the extent unpaid as of an Employee Transfer Date, with respect to any Transferred Employee; provided, however, the Selling Parties will promptly reimburse Buyer for (i) any portion of any bonus paid after the applicable Employee Transfer Date for the year 2002, to the extent that the bonus so paid does not exceed the unpaid portion of the bonus declared for such period in respect of such Transferred Employee and (ii) for the allocable portion of any bonus paid after the applicable Employee Transfer Date for the year 2003 to the extent such bonus is included in general and administrative expenses of the Partnership and not in operating and maintenance expenses, such allocable portion to be equal to the product of (A) a fraction, of which (I) the numerator is the number of days in the period from and including January 1, 2003 to but excluding the Closing Date, and (II) the denominator is 365, times (B) the amount of such bonus included in general and administrative expenses of the Partnership that is so paid for the year 2003 to such Transferred Employee, provided, that in no event shall the amount used in this subclause (B) exceed the 2003 target bonus amount established by Parent for such Transferred Employee. (m) If Buyer terminates the employment of a Transferred Employee at any time between his or her Employee Transfer Date and the first anniversary of such date for a reason other than cause, but excluding any termination in which such employee is offered substantially comparable continued employment by another Person, Buyer shall provide such Transferred Employee who is not a Represented Employee with a severance benefit equal to the greater of (i) the benefit provided under Buyer's severance plan or program and (ii) a sum equal to two weeks of pay for every year of service with a minimum of six weeks and a maximum of fifty-two weeks total severance benefit. -32-
(n) For a period of one year after the Closing Date: (i) except as contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, (A) induce any employee of any of the Selling Parties or their Affiliates (other than the Transferred Employees) to leave the employ of any such Selling Party or Affiliate thereof or (B) employ or otherwise engage as an employee, independent contractor or otherwise any such employee, except that Buyer and its Affiliates shall not be precluded from hiring any such employee who (y) initiates discussions regarding such employment without any direct or indirect solicitation by Buyer or its Affiliates or (z) responds to any public advertisement placed by Buyer or its Affiliates; and (ii) neither the Selling Parties nor any of their Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, (A) induce any of the Transferred Employees to leave the employ of any Partnership Entity or Buyer or any of its Affiliates or (B) employ or otherwise engage as an employee, independent contractor or otherwise any such Transferred Employee, except that the Selling Parties and their Affiliates shall not be precluded from hiring any such employee who (y) initiates discussions regarding such employment without any direct or indirect solicitation by the Selling Parties or their Affiliates or (z) responds to any public advertisement placed by the Selling Parties or their Affiliates. (o) Effective as of each Employee Transfer Date, the applicable Transferred Employee who is not a Represented Employee shall become fully vested in his or her accrued benefits under The Williams Companies, Inc. Pension Plan maintained by the Selling Parties or their Affiliates. (p) The Selling Parties shall bear the full and sole responsibility and liability for providing any notice to the Selling Parties' or Parent's employees which may be required pursuant to the Federal Working Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 ("WARN") or any similar applicable law for any employment loss which occurs in connection with this transaction and shall hold Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Partnership Entities) harmless from and against any and all losses associated with or related to the Selling Parties failure to comply with WARN or any similar law with respect to such employees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that WARN liability on the part of the Selling Parties or Parent is triggered with respect to a Business Employee due to Buyer or one or more of its Affiliates terminating the employment of one or more Transferred Employees after the applicable Employee Transfer Date, then any WARN liability that otherwise would be attributed to the Selling Parties or Parent with respect to a Business Employee shall instead be the sole responsibility of the Buyer. (q) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Partnership Entities) are not assuming any obligation or liability of the Selling Parties or any of their Affiliates, including any Seller Plan, or any liability thereunder, to any Transferred Employee or other Person except to the extent such liability or obligation is specifically assumed pursuant to this Section 4.3. -33-
(r) Nothing in this Section 4.3 shall prevent Buyer or an Affiliate thereof from amending or terminating, in its sole discretion, any employee benefit plan of Buyer or an Affiliate thereof at any time following the Closing, subject to the provisions of the PACE Collective Bargaining Agreement and Section 4.3(m) above; provided, however, that Buyer agrees to indemnify and protect the Seller Indemnified Parties for any liability they may have as a result of amending or terminating any employee benefit plan of Buyer or an Affiliate thereof following the Closing. SECTION 4.4. CONSENTS AND APPROVALS. (a) On or as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the Selling Parties shall cause Parent to deliver notice (a copy of which will be furnished to Buyer) to the Federal Trade Commission, as required under that certain order, dated June 17, 1998, to which Parent is subject (the "CONSENT DECREE"). The Selling Parties and Buyer shall each use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and in the case of the Selling Parties, cause Parent and the Partnership Entities to obtain, all necessary consents, waivers, authorizations and approvals of all Governmental Authorities and of all other Persons required in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by such party of this Agreement and will cooperate fully with the other party in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders, and approvals, giving such notices, and making such filings. If the parties agree that a filing is required, each party shall (i) file or cause to be filed, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within five (5) business days after the execution and delivery of this Agreement), with the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice, all reports and other documents required to be filed by such party under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR ACT") concerning the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) promptly comply with or cause to be complied with any requests by the Federal Trade Commission or the United States Department of Justice for additional information concerning such transactions, in each case so that the waiting period applicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act shall expire as soon as practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Each party agrees to request, and to cooperate with the other party in requesting, early termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. The costs of any filing fees required in connection with any HSR filing shall be borne equally between Buyer, on the on hand, and the Selling Parties, on the other hand; provided, however, that any and all costs and expenses otherwise incurred by any of the parties in connection with obtaining any necessary consents, waivers, authorizations and approvals hereunder shall be borne solely by the party required to obtain or deliver such consents, waivers, authorizations and approvals; provided, further, any and all costs and expenses incurred by any of the parties in connection with obtaining the waivers, consents and amendments referred to in Section 5.13 hereunder shall be borne by the Selling Parties. (b) Without limiting the generality of the parties' undertakings pursuant to Section 4.6, the parties shall: (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the entry in a judicial or administrative proceeding brought under any antitrust law by the Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of Justice or any other party of a permanent or preliminary injunction or other order that would make consummation of the -34-
transactions contemplated by this Agreement unlawful or that would prevent or delay such consummation; (ii) take promptly, in the event that such an injunction or order has been issued in such a proceeding, any and all reasonable steps, including the appeal thereof and the posting of a bond necessary to vacate, modify, or suspend such injunction or order, so as to permit such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) not take a position or agree to a settlement that will or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Buyer or a material adverse effect on the Selling Parties or otherwise prejudice the Buyer's or the Selling Parties' intent with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. (c) If the transfer of any instrument, contract, license, lease, permit, or other document to Buyer hereunder shall require the consent of any party thereto other than the Selling Parties, Parent or the Old Company, then this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign the same, and such item shall not be assigned to or assumed by Buyer, if an actual or attempted assignment thereof would constitute a breach thereof or default thereunder. In such case, the parties shall cooperate and each shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consents of such other parties to the extent required and, if and when any such consents are obtained, to transfer the applicable instrument, contract, license, lease, permit, or other document. If any such consent cannot be obtained, the Selling Parties shall cooperate in any reasonable arrangement designed to obtain for Buyer all benefits, privileges and obligations of the applicable instrument, contract, license, lease, permit, or document, including, without limitation, possession, use, risk of loss, potential for gain and dominion, control and demand. (d) During the term of this Agreement and prior to the Closing, Buyer will negotiate in good faith and use its commercially reasonable efforts to finalize the terms and conditions of the debt financing described in Section 3.5, including without limitation, the execution and delivery of definitive agreements for same containing terms and conditions to funding that are consistent in all material respects with the commitment therefor referenced in Section 3.5, so that Buyer will have the immediately available funds to pay the First Payment of the Purchase Price at Closing; provided, however, Buyer (or its Affiliates) shall not be required to make any representation in such definitive agreements relating to the Partnership Entities that it is not true. Buyer will notify the Selling Parties, upon request, of the status of the negotiations for the debt financing described in Section 3.5. SECTION 4.5. FURTHER ASSURANCES. Upon the request of Buyer at any time on or after the Closing Date, each of the Selling Parties will promptly execute and deliver, or cause Parent to execute and deliver, such further instruments of assignment, transfer, conveyance, endorsement, direction or authorization and other documents as Buyer or its counsel may reasonably request in order to perfect title of Buyer and its successors and assigns to the Securities or otherwise to effectuate the purposes of this Agreement. -35-
SECTION 4.6. COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto will use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable consistent with applicable law to consummate and make effective in the most expeditious manner practicable the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon the reasonable request of Buyer from time to time, the Selling Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in meeting the condition referred to in Section 5.9. SECTION 4.7. NOTICE OF BREACH. Each party shall promptly give to the other parties written notice with particularity upon having knowledge of any matter that would constitute a breach by such party of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant of such party contained in this Agreement, including, without limitation, the Selling Parties' representations in Article II. The Selling Parties shall have the obligation prior to the Closing to supplement the Disclosure Schedule in a prompt manner with respect to any matter that would have been required to be set forth on or described in such Disclosure Schedule (a "DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE UPDATE"). Any such supplemental disclosure (i) will not be deemed to have been disclosed as of the date of this Agreement for purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in Article V have been satisfied (unless such supplemental disclosure relates to an update made in response to Section 2.21(a)(vii)), and (ii) shall not be deemed to have cured any breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement relating to the matters set forth in such update for purposes of indemnification pursuant to Article VIII, unless such supplemental disclosure relates to an update to Schedule 2.25 hereto by reason of an action taken by a customer or shipper after the date hereof, in which case a breach of the representation in Section 2.25 shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of indemnification pursuant to Article VIII. SECTION 4.8. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. (a) For two (2) years after the Closing, the Selling Parties and their Affiliates shall not, directly or indirectly, disclose to any Person any information not in the public domain or generally known in the industry, in any form, whether acquired prior to or after the Closing Date, relating to the business and operations of the Partnership Entities; provided, however, that any such confidential information received, obtained or created in the course of defending any claim or action under Article VIII hereof shall not be disclosed for a period of two (2) years following the resolution of such claim or action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Selling Parties may disclose any information relating to the business and operations of the Partnership Entities (i) if required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, and (ii) to such other Persons if, at the time such information is provided, such Person is already in the possession of such information. (b) Except as consented to by Buyer in writing, none of the Selling Parties and their Affiliates shall release any Person from any Bidder Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below) now existing with respect to the Securities or Partnership Entities or waive or amend any provision thereof. After the Closing Date, the Selling Parties shall use commercially reasonable -36-
efforts to have all confidential information either returned to the Selling Parties or destroyed. Furthermore, if any parties to the Bidder Confidentiality Agreements breach the terms of their respective agreement, upon the request of Buyer, the Selling Parties and Parent shall cooperate with Buyer to enforce the terms of such Bidder Confidentiality Agreements at Buyer's cost and expense. The term "BIDDER CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS" shall mean the confidentiality agreements between any of Parent, the Selling Parties or any of their Affiliates or advisors and prospective purchasers (other than Buyer or its Affiliates) of the Securities. SECTION 4.9. TAX COVENANTS. (a) The Selling Parties shall cause the Partnership Entities to prepare and file all Tax Returns relating to any of the Partnership Entities with the appropriate federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies and cause the Partnership Entities to pay the Taxes shown to be due thereon, for which Tax Returns are due and Taxes are payable prior to the Closing Date. For periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, but for which Tax Returns are not due and Taxes are not payable as of the Closing Date, (i) the Selling Parties shall prepare and submit to Buyer for review, signature, and filing all such Tax Returns required to be filed by the New Company, and, at such time, the Selling Parties shall pay to the Buyer the Taxes shown to be due thereon, and (ii) the Buyer shall cause the Partnership Entities (other than the New Company) to prepare and file all Tax Returns and cause the Partnership Entities to pay the Taxes shown to be due thereon. (b) Buyer shall cause the Partnership Entities to prepare all Tax Returns relating to the Partnership Entities for periods beginning on or before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date. With respect to any such Tax Return relating to the New Company, Buyer shall determine (by an interim closing of the books as of the Closing Date except for ad valorem and property taxes owed or owing by the New Company, which shall be prorated on a daily basis) the Tax that would have been due with respect to the period covered by such Tax Return if such taxable period ended on and included the Closing Date (the "PRE-CLOSING TAX"). Not later than 30 days prior to the due date of each such Tax Return, Buyer shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return to the Selling Parties together with a statement of the excess, if any, of the Pre-Closing Tax over the amount set up as a liability for such Tax on the financial statements of the New Company. Buyer shall make or cause to be made such changes in such Tax Returns or the statement of excess, if any, as the Selling Parties may reasonably request, which changes shall be subject to Buyer's approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Not later than five days prior to the due date of such Tax Return, the Selling Parties shall pay to Buyer the amount of such excess. Upon receipt thereof, Buyer shall file or cause to be filed such Tax Return and shall pay all Taxes shown to be due thereon. (c) The Selling Parties will cause any tax sharing agreement or similar arrangement with respect to Taxes involving any of the Partnership Entities to be terminated effective as of the Closing Date, to the extent any such agreement or arrangement relates to any such entity, and after the Closing Date none of the Partnership Entities shall have any obligation under any such agreement or arrangement for any past, present or future period. (d) All excise, sales, use, transfer (including real property transfer or gains), stamp, documentary, filing, recordation and other similar taxes, together with any interest, -37-
additions or penalties with respect thereto and any interest in respect of such additions or penalties, resulting directly from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "TRANSFER TAXES"), shall be borne by the Selling Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.9, any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and filed when due by the party primarily or customarily responsible under the applicable local law for filing such Tax Returns, and such party will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the other party at least ten days prior to the due date for such Tax Returns. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any franchise Tax paid or payable with respect to any of the Partnership Entities shall be allocated to the taxable period during which the right to do business is obtained by the payment of the franchise Tax. SECTION 4.10. INSURANCE, BONDS AND COLLATERAL. (a) Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause the Partnership Entities to take, such actions as may be necessary or appropriate so that all surety bonds, letters of credit, and cash collateral issued in respect of any of the Partnership Entities and listed on Schedule 4.10(a) (collectively, the "BONDS") are replaced as soon as practicable and in no event later than 60 days after the Closing Date. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Selling Parties and their Affiliates for any and all Losses (in each case without deduction or set off) incurred on account of such Bonds after the Closing Date. (b) Notwithstanding the termination of coverage on the Closing Date (or May 1, 2003, in the case of excess liability policies of the Parent Policies) for each of the Partnership Entities under the Parent Policies described in Section 2.20(b), the Selling Parties shall take or cause the Parent to take appropriate action to ensure that upon and after the Closing (i) each of the Partnership Entities shall continue to be covered by such Parent Policies for claims relating to or arising from events or occurrences happening prior to such termination of coverage and, with respect to "claims made" policies, which are reported prior to such termination of coverage, to the same extent as each such entity was covered prior to Closing under each of such Parent Policies, and (ii) each of the Partnership Entities is named as an insured or additional insured party under such Parent Policies in respect of such claims. After the Closing Date, the Selling Parties or Parent shall continue to manage the claims described in the immediately preceding sentence and shall be responsible for all costs on account of such claims, including but not limited to deductibles and retention and third-party administration charges. For a period of five years after the Closing Date, the Selling Parties shall provide or cause Parent to provide the Buyer, as reasonably requested by the Buyer, historical insurance carrier loss-runs and internally administered loss-runs in respect of the Partnership Entities. (c) Without limiting the generality of Section 4.10(b), after the Closing Date, Parent or its Affiliates (other than the Partnership Entities) shall continue to manage all workers' compensation claims of all Transferred Employees that are known and reported on or prior to the Closing Date, or that are covered under the workers compensation policy provided by the Parent. The Selling Parties shall be responsible for all costs on account of such claims, including but not limited to deductibles and third party administrator charges. -38-
SECTION 4.11. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. (a) ATLAS Contribution and License Back Agreement. The Selling Parties shall, or shall cause one or more of their Affiliates to, assign and transfer, at or immediately prior to Closing, all right, title and interest to the ATLAS 2000 System, any additional software related thereto and any computer hardware associated therewith to the Partnership Entity or Partnership Entities, as the case may be, designated by the Buyer pursuant to an Assignment, Contribution and License Agreement, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 1.2(a)(iv)(3) (the "ATLAS ASSIGNMENT, CONTRIBUTION AND LICENSE AGREEMENT"). The ATLAS Assignment, Contribution and License Agreement shall provide for, among other things, Buyer to cause the applicable Partnership Entity or Entities to grant WES a license, which WES may sublicense to Williams Bio-Energy LLC, to use, copy, modify, enhance and upgrade the ATLAS 2000 System to support any business owned or operated by Williams Bio-Energy LLC for so long as Williams Bio-Energy LLC continues to use the ATLAS 2000 System. (b) IT Migration Team and Migration Assets. The parties shall each designate up to three (3) representatives to a migration team ("IT MIGRATION TEAM") that shall be responsible for determining the software and computer hardware ("IT ASSETS") that will be necessary for Buyer to continue operations of the Partnership Entities in substantially as efficient a manner in which such operations are conducted by the Partnership Entities as of the Closing Date, taking into account, as appropriate, the impact on such items as may be necessary in light of the reduced size and scale of Buyer and the Partnership Entities immediately after the Closing as compared to the size and scale (and corresponding needs) of Parent and its Affiliates (including the Partnership Entities) immediately before the Closing. The IT Migration Team shall identify (i) those certain IT Assets to be transferred or assigned to the Partnership Entities by the Selling Parties or their Affiliates (which IT Assets shall include, subject to the approval of the Partnership Entities, all computer hardware that is not wholly owned by any of the Partnership Entities, but that is owned by Parent or any of its Affiliates, and that is (A) not required for the on-going business of Parent and its subsidiaries (other than the Partnership Entities) and (B) is used more than 50% of the time or for the benefit of Transferred Employees) (the "TRANSFERRED ASSETS") and (ii) those certain IT Assets to be purchased, leased or licensed by or for the benefit of the Partnership Entities as a substitute for IT Assets retained by the Selling Parties or their Affiliates, subject to the parameters set forth in the immediately preceding sentence (the "SUBSTITUTED ASSETS," and collectively with Transferred Assets, the "MIGRATION ASSETS"); provided, however, the Selling Parties shall retain the sole discretion as to whether any IT Asset owned, licensed or leased by the Selling Parties or their Affiliates is transferred or assigned to the Partnership Entities as a Transferred Asset, including without limitation the IT Assets listed on Schedule 2.13(b). (c) Dispute Resolution. If the Selling Parties and Buyer are unable to agree as to whether one or more IT Assets are to be included among the Substituted Assets (or the terms of the purchase, lease or license of such assets), the parties will compile a list of such disputed IT Assets (the "Dispute List"). The Dispute List will, in the case of each category of disputed IT Asset, set forth the Selling Parties' choice and Buyer's choice of IT Asset to be deemed a Substituted Asset and the terms of the purchase, lease or license of such assets. The parties will refer the dispute to a technology consultant of nationally recognized standing (the "TECHNOLOGY CONSULTANT") to be selected in the following manner: the Selling Parties will select three (3) -39-
candidates and deliver a written notice containing the names of such candidates to Buyer, and within five (5) days of receiving such notice, Buyer will select one of such three candidates to serve as the Technology Consultant. The Technology Consultant may not be otherwise engaged by the Selling Parties or Buyer, or their respective Affiliates, in connection with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and the Transaction Documents and shall not have performed any material services on behalf of the Selling Parties or Buyer, or their respective Affiliates, during the five (5) years immediately preceding the date of this Agreement. Upon selection, the Technology Consultant shall immediately be engaged by the parties, with costs and expenses of the Technology Consultant to be borne equally be the Selling Parties, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand. For a period of ten (10) days following the engagement of the Technology Consultant, the Selling Parties and Buyer shall be entitled to furnish the Technology Consultant with such supporting documentation as they deem reasonable to support their respective positions with respect any or all of the IT Assets on the Dispute List. The Technology Consultant shall resolve the dispute, with respect to each category of disputed IT Asset on the Dispute List, by choosing either the Selling Parties' or Buyer's choice of IT Asset (and either Selling Parties' or Buyers' terms of the purchase, lease or license of such assets), and the decision of the Technology Consultant shall be final and binding on the Selling Parties and Buyer. The Technology Consultant shall resolve the dispute with respect to each category of IT Asset on the Dispute List within thirty (30) days after the engagement of the Technology Consultant. (d) IT Migration Plan. The IT Migration Team shall also be responsible for developing a detailed plan that will include timetables for and estimated costs of the transfer, assignment, purchase, lease or license, as the case may be, of the Migration Assets (the "IT MIGRATION PLAN"). The IT Migration Plan shall provide, among other things, that if requested by Buyer, the Selling Parties or their Affiliates will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain for Buyer, on commercially reasonable terms, such Substituted Assets as requested, subject to Section 4.11(c) above. The Migration Team shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the development of the IT Migration Plan prior to the Closing Date and, in any event, shall complete the IT Migration Plan by no later than fifteen (15) days after the Closing Date. The time from such date through completion of the implementation of the IT Migration Plan shall be stated therein and shall be referred to as the "IT MIGRATION PERIOD." It is understood by the parties hereto that the IT Migration Plan will be subject to mutual revision, agreement for which shall not be unreasonably withheld by either party, during the IT Migration Period. Upon completion of the IT Migration Plan, the Selling Parties shall promptly thereafter transfer the Transferred Assets to Buyer, or the Partnership Entities designated by Buyer. (e) Costs. (i) Costs Relating to Preparation of IT Migration Plan. All costs related to the Selling Parties' and their Affiliates' employees and contractors involved in the preparation of the IT Migration Plan shall be borne by the Selling Parties, and all costs related to Buyer's employees and contractors involved in the preparation of the IT Migration Plan shall be borne by Buyer. Costs incurred by Buyer pursuant to this Section 4.11(e)(i) shall not be subject to the Expense Limit (as defined in Section 4.15). -40-
(ii) Costs Relating to Implementation of IT Migration Plan. All costs related to the implementation of the IT Migration Plan, including without limitation the transfer and assignment of Transferred Assets and purchase, lease or license of Substituted Assets, as the case may be (and including the cost of time, labor and expenses of employees of the Selling Parties and their Affiliates in connection therewith) (collectively, "IMPLEMENTATION COSTS"), shall be borne by the Buyer, subject in the case of this Section 4.11(e)(ii) to the Expense Limit. The Implementation Costs also shall include, without limitation, the following costs and expenses: (i) all cost associated with the transfer of leases or licenses relating to Transferred Assets, (ii) any excess costs or fees associated with any of the Selling Parties or their Affiliates being deemed to be a service bureau by a vendor of such Migration Assets, (iii) costs relating to the conversion and loading of data, and (iv) costs relating to the integration of the Migration Assets into the Partnership Entities' information technology systems. (iii) Costs Relating to Transition Services. All costs and expenses associated with ongoing maintenance and support services provided by the Selling Parties or their Affiliates with respect to the Migration Assets, whether provided under the Transition Services Agreement (other than Implementation Costs) or otherwise, shall not be subject to the Expense Limit. (f) Miscellaneous. In the case of Transferred Assets (including software and computer hardware associated with the ATLAS 2000 System) that are (i) leased by the Selling Parties or their Affiliates, such leases shall be transferred to Buyer, and upon such transfer, Buyer shall assume full responsibility for such leases, and (ii) assigned to any of the Partnership Entities, including license and contract rights, the Selling Parties shall secure any consents necessary for such assignments. If Buyer elects to obtain its own leases or licenses for Substituted Assets without the assistance of the Selling Parties, Buyer shall upon the request of the Selling Parties submit to them documentation showing proper licensing prior to the end of the IT Migration Period SECTION 4.12. SOFTWARE LICENSE. With respect to any Licensed Software that is included in the Transferred Assets (the "TRANSFERRED LICENSED SOFTWARE"), the Selling Parties, for themselves and on behalf of their Affiliates, shall, in accordance with Section 4.11(d), grant to the Partnership Entities and the Buyer and its Affiliates, a worldwide nonexclusive royalty-free, perpetual license, with the right to assign and sublicense only to such Affiliates, to use, copy, modify, enhance, and upgrade, solely for their internal business purposes and not as a service bureau, the Transferred Licensed Software, except as not permitted pursuant to any license relating thereto. Any copies of the Transferred Licensed Software and any documentation related thereto must contain all copyright and other intellectual property rights notices included thereon at the time of Closing. The Partnership Entities and Buyer shall not be entitled to receive and Selling Parties and their Affiliates shall have no obligation to provide any modifications, enhancements, or upgrades made to the Transferred Licensed Software developed subsequent to the date of transfer of such Licensed Transferred Software to the Buyer or the Partnership Entities. To the extent that they possess such, the Selling Parties and their Affiliates shall provide copies to Buyer and the Partnership Entities of the source code for all Transferred Licensed Software. Ownership of all -41-
intellectual property rights in the Transferred Licensed Software remains with Selling Parties and their Affiliates; provided, following the date of transfer to Buyer and the Partnership Entities, the intellectual property rights to any modifications, enhancements and upgrades to the Transferred Licensed Software will be owned by the party making such modifications, enhancements and upgrades and there shall be no right for any party to disclose such to any other party. The Partnership Entities and Buyer shall not take any action that is materially inconsistent with the Selling Parties' and their Affiliates' rights in the Transferred Licensed Software. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this section, the Transferred Licensed Software and any related documentation are provided on an "as is" basis, and the Selling Parties and their Affiliates hereby expressly disclaim any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. The Selling Parties and their Affiliates do not warrant that the Transferred Licensed Software or documentation are error-free or that the Partnership Entities' or Buyer's use thereof will be uninterrupted. Buyer shall have the right to transfer its rights as granted herein to a third party only upon the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Securities or the assets of the Partnership Entities or a majority of the New LLC Interests to such third party, except to the extent any such transfer is not permitted pursuant to any license relating thereto. All rights with respect to Transferred Licensed Software not expressly granted to Buyer in this Section 4.12 are retained by the Selling Parties and their Affiliates. SECTION 4.13. NON-SOFTWARE COPYRIGHT LICENSE. Effective upon the Closing Date, the Selling Parties, for themselves and on behalf of their Affiliates, hereby grant to the Partnership Entities, Buyer and its Affiliates, a nonexclusive royalty-free, perpetual license, without right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, enhance, and upgrade, solely for their internal business purposes and not as a service bureau, all manuals, user guides, standards and operation procedures and similar documents owned by the Selling Parties and/or their Affiliates and used by the Partnership Entities. All copies of the foregoing must reproduce and include all copyright and other intellectual property rights notices as such appear on such items at the time of Closing or as specifically provided with respect to any such item by the Selling Parties. All rights with respect to such items not expressly granted to Buyer in this Section 4.13 are retained by the Selling Parties and their Affiliates. SECTION 4.14. TRANSITIONAL TRADEMARK LICENSE; LEGAL NAMES. (a) Effective upon the Closing Date, the Selling Parties and their Affiliates, hereby grant to the Partnership Entities, Buyer and its Affiliates a nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license, without right to sublicense, to use, solely in the Partnership Entities' businesses as they have been conducted since February 9, 2001 and as they are presently conducted, any and all trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade dress and domain names owned by the Selling Parties and their Affiliates solely to the extent appearing on existing inventory, advertising materials and property of the Partnership Entities (such as signage, vehicles, and equipment) (collectively "SELLERS' MARKS") for a period of nine (9) months from the Closing Date ("LICENSE PERIOD"). The Buyer and the Partnership Entities may use such existing inventory, advertising materials and property during the License Period, but shall not create new inventory, advertising materials or property using Sellers' Marks. Buyer and the Partnership Entities shall promptly replace or remove Sellers' Marks on inventory, advertising materials and other property, provided that all such use shall cease no later than the end of the -42-
License Period.

SECTION 4.16. OFFICE LEASE; OFFICE FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT; OFFICE SUPPLIES. Buyer and the Selling Parties shall negotiate in good faith to enter into a lease, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, between the Selling Parties or an Affiliate, as lessor, and Buyer or a Partnership Entity, as lessee, for a term of not less than five (5) years and at a rate comparable to that for similar unfurnished commercial space in Tulsa, Oklahoma, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, to provide the office space at One Williams Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, currently occupied by the Transferred Employees and the IT Assets transferred to Buyer or the Partnership Entities under the IT Migration Plan or such other or additional space in One Williams Center as may be mutually agreed upon. The lease will also provide for Williams to provide PBX services to Buyer and the Partnership Entities for the term of such lease, at a cost that is agreed upon by the parties and will be incorporated into such lease. At such time as Buyer and the Partnership Entities relocate from the One Williams Center building in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Williams agrees to purchase on behalf of Buyer and the Partnership Entities a system sufficient to provide PBX services to Buyer and the Partnership Entities in their new location. Upon the execution and delivery of such lease, the Selling Parties will transfer, without additional consideration, to the Partnership Entities (i) the material office furniture and equipment owned by the Selling Parties or their Affiliates and currently used by the Transferred Employees (at One Williams Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma) and (ii) office supplies of the type currently used by such Transferred Employees in a quantity sufficient to last for approximately ninety (90) days assuming customary usage in accordance with past practices. Effective as of the Closing, regardless of the execution of such lease, the Selling Parties hereby transfer, without additional consideration, to the Partnership Entities all office furniture owned by the Selling Parties or their Affiliates that is currently used by the Transferred Employees or the Partnership Entities at locations other than One Williams Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

(b) Notwithstanding the provision of Section 4.17(a) above, the board of directors of the New Company shall be entitled to take (and to cause any of the other Partnership Entities to take) any action otherwise prohibited by such Section 4.17(a) in response to any inquiry, contact or proposal received by New Company, its board of directors or any of the other Partnership Entities from a Person that is not an Affiliate of the Selling Parties or the Partnership Entities, if: (i) any discussions and exchanges of information between New Company (or the other Partnership Entities) and such third party are subject to a customary confidentiality agreement that will allow for the disclosure to Buyer provided in Section 4.17(c) below, (ii) such -44-
inquiry, contact or proposal includes a proposal to acquire at least a majority of the outstanding Common Units held by Persons that are not Affiliates of the Selling Parties or a majority in value of the consolidated assets of the Partnership Entities, (iii) such inquiry, contact or proposal from any such non-Affiliated Person was not received in violation of Section 4.17(a) and (iv) the board of directors of the New Company shall have determined in its good faith judgment, after consultation with legal counsel, that any failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the New Company, as the general partner of the Partnership, to the holders of Common Units under the Delaware LP Act. The Selling Parties agree that they will notify Buyer immediately if any such inquiry, contact or proposal is received by New Company, its board of directors or any of the other Partnership Entities or their respective representatives, and, to the extent known by the Selling Parties, thereafter shall keep Buyer informed, on a reasonably current basis, on the status of any such inquiry, contact or proposal and a resulting negotiations or discussions.

(d) In the event that the Partnership calls a meeting of unitholders with a record date prior to the Closing Date (including a special meeting to consider the approval of a Definitive Transaction Agreement) and the Closing occurs prior to such meeting, the Selling Parties agree to grant to Buyer, effective at Closing, an irrevocable proxy to vote the WES Units, WNGL Units and the Class B Common Units with respect to any matter to be considered at such meeting.

(vii) For purposes of this Section 8.2(c), Buyer shall pay to the Partnership all amounts due under this Section 8.2(c) following receipt of such amounts due from the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership. The determination of amounts and when they are due shall be made in good faith solely by the General Partner; provided, however, that Buyer shall not be required to make any such payments within less than twenty (20) days after receipt of the General Partner's determination; provided, further, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Selling Parties from any and all Losses caused by any delay by Buyer in making any such payment to the Partnership under this Section 8.2(c)(vii). (viii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.2(c), in no event shall the aggregate amounts payable by or on behalf of Buyer under this Section 8.2(c) exceed $21,870,000 (the "MAXIMUM OBLIGATION"). (d) The foregoing indemnification obligations shall be subject to the following limitations: (i) the Selling Parties' aggregate liability under Section 8.2(a) shall not exceed $175,000,000 (the "CAP"); provided, however, that the Cap shall not be applicable with respect to Losses otherwise indemnifiable under Section 8.2(a)(i) with respect to breaches or inaccuracies of Section 2.27 or under 8.2(a)(v); (ii) no indemnification for any Losses asserted against the Selling Parties under Section 8.2(a)(i) shall be required unless and until the cumulative aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds $4,000,000 (the "DEDUCTIBLE"), at which point the Selling Parties shall be obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties the amount of such Losses in excess of the Deductible, subject to the Cap; provided however, that the Deductible shall not be applicable to breaches under Sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 2.11(b), 2.18, 2.21 or 2.27 hereof or recovery under Sections 8.2(a)(ii), 8.2(a)(iii), 8.2(a)(iv) or 8.2(a)(v) hereof; (iii) the amount of any Losses suffered by a Seller Indemnified Party or a Buyer Indemnified Party, as the case may be (such party seeking indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY," and the other party, the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY"), shall be reduced by any third-party insurance or other indemnification benefits which such party receives in respect of or as a result of such Losses, less the reasonable costs incurred to recover those insurance or indemnification benefits to the extent such costs are not otherwise recovered. If any Losses for which indemnification is provided hereunder is subsequently reduced by any third-party insurance or other indemnification benefit or recovery, the amount of the reduction shall be remitted to the Indemnifying Party. In the case of any purchase agreement between a Partnership Entity and a third-party relating to the acquisition of assets, businesses or securities by such Partnership Entity that contains unexpired and otherwise applicable indemnification provisions, if any Loss for which Buyer is entitled to seek indemnity from the Selling Parties under Section 8.2(a) is also included within the matters for which the Partnership Entities are entitled to indemnity under any such third-party agreement, Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such Partnership Entity -55-
first to pursue indemnification under such third-party agreement in good faith for a reasonable period of time prior to enforcing any claim against the Selling Parties for indemnification hereunder. Nothing in the foregoing sentence shall (i) prejudice the rights of the Buyer Indemnified Parties to make a claim for indemnification hereunder within the applicable survival period, if any, or (ii) require any Buyer Indemnified Party to file or institute any judicial proceeding or action. In addition, to the extent the Selling Parties make any payments to any Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to any claims covered under the unexpired and otherwise applicable indemnification provisions of such third-party agreements, Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable Partnership Entity or Entities, at the sole cost and expense of the Selling Parties, (A) to assign any rights to the Selling Parties under such third-party agreement as may be necessary to allow the Selling Parties to independently pursue a claim for indemnification against the counterparty or counterparties to such third-party agreement and (B) to be subrogated to the rights of the applicable Partnership Entity or Entities in respect of such indemnification claims; (iv) no claim may be asserted nor may any action be commenced against any party for breach or inaccuracy of any representation or breach of a warranty, unless written notice of such claim or action is received by the other party describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or action on or prior to the date on which the representation or warranty on which such claim or action is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section 8.1; (v) no Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this Agreement to multiple recovery for the same Losses; and (vi) the limitations on indemnification set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 8.2(d) shall not apply to any Losses arising from the failure by the Selling Parties or Buyer to pay any Taxes in accordance with Section 4.9 or for any amounts payable in accordance with Section 9.3 hereof. SECTION 8.3. PROCEDURES. (a) Any Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party (with reasonable detail) promptly after it becomes aware of facts supporting a claim or action for indemnification under this Article VIII, and shall provide to the Indemnifying Party as soon as practicable thereafter all reasonable available information and documentation necessary to support and verify any Losses associated with such claim or action. Subject to Section 8.2(d)(iv), the failure to so notify or provide information to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure to give such notice, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved from its obligations hereunder to the extent of such material prejudice. The Indemnifying Party shall participate in and defend, contest or otherwise protect the Indemnified Party against any such claim or action by counsel of the Indemnifying Party's choice at its sole cost and expense; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not make any settlement or compromise without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall -56-
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party, there is no admission or statement of fault or culpability on the part of the Indemnified Party and there is an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability on any claims that are the subject of such claim or action. The Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate at its own expense in the defense thereof by counsel of the Indemnified Party's choice and shall in any event use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with and assist the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall pay the fees and expenses of separate counsel for the Indemnified Party if (i) the Indemnifying Party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses or (ii) counsel for the Indemnifying Party reasonably determines that representation of both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel would create a conflict of interest. If the Indemnifying Party fails timely to defend, contest or otherwise protect against such suit, action, investigation, claim or proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to do so, including, without limitation, the right to make any compromise or settlement thereof, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover the entire cost thereof from the Indemnifying Party, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, disbursements and amounts paid as the result of such suit, action, investigation, claim or proceeding. (b) Any claim or action for indemnification under Section 8.2(a)(i) (for Losses arising from, or relating to a breach of a representation or warranty set forth in Section 2.21) or Section 8.2(a)(iv), that requires remediation shall be administered in accordance with the procedures set forth on Schedule 8.3(b) hereto. SECTION 8.4. WAIVER OF CONSEQUENTIAL, ETC. DAMAGES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, BUYER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO ANY OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, NOR SHALL ANY OF THE SELLING PARTIES BE LIABLE TO ANY OF THE BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, FOR ANY EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, REMOTE, OR SPECULATIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DAMAGES ON ACCOUNT OF LOST PROFITS OR OPPORTUNITIES) RESULTING FROM OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. SECTION 8.5. COMPLIANCE WITH EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE. ALL RELEASES, DISCLAIMERS, LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY, AND INDEMNITIES IN THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THOSE IN THIS ARTICLE VIII, SHALL APPLY EVEN IN THE EVENT OF THE SOLE, JOINT, AND/OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER FAULT OF THE PARTY WHOSE LIABILITY IS RELEASED, DISCLAIMED, LIMITED, OR INDEMNIFIED. SECTION 8.6. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. If Buyer breaches its obligations to close as contemplated by Article V, then Buyer shall pay to the Selling Parties $25,000,000 by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank -57-
account in the United States of America designated in writing by the Selling Parties not later than three days following receipt of such designation. BUYER AND THE SELLING PARTIES HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT (I) THE EXTENT OF DAMAGES TO THE SELLING PARTIES CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF THIS TRANSACTION TO BE CONSUMMATED DUE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES SPECIFIED IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING SENTENCE WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE OR EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN, (II) THE AMOUNT OF THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVIDED FOR IN THIS SECTION 8.6 IS A FAIR AND REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF SUCH DAMAGES UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AND (III) RECEIPT OF SUCH AMOUNT BY THE SELLING PARTIES DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A PENALTY AND WILL BE THE SELLING PARTIES' SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES SPECIFIED IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING SENTENCE. SECTION 8.7. REMEDY. Except for seeking equitable relief under Section 9.12 or otherwise or actions involving fraud or as set forth in Section 9.5, from and after the Closing the sole remedy of a party in connection with (i) a breach or inaccuracy of the representations, or breach of warranties, in this Agreement or any certificates or other documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement on Closing, or (ii) any failure by a party to perform or observe any term, provision, covenant, or agreement on the part of such party to be performed or observed under this Agreement, shall, in each case, be as set forth in this Article VIII. SECTION 8.8. TAX TREATMENT OF INDEMNITY PAYMENTS. Each party, to the extent permitted by applicable law, agrees to treat any payments made pursuant to this Article VIII as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all federal and state income and franchise Tax purposes. To the extent that any such payment is not permitted to be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, the amount of such payment shall be increased so that after reduction for the amount of any actual additional Tax cost incurred as a result of the receipt of such payment, the amount remaining will be equal to the amount of the payment that is owed under this Article VIII. ARTICLE IX. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS SECTION 9.1. PUBLICITY. On or prior to the Closing Date, no party shall, nor shall it permit its Affiliates to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the consent of the other party hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any such press release or announcement is required by law or stock exchange rule to be made by the party proposing to issue the same, such party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party prior to the issuance of any such press release or announcement. -58-
SECTION 9.2. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

No party shall sell, assign or otherwise transfer all or any of its rights, benefits or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided, however, that (a) Buyer may, without the Selling Parties' prior written consent, assign or transfer its rights and duties hereunder to the Partnership (or an Affiliate of Buyer other than a Partnership Entity) and, if so assigned or transferred, the Partnership (or such Affiliate of Buyer other than a Partnership Entity) shall be entitled to enforce the rights, and shall comply with the duties, hereunder so transferred or assigned as if it were a named party hereto, but no such transfer or assignment shall relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder and no such assignee or transferee may further assign any such rights, (b) for the purposes of any financing or refinancing arrangement entered into by the Buyer in connection with the purchase of the Securities the Buyer may, without the Selling Parties' prior written consent, assign to or create a security interest in favor of any party providing any such financing or refinancing to the Buyer, all of its rights, benefits, obligations and interests hereunder, and the Selling Parties hereby consent to the exercise by any such party of any rights, benefits, obligations or interests assigned to or created in favor of such party pursuant to the foregoing and any remedies arising in connection therewith and (c) each of the Selling Parties may, without Buyer's prior written consent, assign or transfer its rights under Section 8.2(c) hereof to one or more of the Partnership Entities and, if so assigned or transferred, any such Partnership Entity shall be entitled to enforce the rights hereunder so transferred or assigned as if it were a named party hereto, but no such transfer or assignment shall relieve the Selling Parties of their obligations under Section 8.2(c) and no such assignee or transferee may further assign any such rights. SECTION 9.3. INVESTMENT BANKERS, FINANCIAL ADVISORS, BROKERS AND FINDERS.

(i) If the Buyer Entity and the General Partner agree on such terms within sixty (60) days after receipt by the General Partner of the Buyer Offer, a member of the Partnership Group shall purchase the Restricted Assets on such terms as soon as commercially practicable after such agreement has been reached; (ii) If the Buyer Entity and the General Partner are unable to agree on the terms of a sale during the 60-day period after receipt by the General Partner of the Buyer Offer, the Buyer Entity and the General Partner will engage an independent investment banking firm with a national reputation to determine the fair market value of the Restricted Assets. In determining the fair market value of the Restricted Assets, the investment banking firm will have access to the proposed sale and purchase values for the Restricted Assets submitted by the Buyer Entity and the General Partner, respectively. Such investment banking firm will determine the value of the Restricted Assets within thirty (30) days and furnish the Buyer Entity and the General Partner its opinion of such value. The fees of the investment banking firm's appraisal will be split equally between the Buyer Entity and the MLP. Upon receipt of such opinion, the General Partner will have the option, but not the obligation to: (iii) (A) cause a member of the Partnership Group to purchase the Restricted Assets in accordance with the following process: (1) if the valuation of the investment banking firm is in the range between the proposed sale/purchase values of the Buyer Entity and the General Partner, a member of the Partnership Group will have the right to purchase the Restricted Assets at the valuation submitted by the investment banking firm; (2) if the valuation of the investment banking firm is less than the proposed purchase value submitted by the General Partner, a member of the Partnership Group will have the right to purchase the Restricted Assets for the amount submitted by the General Partner; and (3) if the valuation of the investment banking firm is greater than the proposed sale value submitted by the Buyer Entity, a member of the Partnership Group will have the right to purchase Page 10

In no event shall the obligation of Buyer to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Partnership Entities to cooperate with Williams as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence be construed as imposing upon the Buyer or the Partnership Entities an obligation to hire and pay for counsel in connection with the defense of any claims covered by the indemnification set forth in this Article VI, it being agreed that the Williams Parties, jointly and severally, shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel; provided, further, that Buyer or the Partnership Entities may hire and pay for separate counsel in connection with any such defense, at the Buyers or the Partnership's own option, cost and expense, as the case may be; provided, further, that the Williams Parties, jointly and severally, shall pay the fees and expenses of separate counsel for the Buyer or the Partnership Entities if (i) the Williams Parties have agreed to pay such fees and expenses or (ii) counsel for the Williams Parties reasonably determines that representation of both the Williams Parties, on the one hand, and the Partnership Entities, on the other hand, by the same counsel would create a conflict of interest. Williams agrees to keep any counsel hired by the Partnership Entities reasonably informed as to the status of any such defense, but Williams shall have the right to retain sole control over such defense except as provided above. (d) In determining the amount of any loss, cost, damage or expense for which any of the Partnership Entities are to be indemnified under Sections 4.1, 5.1 or 5.2, the gross amount of the indemnification will be reduced by (i) any insurance proceeds realized or to be realized by the Partnership Entities, and such correlative insurance benefit shall be net of any incremental insurance premium that becomes due and payable by the Partnership Entities as a result of such claim and (ii) all amounts recovered or recoverable by any Partnership Entity under contractual indemnities from third Persons as described in Section 4.1. ARTICLE VII GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES 7.1 G&A CAP AMOUNT. (a) Subject to Section 7.2, the amount of general and administrative expenses reimbursed by the Partnership Group to the Buyer Entities (or, in the case of Section 7.1(b)(i)(A) below, to the Williams Entities) for any MLP fiscal year shall not exceed the amounts calculated pursuant to Section 7.1(b) (for any MLP fiscal year, the "G&A Cap Amount"). (b) (i) 2003 Fiscal Year. For the MLP fiscal year ending on December 31, 2003, the G&A Cap Amount shall be calculated as follows: (A) For the period beginning on January 1, 2003 and ending on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "2003 Pre-Closing Page 13
Stub Period"), the amount of general and administrative expenses reimbursed by the Partnership Group to the Williams Entities shall not exceed $37.9 million times a fraction, (X) the numerator of which is the number of successive whole months beginning with January 2003 and ending with the month in which the Closing occurs and (Y) the denominator of which is twelve (12) (the "2003 Pre-Closing Cap"). To the extent that the Partnership Group reimbursed the Williams Entities for general and administrative expenses incurred in 2003 in excess of the 2003 Pre-Closing Cap, the Williams Parties shall reimburse the MLP for any such excess amounts and shall make such payment no later than thirty (30) days following the Closing Date. To the extent that the Williams Entities paid unreimbursed general and administrative expenses up to the 2003 Pre-Closing Cap, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the MLP to, make payment to the appropriate Williams Entity of such unreimbursed amount no later than thirty (30) days following the Closing Date. (B) For the period beginning with the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2003 (the "2003 Post-Closing Stub Period"), the amount of general and administrative expenses reimbursed by the Partnership Group to the Buyer Entities shall not exceed the sum of (1) the product of $37.9 million (as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii)) times a fraction, (X) the numerator of which is the number of successive whole months beginning with the month following the month in which the Closing occurs and ending with December 2003 and (Y) the denominator of which is twelve (12) (the "2003 Post-Closing Cap"), plus (2) the amount of general and administrative expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Partnership Group in excess of the 2003 Post-Closing Upper Cap Amount less any amounts duly reimbursed by the Williams Parties to the Buyer Entities pursuant to Section 7.2(c)(iii)(A). (ii) Succeeding Fiscal Years. For each succeeding MLP fiscal year beginning with the MLP fiscal year ending December 31, 2004, the G&A Cap Amount shall be calculated as follows: (A) The G&A Cap Amount from the preceding fiscal year (as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii)) shall be increased by the greater of (A) 7% per year and (B) the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index - All Urban Consumers, U.S. City Average, Not Seasonally Adjusted. (B) For purposes of calculating the initial increase in the G&A Cap Amount for the MLP fiscal year ending on December 31, 2004, the G&A Cap Amount for the 2003 fiscal year shall be $37.9 million (as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii) for acquisitions, construction, capital improvements, replacements or expansions occurring in 2003). Page 14
(iii) Adjustment for Acquisitions and Other Events. If, after the Closing Date, the Partnership Group (A) makes an acquisition, (B) constructs or causes to be constructed any assets to be owned, leased or operated by any member of the Partnership Group or (C) makes or causes to be made any capital improvements, replacements or expansions of any assets owned, leased or operated by any member of the Partnership Group, the amount of general and administrative expenses reimbursed by the Partnership Group to the Buyer Entities will be increased by the Buyer's good faith reasonable estimate of the additional amount of annual general and administrative expenses to be incurred by or on behalf of the Partnership Group with respect to such acquisition, construction, capital improvement, replacement or expansion. The appropriate portion of the additional general and administrative expenses shall be added to the G&A Cap Amount and the Upper Cap Amount in the year in which such acquisition, construction, capital improvement, replacement or expansion occurs and the full amount of such general and administrative expenses shall be added to the G&A Cap Amount and the Upper Cap Amount thereafter. 7.2 CERTAIN LIMITATIONS. The provisions of Section 7.1 shall be subject to the following limitations: (a) Expiration of G&A Cap. The amount of general and administrative expenses reimbursed by the Partnership Group to the Buyer Entities shall not be limited under this Agreement with respect to any fiscal year ending after December 31, 2010. (b) Certain Expenses Not Included. General and administrative expenses with respect to the following matters shall be excluded in determining limitations herein on the amount of general and administrative expenses that are required to be reimbursed by the Partnership Group or the Williams Parties to the Buyer Entities: (i) expenses associated with equity-based incentive compensation plans; or (ii) general and administrative expenses incurred by Buyer that are covered under Section 4.15 to the Purchase Agreement, regardless of whether in excess of the Expense Limit (as defined in Section 4.15 to the Purchase Agreement), it being understood that to the extent the Williams Parties reimburse Buyer for general and administrative expenses in excess of the Expense Limit, Buyer shall promptly pay any such reimbursements to the MLP by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by the MLP. (c) Upper Cap Amount. (i) Notwithstanding the limitations in Section 7.1 on the Partnership Group's reimbursement obligations for general and administrative expenses in excess of the G&A Cap Amount, the Partnership Group (or in the case of Section 7.2(c)(iii), the Williams Parties) shall be required to reimburse the Buyer Entities for general and administrative expenses incurred on behalf of the Partnership Group in any MLP fiscal year in excess of the Upper Cap Amount as calculated below (the "Upper Cap Amount"). Page 15
(ii) The Upper Cap Amount shall be calculated as follows: (A) For the 2003 Post-Closing Stub Period, the Upper Cap Amount shall be equal to the product of [$49.3 million] (as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii)) times a fraction, (X) the numerator of which is the number of successive whole months beginning with the month following the month in which the Closing occurs and ending with month of December 2003 and (Y) the denominator of which is twelve (12) (the "2003 Post-Closing Upper Cap Amount"). (B) For each succeeding MLP fiscal year beginning with the MLP fiscal year ending December 31, 2004, the Upper Cap Amount shall be calculated as follows: (1) The Upper Cap Amount from the preceding fiscal year (as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii)) shall be increased annually by the lesser of (A) 2.5% per year and (B) the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index - All Urban Consumers, U.S. City Average, Not Seasonally Adjusted. (2) For purposes of calculating the initial increase in the Upper Cap Amount for the MLP fiscal year ending on December 31, 2004, the Upper Cap Amount for the 2003 fiscal year shall be [$49.3 million] (as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii) for acquisitions, construction, capital improvements, replacements and expansions occurring in 2003). (iii) For the twelve months immediately following the Closing Date, the Williams Parties shall be required to reimburse the Buyer Entities for any and all general and administrative expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Partnership Group in excess of the Upper Cap Amount, as follows: (A) If, during the 2003 Post-Closing Stub Period, the general and administrative expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Partnership Group are in an amount in excess of 2003 Post-Closing Upper Cap Amount, the Williams Parties, jointly and severally, shall be required to reimburse the Buyer Entities in full for the amount of such excess and shall make such payment no later than thirty (30) days after the last day of the 2003 Post-Closing Stub Period by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by the Buyer Entities. (B) If, during the period beginning on January 1, 2004 and ending on the last day of the month in which the first anniversary of the Closing Date occurs (the "2004 Stub Period"), the general and administrative expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Partnership Group exceed the Upper Cap Amount for the MLP fiscal year ended December Page 16
31, 2004 multiplied by a fraction, (X) the numerator of which is the number of successive months beginning with January 2004 and ending with the month in which the 2004 Stub Period ends and (Y) the denominator of which is twelve (12) (the "2004 Stub Period Upper Cap Amount"), the Williams Parties, jointly and severally, shall be required to reimburse the Buyer Entities in full for the amount of such excess and shall make such payment no later than thirty (30) days after the last day of the 2004 Stub Period by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by the Buyer Entities. If Buyer becomes obligated to pay the 5% premium for transition services pursuant to the final proviso in Section 4(a) of the Transition Services Agreement, then for purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, the 2004 Stub Period Upper Cap Amount shall be increased by the portion of such premium constituting general and administrative expenses of the Partnership Group attributable to the 2004 Stub Period. (C) Buyer shall, and shall cause each of the other Buyer Entities to, use good faith efforts to minimize the amount of general and administrative expenses incurred by any of the Buyer Entities and for which the Williams Parties would be required to reimburse the Buyer Entities under this Section 7.2(c)(iii). (D) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VII, the Williams Entities will not have any obligations to reimburse the Buyer Entities for general and administrative expenses incurred on behalf of the Partnership Group or otherwise, except as specifically provided in this Section 7.2(c)(iii). (iv) Except as provided in Section 7.2(c)(iii), the Partnership Group shall be required to reimburse the Buyer Entities for any and all general and administrative expenses in excess of the Upper Cap Amount incurred by or on behalf of the Partnership Group in any MLP fiscal year. 7.3 NO AFFECT ON SECTION 7.4 OF THE MLP AGREEMENT. Nothing in this Article VII is intended or shall be construed to affect or modify the terms and conditions of Section 7.4 of the MLP Agreement. ARTICLE VIII CAPITAL EXPENDITURES 8.1 WILLIAMS REIMBURSEMENT OF PARTNERSHIP GROUP MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. The Williams Entities will reimburse the Partnership Group in each of the MLP's 2003 and 2004 fiscal years for any reasonable and customary maintenance capital expenditures made by the Partnership Group, in accordance with past practices, to maintain the assets of WPL, in either year, in excess of $19 million; provided, that the Williams Entities shall not be required to reimburse the Partnership Group in excess of an aggregate amount of $15 million under this Page 17
Section 8.1, less any sums previously paid by any Williams Entity to the Partnership Group pursuant to Section 6.1(b) of the Old Omnibus Agreement and set forth on Schedule 8.1. ARTICLE IX MISCELLANEOUS 9.1 PAYMENTS; DISPUTED AMOUNTS; AUDIT RIGHTS. (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any payments to be made by the Williams Entities to Buyer or the Partnership Entities under this Agreement shall be made by the Williams Entities within sixty (60) days of receipt of a written request for such payment from Buyer (which request shall contain a description in reasonable detail of the individual costs and expenses that comprise the aggregate amount of the payment requested) (a "Payment Request"). In the event of a good faith dispute as to the amount of such payment, the applicable Williams Entity shall give written notice of such dispute on or before the due date with respect to all or any portion of the Payment Request, with the particulars of such dispute. Upon receipt of such notice, Buyer shall, or shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Partnership Entities to, furnish to the applicable Williams Entity additional supporting documentation to reasonably substantiate the amount of the Payment Request. Upon delivery of such additional documentation, the applicable Williams Entity and the Buyer Entities shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to resolve such dispute. If they are unable to resolve their dispute within twenty (20) business days of the delivery of such additional supporting documentation to the applicable Williams Entity, then the dispute shall be referred for resolution by a firm of independent accountants of nationally recognized standing reasonably satisfactory to each of Buyer and the applicable Williams Entity (the "Accounting Referee"), which shall determine the disputed amounts within thirty (30) days of the referral of such dispute to such Accounting Referee. The determination of the Accounting Referee shall not require the applicable Williams Entity to pay more than the amount in dispute nor require Buyer or any Partnership Entity to return any amount previously paid by the applicable Williams Entity. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne equally by the applicable Williams Entity, on the one hand, and Buyer or a member of the Partnership Entities, on the other hand. The determination of the Accounting Referee shall be finally binding. If any dispute is resolved in favor of Buyer or any Partnership Entity, the applicable Williams Entity shall make payment to Buyer or the applicable Partnership Entity within thirty (30) days of resolution of the dispute. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Williams Entities be entitled to withhold any amounts other than those portions of the applicable payment that are in dispute. (b) Williams shall have the right, at any time within six (6) months after the date of any payment by Williams to Buyer or the Partnership Entities pursuant to a Payment Request to audit those books and records of Buyer and/or any Partnership Entity that incurred costs or expenses attributable to such Payment Request or which books and records relate thereto, to verify the amount reflected on such Payment Request. Any such audit shall be conducted during normal business hours by Williams or its designated auditor after ten (10) days prior written notice to Buyer, at Williams' sole cost and expense, in the offices of Buyer and the relevant Partnership Entities or such other location as may be mutually agreed. Buyer shall cooperate and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any relevant Partnership Entity to cooperate with and provide reasonable assistance to Williams and/or its auditor in connection Page 18
with the performance of any such audit. Williams shall assert any claim for refund of amounts reimbursed to Buyer or the Partnership Entities under the audited Payment Request within sixty (60) days after the completion of the audit. Buyer shall have sixty (60) days from receipt of Williams' claim for refund to respond. If Buyer does not dispute Williams' refund claim, Buyer or the applicable Partnership Entity shall pay such refund within such 60-day period. Should Buyer dispute the claim and refuse to pay any refund claim by Williams resulting from the exercise of Williams' audit rights, the parties will refer the dispute to an Accounting Referee in the manner described in Section 9.1(a) above. 9.2 THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY; ASSIGNMENT; ENFORCEMENT. (a) Each of Buyer and the Williams Parties specifically intends that each entity comprising the Partnership Entities or the Partnership Group, as applicable, shall be entitled to assert rights and remedies hereunder as third-party beneficiaries hereto with respect to those provisions of this Agreement affording a right, benefit or privilege to any such entity.

NEWSRELEASE (WILLIAMS LOGO) NYSE: WMB EXHIBIT 99.3 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- DATE: April 21, 2003 WILLIAMS REACHES $1.1 BILLION AGREEMENT TO SELL INTEREST IN MASTER LIMITED PARTNERSHIP TULSA, Okla. - Williams (NYSE:WMB) announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to sell its 54.6 percent ownership interest in Williams Energy Partners L.P. (NYSE:WEG) in a $1.1 billion transaction. The buyer, a newly formed entity owned equally by Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC and Carlyle/Riverstone Global Energy and Power Fund II, L.P., has agreed to pay approximately $512 million in cash to Williams. The sale also will have the effect of removing $570 million of the partnership's debt from Williams' consolidated balance sheet. The sale is scheduled to close in May, subject to standard closing conditions. Williams expects to recognize a pre-tax gain of at least $285 million to $300 million, which will be reported in discontinued operations. Including today's announcement, Williams this year has sold or agreed to sell assets for more than $2.6 billion in cash and relief of nearly $900 million in debt. The cash figure includes proceeds from assets the company identified for sale earlier this year as part of its liquidity-management plan, as well as two transactions in the company's energy marketing and trading portfolio. "Williams has come a long way in a short time," said Steve Malcolm, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We are pleased with our continued success in narrowing our focus to key natural gas businesses while at the same time attending to the critical tasks of raising cash and reducing debt to strengthen our balance sheet." Williams' aggregate ownership interest in the master limited partnership consists of 100 percent of the general partnership interest - which equates to 2 percent of the total partnership interest and includes the associated incentive-distribution rights - and 52.6 percent of the limited partnership interests. The limited partnership interests include the Class B units Williams received in the sale of Williams Pipe Line to Williams Energy Partners in April 2002. "This agreement moves us closer to wrapping up major asset sales and rounding out what Williams will look like in the near future. We are reshaping and resizing Williams to focus on natural gas production, natural gas processing and natural gas transportation," Malcolm said. "Parting with our interest in Williams Energy Partners substantially ends our nearly four decades of participation in the oil segment of the energy industry." Under the terms of the agreement, Williams will receive approximately $510 million at closing and up to $2 million in August, assuming closing occurs on or after May 15.
In addition and subsequent to closing, the buyer's future sales of equity at net prices exceeding $37.50 per unit could provide Williams with an additional cash incentive of up to $20 million. "To the extent that the market rewards the partnership for the transition to a well-capitalized general partner with a stated desire to expand the business, Williams will be in a position to capture up to $20 million in cash incentive from the buyer's future resale of equity," Malcolm said. Williams Energy Partners' assets include a 6,700-mile refined products pipeline system and 39 related storage terminals, an ammonia pipeline system, five marine terminal facilities located along waterways such as the Houston Ship Channel, and 23 inland terminal facilities connected to third-party pipelines. The buyer expects to offer employment to more than 800 Williams employees whose jobs are primarily dedicated to providing general, administrative and operations support to the assets in the partnership. Williams will continue to provide services to the partnership and buyer during a transition period, though the existing services agreement between Williams and the partnership will terminate - effectively relieving Williams from any continuing obligation to bear a portion of the partnership's expenses. Lehman Brothers and Citigroup acted as financial advisers to Williams in connection with the transaction. ABOUT WILLIAMS (NYSE: WMB) Williams, through its subsidiaries, primarily finds, produces, gathers, processes and transports natural gas. Williams' gas wells, pipelines and midstream facilities are concentrated in the Northwest, Rocky Mountains, Gulf Coast and Eastern Seaboard. More information is available at www.williams.com.
