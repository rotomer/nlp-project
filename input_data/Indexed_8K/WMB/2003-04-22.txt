INDEX TO EXHIBITS

EXHIBIT 99.1 PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTING WILLIAMS ENERGY PARTNERS AND TEXAS GAS TRANSMISSION CORPORATION AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS As previously announced on February 20, 2003, Williams reported it intended to offer for sale its general partner and limited partner interests in Williams Energy Partners and its 5,800-mile Texas Gas pipeline system. In April 2003, Williams' Board of Directors approved resolutions that authorized management to execute and deliver, in the name of the sellers, agreements for the sales of the above mentioned businesses. The following unaudited pro forma financial information is included to supplement Williams' previously issued consolidated financial statements included in Williams' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, to present the operations of Williams Energy Partners and Texas Gas as discontinued operations. The impact to consolidated revenues as reported in Williams' Annual Report on Form 10-K as a result of this reclassification was a decrease of $659.5 million, $600.3 million and $622 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The combined net income impact of these operations previously included in income (loss) from continuing operations was $78.7 million, $102.5 million and $120.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations does not reflect any potential gain or loss related to the expected sales. Consistent with Williams' previously issued consolidated financial statements, other assets and/or businesses are also reported as discontinued operations, those being Kern River natural gas pipeline system, Central natural gas pipeline system, soda ash mining operations, Mid-America and Seminole Pipelines, Midsouth refinery and related assets, Williams travel centers, bio-energy facilities and Williams Communications Group, Inc. For comparative purposes, income (loss) from continuing operations as reported in Williams' Form 10-K was a loss of $501.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and income of $802.7 million and $820.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Additionally, the reported loss from discontinued operations was $253.2 million, $1,280.4 million and $296.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
