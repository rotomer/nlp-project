The foregoing sentence shall not apply in connection with the offering and sale of any Securities to the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement; (h) The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws ("BLUE SKY LAWS") of such states in the United States as the Representatives designate and will continue such qualifications in effect so long as required for the resale of the Securities by the Underwriters; provided that the Company will not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any such state. (i) The Company consents to the use of the Prospectus, in accordance with the Prospectus and the Blue Sky Laws of the jurisdictions in which the Securities are offered by the Underwriters and by all dealers to whom Securities may be sold, in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities. (j) So long as any of the Securities are outstanding, the Company will furnish to the Representatives (i) promptly after it is available, upon request, a copy of each report of the Company filed with any stock exchange or the Commission and (ii) from time to time such other information concerning the Company as the Representatives may reasonably request. (k) The Company and its affiliates have not taken, nor will any of them take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in stabilization or manipulation of the price of the Securities to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities. (l) The Company will take all reasonable action necessary to enable Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw 15
Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"), and Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("MOODY'S") to provide their respective ratings of the Securities. (m) The Company will cooperate with the Representatives and use its reasonable best efforts to permit the Securities to be eligible for clearance and settlement through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company. (n) The Company will use an amount equal to the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities solely as set forth under the caption "Use of Proceeds" in the Prospectus. (o) The Company will not voluntarily claim, and will resist actively all attempts to claim, the benefit of any usury laws against holders of Securities. (p) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including: (i) expenses associated with the preparation, printing and distribution of the Registration Statement and any post-effective amendments thereto, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus and all amendments and supplements thereto; (ii) the preparation, issuance and delivery of the Securities; (iii) the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company and the Company's accountants and of the Trustee and its counsel; (iv) the costs of qualification of the Securities under state securities or blue sky laws in accordance with the provisions of Section 5(i), including filing fees and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection therewith and in connection with the preparation of any blue sky or legal investment memoranda; (v) the costs of printing and delivery to the Underwriters in quantities as herein above stated of copies of each Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto; (vi) the costs of printing and delivery to the Underwriters of copies of any blue sky or legal investment memoranda; (vii) any fees charged by rating agencies for the rating of the Securities; (viii) any filing fees incident to securing the review by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the terms of the sale of the Securities; (ix) any expenses incurred by the Company in connection with any "road show" presentation to potential investors, including without limitation, expenses associated with the production of road show slides and graphics, fees and expenses of any consultants engaged in connection with the road show presentations with the prior approval of the Company, travel and lodging expenses of the representatives and officers of the 16
Company and any such consultants, and the cost of any aircraft chartered in connection with the road show and (x) the performance by the Company of its other obligations under this Agreement to the extent not provided for above. (q) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to do and perform all things required or necessary to be done and performed under this Agreement by it prior to the applicable Closing Date, and to satisfy all conditions precedent to the Underwriters' obligations hereunder to purchase the Securities. 6. INDEMNITY AND CONTRIBUTION. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its directors, its officers, its employees and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or any such director, officer, employee or controlling person in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or (ii) caused by any omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter, or any person controlling such Underwriter, if the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased any Securities from such Underwriter in connection with the initial distribution thereof and a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented, if the Company shall have timely furnished any amendment or supplement thereto, but excluding any documents incorporated by reference therein) 17
was not sent or given by or on behalf of the Underwriters to such person if required to be delivered under the Securities Act, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Securities to such person, and if such Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented, if applicable) would have cured the defect giving rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities. (b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers, its employees and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Underwriters, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto. (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 6, such person (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such action or employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. Such firm shall be designated in writing by Lehman Brothers Inc., in the case of the parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b). It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of 18
more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party. (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 6 is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering and sale of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other 19
relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the Prospectus, bears to the aggregate initial offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. (e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) of this Section 6. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending or appearing as a third party witness in any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price of the Securities purchased by it exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity. (f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 6 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities. 20
(g) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, confirms and the Company acknowledges that the statements with respect to the offering of the Securities by such Underwriter set forth on the last paragraph of the cover page and the third, fourth, fifth, eighth, ninth and tenth paragraphs of text under "Underwriting" in the Prospectus are correct and constitute the only information concerning such Underwriter furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. 7. DEFAULTING UNDERWRITERS. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase on the Closing Date in the respective proportions which the number of Securities set opposite the name of each remaining non-defaulting Underwriter in Schedule 1 hereto bears to the total number of Securities set opposite the names of all the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters in Schedule 1 hereto; provided, however, that the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase any of the Securities on the Closing Date if the total number of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such date exceeds 9.09% of the total number of Securities to be purchased on the Closing Date, and any remaining non-defaulting Underwriter shall not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the number of Securities which it agreed to purchase on the Closing Date pursuant to the terms of Section 2. If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters, or those other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company who so agree shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to purchase, in such proportion as may be agreed upon among them, all the Securities to be purchased on the Closing Date. If the remaining Underwriters or other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company do not elect to purchase the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on the Closing Date, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses to the extent set forth in Sections 5 and 10. As used in this Agreement, the term "UNDERWRITER" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context requires otherwise, any party not listed in Schedule I hereto who, pursuant to this Section 7, purchases Securities which a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase. Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company for damages caused by its default. If other underwriters are obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting or withdrawing Underwriter, either the Representatives or the Company may 21
postpone the Closing Date for up to seven full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement. 8. TERMINATION. This Agreement shall be subject to termination by notice given by the Representatives to the Company, if (a) after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date any of the events described in Section 4(b) shall have occurred or (b) (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities (including, without limitation, an act of terrorism) or any material adverse change in general economic, political or financial conditions (or the effect of international conditions on the financial markets in the United States shall be such) as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company by telecopy or telephone but shall be subsequently confirmed by letter. 9. EFFECTIVENESS. This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto. 10. REIMBURSEMENT OF THE UNDERWRITERS' EXPENSES. If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Representatives because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereunder. 11. NOTICES. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and: 22
(a) if to the Underwriters, shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to Lehman Brothers Inc., 399 Park Avenue, 11th Floor, New York, New York 10022, Attention: Syndicate Department (Fax: 212-526-0943) with a copy, in the case of any notice pursuant to Section 8(c), to the Director of Litigation, Office of the General Counsel, Lehman Brothers Inc., 399 Park Avenue, 15th Floor, New York, NY 10022; (b) if to the Company, shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission c/o The Williams Companies, Inc., One Williams Center, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74172, Attention: Treasurer (Fax: 918-573-2065).

This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Underwriters, the Company and their respective successors. This Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof are for the sole benefit of only those persons, except that (A) the representations, warranties, indemnities and agreements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall also be deemed to be for the benefit of the person or persons, if any, who control any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any person, other than the persons referred to in this Section 12, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. 13. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. 14. PARTIAL UNENFORCEABILITY. If any section, paragraph or provision of this Agreement is for any reason determined to be invalid or unenforceable, such determination shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other section, paragraph or provision hereof. 15.

The Company and each of its Significant Subsidiaries have been duly incorporated or otherwise validly organized or validly formed and are validly existing in good standing under the laws of their respective jurisdictions of formation or incorporation, have the requisite power and authority to own their property and to conduct their business as described in the Prospectus and are duly qualified to do business and are in good standing in each jurisdiction in which their respective ownership or lease of property or the conduct of their respective businesses requires such qualification, except to the extent such failure to be qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and all of the issued shares of capital stock of each Significant Subsidiary that is a corporation have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid, non-assessable and are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims; 2. To the best of such counsel's knowledge, the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries each have all Licenses necessary to own, hold, or lease, as the case may be, and to operate their respective properties and to carry on their respective businesses as presently conducted, except where the failure to possess such Licenses could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received any notice of proceedings relating to revocation or modification of any such Licenses, except to the extent that any such revocation or modification could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; 3. The Company is not in violation of its charter or bylaws, and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, the Company is not (i) in default, and no event has occurred which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default, in the due performance or observance of any term, covenant or condition contained in any Material Contract, or (ii) in violation of any law, ordinance, governmental rule, regulation or court decree to which it or its property or assets may be subject, except as disclosed in the Prospectus, and in the case of (i) and (ii), for such defaults or violations as are not reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;
4. Each of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities have been duly authorized, executed, and delivered by the Company. 5. The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Underwriting Agreement, the Securities and the Indenture will not contravene any law applicable to the Company, or the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or any Material Contract, or any judgment, order, decree of any governmental body, agency or court having jurisdiction over the Company.

1 (as to which such counsel expresses no opinion)), as amended or supplemented, if applicable, did not comply as to form, when filed, in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, (b) the Incorporated Documents did not comply as to form, when filed, in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, (c) the Registration Statement, on the date of the Underwriting Agreement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or to make the statements therein not misleading, or (d) the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, as of its date or as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that with respect to each of clauses (a)-(d), such counsel need not express an opinion or belief with respect to the financial statements, schedules and other financial and accounting data included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus.

EXHIBIT B OPINION OF GIBSON DUNN & CRUTCHER LLP 1. The Securities, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms. 2. The Indenture constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms. 3. The issuance of the Securities and the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities do not violate, or require any filing with or approval of any governmental authority or regulatory body of the State of New York or the United States of America under, any law or regulation of the State of New York or the United States of America applicable to the Company that, in our experience, is generally applicable to transactions in the nature of those contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement. This paragraph 3 does not include any opinion regarding any federal or state securities or Blue Sky laws or regulations. 4.

This paragraph 4 does not include any opinion regarding any federal or state securities or Blue Sky laws or regulations. 5. The Company is not, and immediately after giving effect to the offering of the Securities and the application of the proceeds therefrom as contemplated by the Prospectus will not be, an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 6. Such counsel shall state that such counsel believes that the Indenture and the Securities conform in all material respects with the descriptions thereof contained in the Prospectus.
7.

(a) The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly: (1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of the Company's or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries' Equity Interests (including, without limitation, any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) or to the direct or indirect holders of the Company's or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries' Equity Interests in their capacity as such (other than dividends or distributions payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company or to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company); 31

(c) The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the fair market value on the date of the Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any assets or securities that are required to be valued by this 34
Section 3.03 will be determined, in the case of amounts greater than $10.0 million but less than $75.0 million, by an officer of the Company and, in the case of $75.0 million or more, by the Board of Directors of the Company. Section 3.04. Limitation On Incurrence Of Indebtedness And Issuance Of Preferred Stock. (a) The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect to (collectively, "INCUR") any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), and the Company will not issue any Disqualified Stock and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock; provided, however, that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or the Company may issue Disqualified Stock, if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company's most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock is issued would have been at least 2.0 to 1, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred or Disqualified Stock had been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of such four-quarter period. (b) Paragraph (a) of this Section 3.04 will not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following items of Indebtedness (collectively, "PERMITTED DEBT"): (1) the incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness and letters of credit under any Credit Facilities to which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary is a party in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding under this clause (1) (with letters of credit being deemed to have a principal amount equal to the undrawn face amount thereof) not to exceed $1.3 billion; (2) the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of the Existing Indebtedness; (3) the incurrence by the Company of Indebtedness represented by the Notes issued on the date hereof; (4) the incurrence by the Company and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness represented by Capital Lease Obligations, mortgage financings or purchase money obligations, in each case, incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or cost of construction or improvement of property, plant or equipment used in the business of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $50.0 million at any time outstanding; 35
(5) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to refund, refinance or replace Indebtedness (other than intercompany Indebtedness), including Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to finance the purchase price of the replacement properties, that was permitted to be incurred under paragraph (a) of this Section 3.04 or clauses (2), (3), (4) or (5) of this paragraph (b); (6) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of intercompany Indebtedness between or among the Company and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; provided, however, that (a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such Indebtedness being held by a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company and (b) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is not either the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that was not permitted by this clause (6); (7) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of Hedging Obligations; (8) the Guarantee by the Company of Indebtedness of any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that was permitted to be incurred by another provision of this Section 3.04; (9) Indebtedness in respect of bankers acceptances, letters of credit and performance or surety bonds issued for the account of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business in amounts and for the purposes customary in the Company's industry, in each case only to the extent that such incurrence does not result in the incurrence of any obligation to repay any borrowed money; (10) Indebtedness arising from any agreement providing for indemnities, Guarantees, purchase price adjustments, holdbacks, contingency payment obligations based on the performance of the acquired or disposed assets or similar obligations (other than Guarantees of Indebtedness) incurred by any Person in connection with the acquisition or disposition of assets; (11) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Acquired Debt if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company's most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date of incurrence of Acquired Debt (the "RELEVANT FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO") determined immediately after giving effect to such incurrence and the related acquisition (including through a merger, consolidation or otherwise) is higher than the Relevant 36
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio determined immediately before giving effect to such incurrence and the related acquisition; and (12) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of additional Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) at any time outstanding, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance or replace any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (12), not to exceed $250.0 million. (c) If any Non-Recourse Debt of an Unrestricted Subsidiary shall at any time cease to constitute Non-Recourse Debt or such Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be redesignated a Restricted Subsidiary, such event will be deemed to constitute an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary. (d) For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 3.04: (1) in the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (12) of paragraph (b) above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 3.04, the Company will be permitted to classify (or later classify or reclassify in whole or in part in its sole discretion) such item of Indebtedness in any manner that complies with this Section 3.04; (2) the accrual of interest, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, and the payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified Stock for purposes of this Section 3.04; provided, in each such case, that the amount thereof is included in the computation of Fixed Charges of the Company as accrued; and (3) for the purposes of determining compliance with any dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, the dollar-equivalent principal amount of such Indebtedness incurred pursuant thereto shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date that such Indebtedness was incurred. Section 3.05. Limitation On Liens. The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any Lien of any kind securing Indebtedness, Attributable Debt or trade payables (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of their property or assets, now owned or hereafter acquired, unless the Notes and all payments due under the Indenture with respect to the Notes are secured on an equal and ratable basis with the obligations so secured until such 37
time as such obligations are no longer secured by a Lien or, in the case of any obligation so secured that is expressly subordinated to the Notes, by a Lien prior to any Liens securing any and all obligations thereby secured for so long as any such obligations shall be so secured. Section 3.06. Limitation On Dividend And Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries. (a) The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to: (1) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or pay any indebtedness owed to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; (2) make loans or advances to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or (3) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of: (1) agreements governing Existing Indebtedness and the Credit Facilities in effect on June 1, 2003 and other customary encumbrances and restrictions existing on or after the date hereof that are not more restrictive in any material respect, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in such agreements on June 1, 2003 (provided that the application of such restrictions and encumbrances to additional Restricted Subsidiaries not subject thereto on June 1, 2003 shall not be deemed to make such restrictions and encumbrances more restrictive); (2) the Indenture and the Notes and other customary encumbrances and restrictions existing in indentures and notes after the date hereof that are not more restrictive, in any material respect, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in the Indenture; (3) applicable law (including without limitation, rules, regulations and agreements with regulatory authorities); (4) any instrument governing Indebtedness or Capital Stock of a Person acquired by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of such acquisition (except to the extent such Indebtedness or Capital Stock was incurred in connection with or in contemplation of such 38
acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired; provided that, in the case of Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was permitted by the terms of the Indenture to be incurred; (5) customary non-assignment provisions in leases entered into in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices; (6) Capital Lease Obligations, mortgage financings or purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of business that impose restrictions on that property of the nature described in clause (3) of paragraph (a) of this Section 3.06; (7) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of a Restricted Subsidiary that restricts distributions by that Restricted Subsidiary pending its sale or other disposition; (8) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements governing such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness are no more restrictive in any material respect, taken as a whole, than those contained in the agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced; (9) Liens securing Indebtedness otherwise permitted to be incurred under the provisions of Section 3.05 hereof that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets subject to such Liens; (10) provisions with respect to the disposition or distribution of assets or property in joint venture agreements, asset sale agreements, stock sale agreements and other similar agreements; provided that such restrictions apply only to the assets or property subject to such joint venture or similar agreement or to the assets or property being sold, as the case may be; and (11) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business. Section 3.07. Repurchase Of Notes Upon A Change Of Control. (a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this Section, not later than 30 days following a Change of Control, the Company will make a Change of Control Offer to purchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price (the "CHANGE OF CONTROL PAYMENT") equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase; provided that the Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth herein applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the 39
Company and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer. (b) Prior to complying with any of the provisions of this Section, but in any event within 30 days following a Change of Control, if the Company is subject to any agreement evidencing Indebtedness (or commitments to extend Indebtedness) that prohibits prepayment or repurchase of the Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, the Company will either repay all such outstanding Indebtedness of the Company (and terminate all commitments to extend such Indebtedness), or obtain the requisite consents, if any, under all agreements governing such Indebtedness or commitments to permit the repurchase of Notes required by paragraph (a) of this Section 3.07. The Company shall first comply with this paragraph (b) before it shall be required to make a Change of Control Offer or to repurchase Notes pursuant to paragraph (a). The Company's failure to comply with paragraph (b) may (with notice and lapse of time) constitute an Event of Default under Section 4.02 (a)(iv) but shall not constitute an Event of Default under Section 4.02(a)(iii). (c) The Company will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date. Section 3.08. Limit On Asset Sales. (a) The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless: (1) the Company (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value of the assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; (2) for any agreement to make an Asset Sale that is entered into after the date hereof, the fair market value is determined by (a) an executive officer of the Company if the value is more than $10 million but less than $75 million or (b) the Company's Board of Directors if the value is $75 million or more, as evidenced by a Board Resolution; and (3) at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents. For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash: (a) any liabilities, as shown on the Company's or such Restricted Subsidiary's most recent balance sheet, of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to a customary novation agreement that releases the Company or such Subsidiary from further liability; 40
(b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are contemporaneously, subject to ordinary settlement periods, converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash, to the extent of the cash received in that conversion; and (c) property or assets received as consideration for such Asset Sale that would otherwise constitute a permitted application of Net Proceeds (or other cash in such amount) under clauses (2), (3) or (4) under paragraph (b) of this Section 3.08. (b) Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may apply an amount of cash equal to the amount of such Net Proceeds at its option: (1) to repay or prepay senior Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; (2) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or a majority of the Voting Stock of, another Permitted Business; (3) to make a capital expenditure; or (4) to acquire other long-term assets that are used or useful in a Permitted Business. (c) Subject to paragraph (e) of this Section 3.08, to the extent that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries do not apply an amount of cash equal to the amount of such Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale during such period as provided in paragraph (b) of this Section 3.08, the amount not so applied (excluding Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale to the extent of the amount of acquisitions or capital expenditures described under clauses (2), (3) or (4) paragraph (b) of this Section 3.08 made during the 365 days preceding the receipt of such Net Proceeds (other than any portion of such amount that was funded with Net Proceeds of any other Asset Sale or that has been allocated to exclude Net Proceeds of any other Asset Sales under this Section 3.08)) will constitute "EXCESS PROCEEDS." When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $20.0 million, the Company will make an Asset Sale Offer to all Holders of Notes and all holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Notes containing provisions similar to those set forth in this Section 3.08 with respect to offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Company may use those Excess 41
Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other pari passu Indebtedness tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds will be allocated by the Company to Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness on a pro rata basis (based upon the respective principal amounts of the Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness tendered into such Asset Sale Offer) and the portion of each Note to be purchased will thereafter be determined by the Trustee on a pro rata basis among the Holders of such Notes with appropriate adjustments such that the Notes may only be purchased in integral multiples of $1,000. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero. (d) The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this Section 3.08, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations hereunder by virtue of such conflict. (e) Prior to making any Asset Sale Offer, but in any event within 30 days following the date on which such Asset Sale Offer would otherwise be required, if the Company is subject to any agreement evidencing Indebtedness (or commitments to extend Indebtedness) that prohibits prepayment or repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer, the Company will either repay all such outstanding Indebtedness of the Company (and terminate all commitments to extend such Indebtedness) or obtain the requisite consents, if any, under all agreements governing such Indebtedness or commitments to permit the repurchase of Notes required by this Section 3.08. The Company shall first comply with this paragraph (e) before it shall be required to make an Asset Sale Offer or to repurchase Notes pursuant to this Section 3.08. The Company's failure to comply with this paragraph (e) may (with notice and lapse of time) constitute an Event of Default under Section 4.02(a)(iv) but shall not constitute an Event of Default under Section 4.02(a)(iii). (f) In the event that, pursuant to this Section 3.08, the Company is required to commence an Asset Sale Offer, it shall follow the procedures specified below. The Asset Sale Offer shall be made to all Holders of Notes and to all holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Notes to the extent set forth above in this Section 3.08. The Asset Sale Offer will remain open for a period of at least 20 Business Days following its commencement and not more than 30 Business Days, except to the extent that a longer period is required by applicable law (the "OFFER PERIOD"). No later than three Business Days after the termination of the Offer Period (the "PURCHASE DATE"), the Company shall apply 42
all Excess Proceeds (the "OFFER AMOUNT") to the purchase of Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness (on a pro rata basis, if applicable, as set forth above in this Section 3.08) or, if less than the Offer Amount has been tendered, all Notes and other Indebtedness tendered in response to the Asset Sale Offer. Upon the commencement of an Asset Sale Offer, the Company will send, by first class mail, a notice to the Trustee and each of the Holders of the Notes. The notice will contain all instructions and materials necessary to enable such Holders to tender Notes pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer. The notice, which will govern the terms of the Asset Sale Offer, will state: (1) that the Asset Sale Offer is being made pursuant to this Section 3.08 and the length of time the Asset Sale Offer will remain open; (2) the Offer Amount, the purchase price and the Purchase Date; (3) that any Note not tendered or accepted for payment will continue to accrue interest; (4) that, unless the Company defaults in making such payment, any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Purchase Date; (5) that Holders electing to have a Note purchased pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer may elect to have Notes purchased in integral multiples of $1,000 only; (6) that Holders electing to have a Note purchased pursuant to any Asset Sale Offer will be required to surrender the Note, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" attached to the Note completed, or transfer its interest in such Note by book-entry transfer, to the Company, a depositary, if appointed by the Company, or a paying agent at the address specified in the notice at least three Business Days before the Purchase Date; (7) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the Company, the depositary or the applicable paying agent, as the case may be, receives, not later than the expiration of the Offer Period, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the Note the Holder delivered for purchase and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have such Note purchased; (8) that, if the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other pari passu Indebtedness surrendered by Holders exceeds the Offer Amount, the Company will select the Notes and other pari passu 43
Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the principal amount of Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness surrendered (with such adjustments as may be deemed appropriate so that only Notes in denominations of $1,000, or integral multiples thereof, will be purchased); and (9) that Holders whose Notes were purchased only in part will be issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered (or transferred by book-entry transfer). On or before the Purchase Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Offer Amount of Notes or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer, or if less than the Offer Amount has been tendered, all Notes tendered, and shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Company in accordance with the terms of this Section 3.08. The Company, the depositary or the applicable paying agent, as the case may be, shall promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after the Purchase Date) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes tendered by such Holder and accepted by the Company for purchase, and the Company shall promptly issue a new Note, and the Trustee, upon written request from the Company will authenticate and mail or deliver such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered. Any Note not so accepted shall be promptly mailed or delivered by the Company to the Holder thereof. The Company will publicly announce the results of the Asset Sale Offer on the Purchase Date. Section 3.09. Limitation On Transactions With Affiliates. (a) The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate (each, an "AFFILIATE TRANSACTION"), unless: (1) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person; and (2) the Company delivers to the Trustee: (a) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of $50 million, a resolution of the Company's Board of Directors set forth in an 44
Officers' Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with this Section 3.09 and that such Affiliate Transaction has been approved by a majority of the disinterested members of such Board of Directors; and (b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of $75 million, an opinion as to the fairness to the Company of such Affiliate Transaction from a financial point of view issued by an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national standing. (b) The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to the provisions of paragraph (a): (1) any employment agreement on customary terms entered into by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary; (2) transactions between or among the Company and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries; (3) transactions with a Person that is an Affiliate of the Company solely because the Company owns an Equity Interest in, or controls, such Person; (4) payment of reasonable directors fees and provision to directors, officers and employees of customary indemnities and customary benefits pursuant to employee benefit plans and similar arrangements; (5) sales of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) to Affiliates of the Company; (6) (A) corporate sharing agreements among the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to tax sharing and general overhead and other administrative matters and (B) any other intercompany arrangements disclosed or described in the Company's report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 (including the exhibits thereto) or the prospectus relating to the offering of the Notes, all as in effect on the date hereof, and any amendment or replacement of any of the foregoing so long as such amendment or replacement agreement is not less advantageous to the Company in any material respect than the agreement so amended or replaced, as such agreement was in effect on the date hereof; (7) transactions entered into as part of a Permitted Receivables Financing; and (8) Restricted Payments that are permitted by the provisions of Section 3.03 hereof. 45
Section 3.10. Designation Of Restricted And Unrestricted Subsidiaries. The Board of Directors of the Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default; provided that in no event will the material businesses currently operated by Williams Production Holdings LLC or Williams Gas Pipeline Company LLC be transferred to or held by an Unrestricted Subsidiary. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate fair market value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary properly designated will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under any applicable provision of Section 3.03 or Permitted Investments, as determined by the Company. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Board of Directors of the Company may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if the redesignation would not cause a Default. Section 3.11. Limitation On Sale And Leaseback Transactions. The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, enter into any Sale and Leaseback Transaction; provided that the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may enter into a Sale and Leaseback Transaction if: (1) the Company could have incurred Indebtedness in an amount equal to the Attributable Debt relating to such Sale and Leaseback Transaction under the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test in Section 3.04(a) hereof; (2) immediately after giving effect to such Sale and Leaseback Transaction, the aggregate outstanding Attributable Debt with respect to all Sale and Leaseback Transactions by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries does not exceed 10% of the Consolidated Net Tangible Assets of the Company; and (3) the gross cash proceeds of such Sale and Leaseback Transaction are at least equal to the fair market value, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors and set forth in an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee, of the property that is the subject of that Sale and Leaseback Transaction; provided, however, that the foregoing clauses (1) and (2) shall no longer be applicable after any Investment Grade Date. Section 3.12. Business Activities. The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any business other than Permitted Businesses, except to such extent as would not be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Section 3.13. Payments For Consent. The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any 46
consideration to or for the benefit of any Holder of Notes for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture or the Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all Holders of the Notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement. Section 3.14. Limitation On Mergers, Consolidations And Sales Of Assets. (a) The Company may not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not the Company is the surviving Person); or (2) sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person unless: (1) either: (A) The Company is the surviving Person; or (B) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made is a Person organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia; (2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made expressly assumes by supplemental indenture in form satisfactory to the Trustee all the obligations of the Company under the Notes and the Indenture and delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the supplemental indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such Person and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of such Person, enforceable against such Person in accordance with its terms (subject to customary exceptions); (3) immediately after such transaction no Default or Event of Default exists; and (4) the Company or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company), or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made will, on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in paragraph (a) of Section 3.04 hereof, provided, however, that this clause (4) shall no longer be applicable from and after any Investment Grade Date. 47
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may not, directly or indirectly, lease all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related transactions, to any other Person. (c) Clause (4) of paragraph (a) above will not apply to a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of assets between or among the Company and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries. Section 3.15. Covenant Termination. From and after the first date after the date hereof on which the Notes have an Investment Grade Rating from both Rating Agencies and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Notes (the "INVESTMENT GRADE DATE"), the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will no longer be subject to Sections 3.03, 3.04, 3.06, 3.08, 3.09 and 3.12 hereof. The Company shall give the Trustee prompt notice in an Officers' Certificate of the occurrence of the Investment Grade Date. ARTICLE 4 EVENTS OF DEFAULT Section 4.01. Applicability Of Events Of Default. Sections 5.1 and 5.10 of the Base Indenture will not be applicable to the Notes. Instead, the provisions of Section 4.02 to 4.04 will apply to extent specified therein. Any reference in the Base Indenture to Section 5.1 or 5.10 thereof shall be deemed for purposes of the Notes to be a reference to Section 4.02, 4.03 or 4.04, as applicable, of this Ninth Supplemental Indenture. Section 4.02. Events Of Default Defined. (a) Each of the following shall be an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. (i) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on the Notes; (ii) default in payment when due of the principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes; (iii) failure by the Company to purchase Notes tendered pursuant to an offer described under Sections 3.07 or 3.08 hereof in accordance with the terms thereof, or failure of the Company to comply with the provisions of Section 3.14 hereof; (iv) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for 60 days after notice, from the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% of the 48
outstanding principal amount of the Notes, to comply with any of the other agreements in the Indenture; (v) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof, if that default: (A) is caused by a failure of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to pay principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness on the date of such default (a "PAYMENT DEFAULT"); or (B) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity, and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $50 million or more; (vi) failure by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of $50 million, which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days; (vii) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (A) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (B) a decree or order adjudging the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) under any applicable Federal or State law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) or of any substantial part of the property of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of the affairs of the Company or any of its Significant 49
Subsidiaries (or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or (viii) the commencement by the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable Federal or State law, or the consent by it to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or similar official of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) or of any substantial part of the property of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of corporate action by the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) in furtherance of any such action. (b) The Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of a Default or Event of Default or of the identity of a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) unless a Responsible Officer assigned to the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee has actual knowledge of such Default or Event of Default or of the identity of such Significant Subsidiary or the Trustee receives written notice at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee of such Default or Event of Default or of the identity of such Significant Subsidiary with specific reference to such Default or Event of Default or Significant Subsidiary and the Notes and this Indenture. (c) When a Default is cured, or when an Event of Default is deemed cured pursuant to Section 4.04 hereof, such Default, or Event of Default, as the case may be, ceases. 50
(d) A Default under clause (iv) of this Section 4.02 will not be an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then Outstanding notify the Company of the Default and the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified after receipt of such notice. Such notice must specify the Default and state that it is a "Notice of Default". Any such notice given by Holders shall also be given to the Trustee. Section 4.03. Acceleration. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (vii) or (viii) of Section 4.02(a) hereof with respect to the Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then Outstanding Notes by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal of and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all then Outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. Upon any such declaration, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all then Outstanding Notes shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in clause (vii) or (viii) of Section 4.02(a) occurs with respect to the Company, the principal of and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all Notes then Outstanding shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration, notice or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Notes has been made and before a judgment for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as provided in Article Five of the Base Indenture, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if: (i) all existing Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes that have become due solely by the declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived, and (ii) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereon. If the maturity of the Notes is accelerated pursuant to this Section 4.03, 100% of the principal amount thereof shall become due and payable plus premium, if any, and accrued interest, if any, to the date of payment. In the case of any Event of Default occurring by reason of any willful action or inaction taken or not taken by or on behalf of the Company with the intention of 51
avoiding payment of the premium (including, in the case of any such Event of Default prior to June 1, 2007, payment of the Make-Whole Price) that the Company would have had to pay if the Company then had elected to redeem the Notes pursuant to Section 2.06 hereof, an equivalent premium (or, in the case of any such Event of Default prior to June 1, 2007, the relevant Make-Whole Amount that would apply at such time if the Notes were optionally redeemed at the Make-Whole Price) will also become and be immediately due and payable to the extent permitted by law upon the acceleration of the Notes. Section 4.04. Waiver Of Existing Defaults. Subject to Sections 5.7 and 8.2 of the Base Indenture, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences (including waivers obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes or a solicitation of consents in respect of the Notes), except (1) a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest on, or the principal of, the Notes or (2) a continuing default in respect of a provision that under Section 8.2 of the Base Indenture cannot be amended without the consent of each Holder affected. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Section 4.05. Conflict with Base Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any notice, direction, waiver, rescission or cancellation is given with respect to a Default or Event of Default that, under the terms of the Base Indenture, requires action by holders of a percentage of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes and one or more other series of Securities issued under the Base Indenture, voting together or otherwise as a single class, then such notice, direction, waiver, rescission or cancellation shall be effective only if effected with the requisite percentage of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes and any other such Securities, voting together or otherwise as a single class. ARTICLE 5 EXECUTION OF NOTES Section 5.01. Execution of Notes. The Notes shall be executed as follows: Notwithstanding Section 2.5 of the Base Indenture, the Notes shall be signed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, its President, one of its Vice Presidents or its Treasurer, and its corporate seal may, but need not, be impressed, affixed, imprinted or otherwise reproduced thereon, and may, but need not, be attested. Such signatures may be the manual or facsimile signatures of the present or any future such officers. If any Note is executed under the Company's corporate seal, such seal may be in the form of a facsimile thereof. Typographical 52
and other minor errors or defects in any such reproduction of the seal or any such signature shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any Note that has been duly authenticated and delivered by the Trustee. In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the Notes shall cease to be such officer before the Note so signed shall be authenticated and delivered by the Trustee or disposed of by the Company, such Note nevertheless may be authenticated and delivered or disposed of as though the person who signed such Note had not ceased to be such officer of the Company; and any Note may be signed on behalf of the Company by such persons as, at the actual date of the execution of such Note, shall be the proper officers of the Company, although at the date of the execution and delivery of this Ninth Supplemental Indenture any such person was not such an officer. ARTICLE 6 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS Section 6.01. Ratification. The Indenture, as supplemented and amended by this Ninth Supplemental Indenture, is in all respects hereby adopted, ratified and confirmed. Section 6.02. Counterparts. This Ninth Supplemental Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed an original; and all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. Section 6.03. Governing Law. THIS NINTH SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE AND EACH NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CHOICE OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF. Section 6.04. No Recitals, etc. The recitals contained herein shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Ninth Supplemental Indenture. Section 6.05. Paying Agent. The Trustee is hereby appointed paying agent for the Notes. Section 6.06. Liability Of Incorporators, Stockholders, etc. Section 11.1 of the Base Indenture will not be applicable to the Notes. Instead, the following provisions will apply: No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Company or any Subsidiary, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Notes or the Indenture, or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each 53
Holder of the Notes by accepting a Note will be deemed to have waived and released all such liability. Such waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. 54

The Company may, from time to time, without the consent of the existing holders of the Notes, issue additional notes under the Indenture having the same terms as the Notes in all respects, except for issue date, issue price, initial interest accrual date and the initial Interest Payment Date. Any such additional notes will be consolidated with and form a single series with the Notes under the Indenture. At any time and from time to time prior to June 1, 2007, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at the Make-Whole Price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. "Make-Whole Amount" with respect to a Note means an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the present value of the remaining interest, premium and principal payments due on such Note (excluding any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points, over (2) the outstanding principal amount of such Note. "Make-Whole Average Life" means the number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth) between the redemption date and the Stated Maturity of the Notes. "Make-Whole Price" means the sum of the Outstanding principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus the Make-Whole Amount for such Notes. A-4
"Treasury Rate" is defined as the yield to maturity (calculated on a semi-annual bond-equivalent basis) at the time of the computation of United States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled by and published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519), which has become publicly available at least two Business Days prior to the date of the redemption notice or, if such Statistical Release is no longer published, any publicly available source of similar market data) most nearly equal to the then remaining maturity of the Notes; provided that if the Make-Whole Average Life of such Note is not equal to the constant maturity of the United States Treasury security for which a weekly average yield is given, the Treasury Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of United States Treasury securities for which such yields are given, except that if the Make-Whole Average Life of such Note is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used. At any time and from time to time on or after June 1, 2007, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the percentage of their principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on June 1 of the years indicated below: At any time and from time to time prior to June 1, 2006, the Company may, at its option, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net cash proceeds received by the Company from any Equity Offering (as defined in the Indenture) at a redemption price equal to 108.625% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date; provided that (1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 120 days after the closing of the related Equity Offering, and (2) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption (excluding Notes held by the Company and its Subsidiaries). This Note may be the subject of a Change of Control Offer and/or an Asset Sale Offer, each as further described in the Indenture. If the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations sufficient to pay the then Outstanding principal of, premium, if any, A-5
and accrued interest on the Notes to the redemption date or the Maturity Date of the Notes, as the case may be, the Company may in certain circumstances specified in the Indenture be discharged from the Indenture and the Notes or may be discharged from certain of its obligations under the Indenture. Periodic interest installments with respect to which the Interest Payment Date is on or prior to any Redemption Date will be payable to Holders of record at the close of business on the relevant record dates referred to herein, all as provided in the Indenture. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at his registered address. Notes in denominations larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part but only in whole multiples of $1,000. On or after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on Notes or on the portions thereof called for redemption, as the case may be. In case an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture. The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series issued under the Indenture then Outstanding and affected, voting as one class, to add any provisions to, or change in any manner or eliminate any of the provisions of, such Indenture or modify in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series so affected; provided that the Company and the Trustee may not, without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Security affected thereby, (i) extend the final maturity of the principal of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce the amount payable on redemption thereof or change the currency in which the principal thereof (including any amount in respect of original issues discount) or interest thereon is payable or reduce the amount of any original issue discount security payable upon acceleration or provable in bankruptcy or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on any Security when due or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage in principal amount of Securities of any series issued under such Indenture, the consent of the Holders of which is required for any such modification. It is also provided in the Indenture that, with respect to certain defaults or Events of Default regarding the Securities of any series, prior to any declaration accelerating the maturity of such Securities, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount Outstanding of the Securities of such series (or, in the case of certain defaults or Events of Default, all or certain series of the Securities) may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series A-6
(or, in the case of certain defaults or Events of Default, all or certain series of the Securities, as the case may be) waive any such past default or Event of Default and its consequences. The preceding sentence shall not, however, apply to a default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any of the Securities. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and any Notes which may be issued in exchange or substitution herefor or on registration of transfer hereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Note or such other Notes. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note in the manner, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed. The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any multiple of $1,000 at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, and in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, but without the payment of any service charge, Notes may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations. Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor, subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith. The Company, the Trustee and any authorized agent of the Company or the Trustee may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon), for the purpose of receiving payment of, or on account of, the principal hereof and subject to the provisions on the face hereof, interest hereon, and for all other purposes, and none of the Company, the Trustee or any authorized agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Company or any Subsidiary, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Notes or the Indenture, or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of the Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. A-7
This Note shall for all purposes be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. Terms used herein which are defined in the Indenture shall have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Indenture. A-8
