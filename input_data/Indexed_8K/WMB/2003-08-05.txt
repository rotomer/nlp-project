EXHIBIT 99.1 (WILLIAMS(R) LOGO) NEWSRELEASE NYSE: WMB - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- DATE: Aug. 1, 2003 WILLIAMS AGREES TO END POWER CONTRACT IN EXCHANGE FOR $128 MILLION TULSA, Okla. - Williams (NYSE:WMB) announced today it has agreed to terminate a long-term power contract with Allegheny Energy, Inc. (NYSE:AYE) subsidiary Allegheny Energy Supply Company, LLC, for cash consideration of $128 million payable to Williams. "This deal is consistent with our strategy to monetize the contracts in our trading book," said Steve Malcolm, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Ending this power-supply arrangement will reduce credit risk specific to this contract and return good value on the position." The agreement is subject to certain conditions, including a provision that Allegheny successfully completes the sale of its energy supply agreement with the California Department of Water Resources. Allegheny earlier this week announced an agreement with a third-party for its CDWR contract. Williams is scheduled to receive $100 million upon closing of Allegheny's CDWR contract sale and another $28 million over the following 12 months. Williams' contract to supply up to 1,000 megawatts of power to Allegheny was scheduled to expire in 2018. Williams now expects to terminate the contract upon payment in full from Allegheny.
