Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure.
     On April 26, 2004, Williams obtained an additional five-year, $100 million unsecured credit facility from Citigroup. Williams plans to use this facility primarily for issuing letters of credit. Williams was able to obtain the new unsecured credit facility through Citigroup's ability to syndicate the associated credit risk into the institutional investor market via a 144A offering. The facility is incremental to Williams' traditional bank capacity with its current lender group.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Williams has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
