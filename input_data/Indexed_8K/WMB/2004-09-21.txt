Item 3.03. Material Modifications to Rights of Security Holders.
On September 21, 2004, The Williams Companies, Inc. (the "Company"), pursuant to approval by the Company's Board of Directors, entered into an Amended and Restated Rights Agreement with EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., as Rights Agent ("EquiServe").

The Amended and Restated Rights Agreement amends and restates the Rights Agreement dated February 6, 1996 between the Company and EquiServe, as successor in interest to First Chicago Trust Company of New York. The Amended and Restated Rights Agreement affects the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company. The Amended and Restated Rights Agreement was amended to (i) extend the term of the prior Rights Agreement from February 6, 2006 to September 21, 2014; (ii) eliminate the "Adverse Person" concept; (iii) reset the exercise price to $50 per share; and (iv) broaden the Board of Directors' ability to exempt inadvertent triggers that result sole ly from the existence of a "group" among major stockholders. A copy of the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement is attached as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
Effective September 15, 2004, the Company's Board of Directors amended the Company's By-laws to (i) delete the provision in Article II Section 3 (Special Meetings) that allowed the stockholders owning of record at least a majority in number of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote to call a Special Meeting of Stockholders and (ii) require in Article IX Section 1 (Amendments of By-Laws) an affirmative vote of the holders of 75 percent of the voting power of all shares of outstanding stock of the Company to alter, amend, supplement or repeal and adopt new By-laws. A copy of the Company's By-laws is attached as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

To be timely, a Stockholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding Annual Meeting of Stockholders; , , that in the event that the Annual Meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the Stockholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the Annual Meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the Annual Meeting was made, whichever first occurs.
provided
however
To be in proper written form, a Stockholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth as to each matter such Stockholder proposes to bring before the Annual Meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the Annual Meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the Annual Meeting, (ii) the name and record address of such Stockholder, (iii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Company which are owned beneficially or of record by such Stockholder, (iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such Stockholder and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such business by such Stockholder and any material interest of such Stockholder in such business and (v) a representation that such Stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting to bring such business before the meeting.

Except as provided in Section 2 of this Article III, the Directors to be elected at each Annual Meeting of Stockholders shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at such Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and each Director so elected shall hold office until the third Annual Meeting of Stockholders following such election and until a successor is duly elected and qualified, or until earlier resignation or removal. Any Director may resign at any time upon notice to the Company. Directors need not be stockholders.
Section 1.
Number, Nomination, and Election of Directors
Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any Preferred Stock, as may at any time be provided in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or in any resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors establishing any such Preferred Stock, shall have the right, voting as a class or as classes, to elect Directors at any Annual or Special Meeting of Stockholders, the then authorized number of Directors of the Company may be increased by such number as may therein be provided, and at such meeting the holders of such Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect the additional Directors as therein provided. Any Directors so elected, unless so reelected at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders or Special Meeting held in place thereof, next succeeding the time when the holders of any such Preferred Stock became entitled to elect Directors as above provided, shall not hold office beyond such Annual or Special Meeting. Any such provision for election of Directors by holders of the Preferred Stock shall apply notwithstanding the maximum number of Directors set forth in the provisions hereinabove.
Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as Directors of the Company, except as may be otherwise provided in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation with respect to the right of holders of preferred stock of the Company to nominate and elect a specified number of Directors in certain circumstances. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at any Annual Meeting of Stockholders, or at any Special Meeting of Stockholders called for the purpose of electing Directors, (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or (b) by any Stockholder of the Company (i) who is a Stockholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 9 and on the record date for the determination of Stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting and (ii) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 9.
In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination to be made by a Stockholder, such Stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Company.
To be timely, a Stockholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company (a) in the case of an Annual Meeting, not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding Annual Meeting of Stockholders; provide however, that in the event that the Annual Meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the Stockholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the Annual Meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the Annual Meeting was made, whichever first occurs; and (b) in the case of a Special Meeting of Stockholders called for the purpose of electing Directors, not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which notice of the date of the Special meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of the Special meeting was made, whichever first occurs.
To be in proper written form, a Stockholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth (a) as to each person whom the Stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a Director (i) the name, age, business address and residence address of the person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of the person, (iii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Company which are owned beneficially or of record by the person and (iv) any other information relating to the person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of Directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; and (b) as to the Stockholder giving the notice (i) the name and record address of such Stockholder, (ii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Company which are owned beneficially or of record by such Stockholder, (iii) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such Stockholder and each proposed nominee and any other person or persons (including their names) pursuant to which the nominations are to be made by such Stockholder, (iv) a representation that such Stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the persons named in its notice and (v) any other information relating to such Stockholder that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of Directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Such notice must be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a Director if elected.
No person shall be eligible for election as a Director of the Company unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 9. If the Chairman of the meeting determines that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the Chairman shall declare to the meeting that the nomination was defective and such defective nomination shall be disregarded.
. Subject to the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of Directors may be filled by a majority of the Directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining Director, and the Directors so chosen shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the unexpired portion of the term of that directorship, and until their successors are duly elected and qualified, or until their earlier resignation or removal.
Section 2.
Vacancies
. The business of the Company shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors which may exercise all such powers of the Company and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-laws directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.

Section 5.
Quorum

Section 7.
Meetings by Means of Conference Telephone
. The Board of Directors may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the Directors. The Board of Directors may designate one or more Directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of any such committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, or in the By-laws of the Company, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Company, and may authorize the seal of the Company to be affixed to all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to the following matters: (i) approving or adopting, or recommending to the stockholders, any action or matter expressly required by Delaware law to be submitted to stockholders for approval; or (ii) adopting, amending or repealing any By-law of the Company. Each committee shall keep regular minutes and report to the Board of Directors when required.
Section 8.
Committees
. The Directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and such compensation for serving as a Director and attending each meeting of the Board of Directors as may be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board. No such payment shall preclude any Director from serving the Company in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees may also be paid such compensation for committee service or for attending committee meetings as the Board may establish from time to time.
Section 9.
Compensation
. The normal retirement date for a Director shall be at the first Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company following the Director's 72nd birthday, and except as provided in this Section 10, no one shall serve as a Director beyond this normal retirement date.

Nothing herein shall be construed to create a right of any Director to be nominated for reelection to the Board or as a limitation upon the right of the Board of Directors not to nominate any Director for such reelection.
Section 10.
Retirement Policy
. The officers shall be elected by the Board of Directors and shall include a President, a Secretary and a Treasurer and, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, may include a Chairman of the Board, one or more Vice Presidents and such other officers as the Board of Directors may from time to time deem necessary or appropriate.

The officers need not be stockholders nor, except in the case of the Chairman of the Board, need such officers be Directors.
Section 1.

Any vacancy occurring in any office shall be filled by the Board of Directors.
Section 2.
Election

The Board of Directors may, by resolution, from time to time confer like powers upon any other person or persons.
Section 3.
Voting Securities Owned by the Company
. If no Chairman of the Board has been elected, the President shall be the Chief Executive Officer. If a person has been elected as both Chairman of the Board and President, that person shall be the Chief Executive Officer. Otherwise, if a Chairman of the Board has been elected, the Board of Directors shall designate either the Chairman of the Board or the President as Chief Executive Officer. Subject to the directions of the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer shall direct the policy of the Company and shall have general direction of the Company's business, affairs and property and over its several officers, in addition to his duties set forth in Section 5 or 6 of this Article IV, as the case may be.

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful.
Section 1.
Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings Other Than Those by or in the Right of the Company
. Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the Company shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Company unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper.
Section 2.
Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company
. Any indemnification under this Article VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Company only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders. To the extent, however, that a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Company has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
Section 3.
Authorization of Indemnification
. For purposes of any determination under Section 3 of this Article VIII, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe such person's conduct was unlawful, if such person's action is based on the records or books of account of the Company or another enterprise, or on information supplied to such person by the officers of the Company or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Company or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Company or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Company or another enterprise. The term "another enterprise" as used in this Section 4 shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this Section 4 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections l or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be.
Section 4.
Good Faith Defined
. Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any Director, officer, employee or agent may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the Director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 shall be given to the Company promptly upon the filing of such application.
Section 5.
Indemnification by a Court
. Expenses by an officer or Director incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company as authorized in this Article VIII.
Section 6.
Expenses Payable in Advance
Such expenses incurred by other employees and agents shall be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.

The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any By-law, agreement, contract, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Company that indemnification of the persons specified in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article VIII shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Sections 1 or 2 of this Article VIII but whom the Company has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or otherwise.
Section 7.
Nonexclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses
. The Company may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Company would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article VIII.

Each of the Rights outstanding after such adjustment of the number of Rights shall be exercisable for the number of one two-hundredths of a share of Preferred Stock for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment. Each Right held of record prior to such adjustment of the number of Rights shall become that number of Rights (calculated to the nearest one one-thousandth of a Right) obtained by dividing the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to the adjustment of the Purchase Price by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after such adjustment of the Purchase Price. The Company shall promptly notify the Rights Agent in writing of any such election and shall make a public announcement of its election to adjust the number of Rights pursuant to this , indicating the record date for the adjustment and, if known at the time, the amount of the adjustment to be made. Such record date may be the date on which the Purchase Price is adjusted or any day thereafter, but, if separate Right Certificates have been issued, it shall be at least ten days after the date of such public announcement. If separate Right Certificates have been issued, upon each adjustment of the number of Rights pursuant to this , the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, cause Right Certificates representing the additional Rights to which such holders are entitled as a result of such adjustment to be distributed, subject to hereof, to holders of record of Right Certificates on such record date or, at the option of the Company, cause new Right Certificates representing all the Rights to which such holders are entitled after such adjustment to be distributed to such holders of record in substitution and replacement for the Right Certificates held by such holders prior to the date of such adjustment, and upon surrender thereof if required by the Company. Right Certificates to be so distributed shall be issued, executed and countersigned in the manner provided for herein (and may bear, at the option of the Company, the adjusted Purchase Price) and shall be registered in the names of the holders of record of Right Certificates on the record date specified in the public announcement.

Section 11(i)
Section 14
(j) Irrespective of any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price or the number of one two-hundredths of a share of Preferred Stock issuable upon the exercise of one Right, the Right Certificates theretofore and thereafter issued may continue to express the Purchase Price per one two-hundredth of a share of Preferred Stock and the number of shares of Preferred Stock issuable upon the exercise of one Right that were expressed in the initial Right Certificates issued hereunder.
(k) Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the Purchase Price below the then par value, if any, of the Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of the Rights, the Company shall take any corporate action that may, in the advice or opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable one two-hundredths of a share of Preferred Stock at such adjusted Purchase Price.
(l) In any case in which this shall require that an adjustment in the Purchase Price be made effective as of a record date for a specified event, the Company may elect to defer (with prompt written notice thereof to the Rights Agent), until the occurrence of such event, the issuance to the holder of any Right exercised after such record date of the number of one two-hundredths of a share of Preferred Stock and other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the number of one two-hundredths of a share of Preferred Stock and other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the Purchase Price in effect prior to such adjustment; , that the Company shall deliver to such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument representing such holder's right to receive such additional shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.

provided, however
(m) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this , the Company shall be entitled to make such further adjustments in the number of one two-hundredths of a share of Preferred Stock that may be purchased upon exercise of one Right, and such further adjustments in the Purchase Price, in addition to those adjustments expressly required by this , as and to the extent that the Company in its sole discretion shall determine to be advisable in order that any (i) consolidation or subdivision of the Preferred Stock, (ii) issuance wholly for cash of any Preferred Stock at less than the Current Market Price thereof, (iii) issuance wholly for cash of Preferred Stock or securities that by their terms are convertible into or exchangeable for Preferred Stock, (iv) dividends on Preferred Stock payable in Preferred Stock or (v) issuance of rights, options or warrants referred to in hereof, hereafter made by the Company to holders of its Preferred Stock shall not be taxable to such stockholders.

Successive adjustments shall be made pursuant to this each time such a dividend is paid or such a subdivision, combination or reclassification is effected. If an event occurs that would require an adjustment under both this and hereof, the adjustment provided for in this shall be in addition to, and shall be made prior to, any adjustment required pursuant to hereof.

a Triggering Event (as such term is defined in the Rights Agreement) that a number of Rights be exercised so that only whole shares of Preferred Stock will be issued.
Upon the occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event (as such term is defined in the Rights Agreement), if the Rights evidenced by this Rights Certificate are beneficially owned by (i) an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate of any such Acquiring Person (as such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement), (ii) a transferee of any such Acquiring Person, Associate or Affiliate, or (iii) under certain circumstances specified in the Rights Agreement, a transferee of a person who, after such transfer, became an Acquiring Person, or an Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring Person, such Rights shall become null and void and no holder hereof shall have any right with respect to such Rights from and after the occurrence of such Section 11(a)(ii) Event.
As provided in the Rights Agreement, the Purchase Price and the number and kind of shares of Preferred Stock or other securities, which may be purchased upon the exercise of the Rights evidenced by this Rights Certificate are subject to modification and adjustment upon the happening of certain events, including Triggering Events.
This Rights Certificate is subject to all of the terms, provisions and conditions of the Rights Agreement, which terms, provisions and conditions are hereby incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof and to which Rights Agreement reference is hereby made for a full description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities hereunder of the Rights Agent, the Company and the holders of the Rights Certificates, which limitations of rights include the temporary suspension of the exercisability of such Rights under the specific circumstances set forth in the Rights Agreement. Copies of the Rights Agreement are on file at the above-mentioned office of the Rights Agent and are also available upon written request to the Company.
This Rights Certificate, with or without other Rights Certificates, upon surrender at the principal office or offices of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose, may be exchanged for another Rights Certificate or Rights Certificates of like tenor and date evidencing Rights entitling the holder to purchase a like aggregate number of one two-hundredths of a share of Preferred Stock as the Rights evidenced by the Rights Certificate or Rights Certificates surrendered shall have entitled such holder to purchase. If this Rights Certificate shall be exercised in part, the holder shall be entitled to receive upon surrender hereof another Rights Certificate or Rights Certificates for the number of whole Rights not exercised.
Subject to the provisions of the Rights Agreement, the Rights evidenced by this Certificate may be redeemed by the Company at its option at a redemption price of $0.01 per Right at any time prior to the earlier of the close of business on (i) the tenth day following the Stock Acquisition Date (as such time period may be extended pursuant to the Rights Agreement), and (ii) the Rights Expiration Date. In addition, the Rights may be exchanged, in whole or in part, for shares of the Common Stock, or shares of preferred stock of the Company having essentially the same value or economic rights as such shares. Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Company authorizing any such exchange, and without any further action or any notice, the Rights (other than Rights which are not subject to such exchange) will terminate and the Rights will only enable holders to receive the shares issuable upon such exchange.
No fractional shares of Preferred Stock will be issued upon the exercise of any Right or Rights evidenced hereby (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one two-hundredth of a share of Preferred Stock, which may, at the election of the Company, be evidenced by depositary receipts), but in lieu thereof a cash payment will be made, as provided in the Rights Agreement.
No holder of this Rights Certificate shall be entitled to vote or receive dividends or be deemed for any purpose the holder of shares of Preferred Stock or of any other securities of the Company which may at any time be issuable on the exercise hereof, nor shall anything contained in the Rights Agreement or herein be construed to confer upon the holder hereof, as such, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action, or, to receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting stockholders (except as provided in the Rights Agreement), or to receive dividends or subscription rights, or otherwise, until the Right or Rights evidenced by this Rights Certificate shall have been exercised as provided in the Rights Agreement.
This Rights Certificate shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose until it shall have been countersigned by the Rights Agent.
