In addition, such opinion shall include a statement that such counsel believes that the statements in the Prospectus incorporated by reference from (A) Item 3 of Part I of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, as amended, (B) Item 1 of Part II of the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004, as amended, if applicable, and (C) Item 5 (or Item 8.01 with respect to reports filed on or after August 23, 2004) of the Company's Current Reports on Form 8-K, if any, filed since such Annual Report, insofar as such statements constitute summaries of legal matters and proceedings, present in all material respects an accurate summary of such legal matters or proceedings.

(i) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the Remarketing (A) will not violate any law or regulation of the State of New York or the United States of America applicable to the Company that, in such counsel's experience, is generally applicable to transactions in the nature of those contemplated by the Material Documents; and the Company has full power and authority to authorize and cause the Notes to be remarketed as contemplated by the Material Documents, and (B) except for such filings or approvals as already have been made or obtained under the Securities Act, do not require any filing with or approval of any governmental authority or regulatory body of the State of New York or the United States of America under any law or regulation of the State of New York or the United States of America applicable to the Company that, in such counsel's experience, is generally applicable to transactions in the nature of those contemplated by the Material Documents.

This paragraph does not include any opinion regarding state securities or "blue sky" laws or regulations.
(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Remarketing will not violate (A) the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company, (B) the terms of any Material Contract, or (C) any order, judgment or decree of any court or other agency of government identified to such counsel in an officers' certificate of the Company and attached to such opinion.

In addition, such opinion shall include a statement that such counsel has reviewed the order of the Commission advising that the Registration Statement became effective under the Securities Act on June 26, 2002 and that, to such counsel's knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the Securities Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened by the Commission.

Subject to the qualifications, exceptions, assumptions and limitations contained herein, we are of the opinion that, under current United States federal income tax law, although the discussion set forth in the Prospectus under the heading "MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES" does not purport to discuss all possible United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of Notes acquired in the Remarketing, such discussion constitutes, in all material respects, a fair and accurate summary of the United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of Notes acquired in the Remarketing.
(i) Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel to the Remarketing Agent, shall have furnished to the Remarketing Agent its written opinion, addressed to the Remarketing Agent and dated the Remarketing Closing Date, with respect to such matters as the Remarketing Agent may reasonably request, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Remarketing Agent.

Benefit of Agreement.

Governing Law.
13. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held or deemed to be or shall, in fact, be invalid, inoperative or unenforceable as applied in any particular case in any or all jurisdictions because it conflicts with any provisions of any constitution, statute, rule or public policy or for any other reason, then, to the extent permitted by law, such circumstances shall not have the effect of rendering the provision in question invalid, inoperative or unenforceable in any other case, circumstances or jurisdiction, or of rendering any other provision or provisions of this Agreement, as the case may be, invalid, inoperative or unenforceable to any extent whatsoever.
Severability.
14. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be regarded as an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same document.
