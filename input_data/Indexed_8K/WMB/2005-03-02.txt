Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On February 24, 2005, the Compensation Committee of The Williams Companies, Inc. ("Williams") Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") determined that under Williams 2004 annual incentive program Williams had exceeded the Economic Value Added incentive target established by the Compensation Committee in January 2004 and approved awards for eligible employees including $2,740,000 for Mr. Steven J. Malcolm, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; $680,000 for Mr. James J. Bender, Sr. Vice President and General Counsel; $1,096,000 for Mr. Donald R. Chappel, Sr. Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; $701,000 for Mr. Michael P. Johnson, Sr. Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer; and $696,000 for Mr. Phillip D. Wright, Sr. Vice President, Williams Gas Pipelines. The amount awarded to the other executive officers totaled $2,673,590. The awards include an amount to be reserved in excess of an established maximum cash payout under the annual incentive program. The reserved amount can be earned in future years if established performance targets are met, but is subject to loss if such performance targets are not met. On February 24, 2005, the Compensation Committee also determined that Williams had attained the performance target established in February 2004 for the vesting of the first one-third of the 2004 awards of performance-based deferred shares. Based on the Committees certification, such shares were vested as of February 25, 2005. The vested shares will be issued no earlier than at the end of five years from the February 2004 grant date, except in the event of death, disability or a change-in-control in which case the shares will be issued as soon as practicable after the event. As reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission on applicable Form 4s, Mr. Steven J. Malcolm, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and the other executive officers of the Company were granted such performance-based deferred shares in February 2004. On F ebruary 24, 2005, the Compensation Committee also approved 2005 equity awards including grants of stock options, time-based deferred shares and performance-based deferred shares for Mr. Steven J. Malcolm, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, the other executive officers and other eligible employees. The awards were granted on February 25, 2005. The equity awards to individuals subject to Section 16 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on applicable Form 4s. The stock options will vest in thirds over a three year period. The time-based deferred stock will vest at the end of a three year period. Recipients of the performance-based deferred shares will have the opportunity to vest in such shares at the end of a three year period if the recipient remains an active employee of the Company until March 15, 2008, and the Committee certifies that the Company has met the performance measure previously defined by the Committee. One-thir d of such shares are at risk for performance in each of the three years. If the performance is not met for any of the three years, the shares at risk for the year will not be eligible for vesting. In the event of death, disability or a change-in-control, any shares for which the Committee has certified performance and any shares at risk for future performance will be issued as soon as practicable after the event. The Compensation Committee also established an improvement in Economic Value Added as the target for the first year of the three year term. The 2005 equity awards were granted subject to the terms of the grant agreements, the form of which are filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1, Exhibit 99.2, and Exhibit 99.3 and incorporated by reference herein. Economic Value Added is a registered trademark of Stern, Stewart and Co.

You agree to accept as binding, conclusive and final all decisions and interpretations of the Committee upon any questions arising under the Plan, the Option Grant Letter or this Option Agreement.
Incorporation of Plan
3. . Except as otherwise provided in this Option Agreement or in the Option Grant Letter, you may exercise vested Options by providing notification in a form acceptable to the Company that you have elected to exercise this Option in whole or in part, showing the number of Shares for which the Option is being exercised, and providing payment in full for the Option Price. If you have not signed and delivered this Option Agreement prior to submitting a notification of such election, submission of your notification of election shall constitute your agreement with the terms and conditions of this Option Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Company reserves the right to require your signature to this Option Agreement prior to accepting a notification of election to exercise this Option in whole or in part.
Exercise and Payment
You must pay the Option Price in full by any one or more of the following methods, subject to approval of the Committee, (i) in cash by a broker-dealer to whom you have submitted an irrevocable exercise notice consisting of an irrevocable instruction to deliver promptly to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds sufficient to pay the Option Price; (ii) in cash, by check or wire transfer; (iii) in Mature Shares valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise; (iv) subject to restrictions established by the Committee, in Restricted Shares you have held for at least six months prior to the exercise of the Option, valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise; or (v) in any combination of the above methods.

Rights in the Event of Termination of Service
(ii) . If you die while in the service of the Company and its Affiliates, your Option will immediately vest and the Option shall remain exercisable for a period of five years from the date of your death (but may not be exercised later than the last day of the original Option Term) by the person who becomes entitled to exercise your Option after your death (whether by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, or by means of a written beneficiary designation you filed with the Stock Administration Department before your death).

Vesting of Deferred Stock
(a) Except as otherwise provided in Subparagraphs 4(b)  4(g) below, a Participant shall not vest in any shares of Deferred Stock unless the Participant remains an active employee of the Company or any of its parents, subsidiaries or affiliates until February 25, 2008 (the "Maturity Date").
(b) If a Participant dies prior to the Maturity Date while an active employee of the Company or any of its parents, subsidiaries or affiliates, the Participant shall vest in all shares of Deferred Stock.
(c) If a Participant becomes "Disabled" prior to the Maturity Date while an active employee of the Company or any of its parents, subsidiaries or affiliates, the Participant shall vest in all shares of Deferred Stock. For purposes of this Subparagraph 4(c), a Participant shall be considered "Disabled" if such Participant (i) is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve (12) months, or (ii) is, by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve (12) months, receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than three (3) months under an accident and health plan covering employees of the Participant's employer.

(e) If a Participant's employment with the Company or any of its parents, subsidiaries or affiliates terminates prior to the Maturity Date within two (2) years following a Change in Control as set forth in the Plan, either voluntarily for Good Reason or involuntarily (other than due to Cause), the Participant shall vest in all shares of Deferred Stock.
(f) If the Participant's employment with the Company or any of its parents, subsidiaries or affiliates is terminated prior to the Maturity Date and the Participant either receives benefits under a severance pay plan or program maintained by the Company or receives benefits under a separation agreement with the Company, the Participant shall vest in all  shares of Deferred Stock.
(g) If the Participant's employment with the Company or any of its parents, subsidiaries or affiliates is terminated prior to the Maturity Date due to a sale of a business or the outsourcing of any portion of a business, the Participant shall vest in all shares of Deferred Stock only if the Company or any of its parents, subsidiaries or affiliates failed to make an offer of comparable employment, as defined by the Company's Severance Pay Plan, to such Participant. For purposes of this Subparagraph 4(g), a Termination of Affiliation shall constitute a termination of employment.
5. .

(e) All shares of Deferred Stock which vest due to a Change in Control pursuant to Subparagraph 4(e), shall be paid immediately to such Participant.
(f) All shares of Deferred Stock which vest due to a termination of employment which meets the requirements of Subparagraph 4(f), shall be paid to such Participant immediately upon Participant's termination of employment unless the Participant was a key employee within the meaning of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) in which case payment shall be made six (6) months following the date of the Participant's termination of employment.
(g) All shares of Deferred Stock which vest due to the sale of a business or an outsourcing, pursuant to Subparagraph 4(g), shall be paid to such Participant immediately upon the earlier of such Participant's separation of service, within the meaning of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) or the Maturity Date unless the Participant was a key employee within the meaning of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) in which case payments due to Participant's separation from service shall be made six (6) months following the date of such separation from service.
(h) A Participant may make a one (1) time irrevocable election to extend the date for payment of the shares of Deferred Stock that would otherwise be paid on the date specified in Subparagraph 4(a). Any such election shall be in writing (or electronic form) and shall be filed with the Committee at least twelve (12) complete calendar months prior to the first day of that month which contains the Maturity Date. If a Participant files an election to extend the date of payment of Deferred Stock, payment shall be deferred for sixty (60) complete calendar months measured from the first of the month following that month which contains the Maturity Date unless the Participant dies prior to such date in which case payment shall be paid immediately to the beneficiary of such Participant under the Plan and, if no beneficiary has been designated, to the Participant's estate.
(i) Deferred Stock which is vested will be paid by the Company by the delivery to the Participant, or the Participant's beneficiary or legal representative, as soon as practicable, after the Participant is entitled to the payment of Deferred Stock, a certificate or certificates (or other indicia of ownership) of Williams Common Stock equal in number to the number of shares of Deferred Stock vested less the number of shares required to cover minimum statutory withholding requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by Code Section 409A and the guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service thereunder, if federal employment taxes become due upon the vesting of Deferred Stock, the number of shares of Deferred Stock necessary to cover minimum statutory withholding requirements (and federal income taxes thereon) will be used to satisfy such requirements upon such vesting.
6. . If, at anytime, a dividend is paid on the Common Stock of the Company in cash or otherwise, an equivalent amount per share will be paid to the Participant based on the number of shares of Deferred Stock then standing in the Participant's name on the books and records of the Company with respect to the Award made hereunder. Upon conversion of Deferred Stock into Common Stock hereunder, the right to payment of Dividend Equivalents under this provision will cease.
Payment of Dividend Equivalents
7. .
Other Provisions
(a) The Participant understands and agrees that payments under this Agreement shall not be used for, or in the determination of, any other payment or benefit under any continuing agreement, plan, policy, practice or arrangement providing for the making of any payment or the provision of any benefits to or for the Participant or the Participant's beneficiaries or representatives, including, without limitation, any employment agreement, any change of control severance protection plan or any employee benefit plan as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, including, but not limited to qualified and non-qualified retirement plans.
(b) The Participant agrees and understands that stock certificates (or other indicia of ownership) issued may be held as collateral for monies he/she owes to Company or any of its parents, affiliated or subsidiary companies or their vendor(s) contracted to provide business tools or services for use by Participant in his or her employment, including but not limited to personal loan(s), Company credit card debt, relocation repayment obligations or benefits from any plan that provides for pre-paid educational assistance.
(c) In the event that the Participant's employment with the Company or any of its parents, subsidiaries or affiliates terminates prior to the vesting of the Deferred Stock granted under this agreement, such Deferred Stock shall be forfeited (except as provided in Paragraph 4).

(e) Neither the Deferred Stock, nor the Participant's interest in the Deferred Stock, may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of or encumbered at any time prior to both the vesting and payment of such Deferred Stock under this Agreement.
(f) If the Participant at any time forfeits any or all of the Deferred Stock pursuant to this Agreement, the Participant agrees that all of the Participant's rights to and interest in the Deferred Stock shall terminate upon forfeiture without payment of consideration.
(g) The Committee shall make determination as to whether an event has occurred resulting in the forfeiture of the Deferred Stock, in accordance with this Agreement, and all determinations of the Committee shall be final and conclusive.
(h) With respect to the right to receive payment of the Deferred Stock under this Agreement, nothing contained herein shall give the Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company.
(i) The obligations of the Company under this Agreement are unfunded and unsecured. Each Participant shall have the status of a general creditor of the Company with respect to amounts due, if any, under this Agreement.
(j) The parties to this Agreement intend that this Agreement meet the requirements of Code Section 409A and recognize that it may be necessary to modify this Agreement and/or the Plan prior to December 31, 2005 to reflect guidance under Code Section 409A issued by the Internal Revenue Service.

Payment of Vested Deferred Stock
(a) Unless the Participant chooses to extend the date of payment, pursuant to Subparagraph 5(h), those shares of Deferred Stock which vest on the Maturity Date due to the fulfillment of both of the conditions set forth in Subparagraph 4(a), shall be paid immediately to such Participant. (b) Those shares of Deferred Stock which vest due to death, pursuant to Subparagraph 4(b), shall be paid immediately to the beneficiary of such Participant under the Plan and, if no beneficiary has been designated, to the Participant's estate.
(c) Those shares of Deferred Stock which vest due to "Disability," pursuant to Subparagraph 4(c), shall be paid immediately to such Participant.
(d) Those shares of Deferred Stock which vest due to "Retirement," pursuant to Subparagraph 4(d), shall be paid to such Participant immediately upon the Maturity Date unless the Participant was a key employee within the meaning of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) in which case payment shall be made no earlier than six (6) months following the date of "Retirement."
(e) Those shares of Deferred Stock which vest due to a Change in Control pursuant to Subparagraph 4(e), shall be paid immediately to such Participant.
(f) Those shares of Deferred Stock which vest due to a termination of employment which meets the requirements of Subparagraph 4(f), shall be paid to such Participant upon the Maturity Date unless the Participant was a key employee within the meaning of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) in which case payment shall be made no earlier than six (6) months following the date of the Participant's termination of employment.
(g) Those shares of Deferred Stock which vest due to the sale of a business or an outsourcing, pursuant to Subparagraph 4(g), shall be paid to such Participant immediately upon the earlier of such Participant's separation of service, within the meaning of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) or the Maturity Date unless the Participant was a key employee within the meaning of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) in which case payments due to Participant's separation from service shall be made no earlier than six (6) months following the date of such separation from service.
(h) A Participant may make a one (1) time irrevocable election to extend the date for payment of the shares of Deferred Stock that would otherwise be paid on the date specified in Subparagraph 4(a)(i). Any such election shall be in writing (or electronic form) and shall be filed with the Committee at least twelve (12) complete calendar months prior to the first day of that month which contains the Maturity Date. If a Participant files an election to extend the date of payment of Deferred Stock, payment shall be deferred for seventy-two (72) complete calendar months measured from the first of the month following that month which contains the Maturity Date unless the Participant dies prior to such date in which case payment shall be paid immediately to the beneficiary of such Participant under the Plan, and if no beneficiary has been designated, to the Participant's estate.
(i) Deferred Stock which is vested will be paid by the Company by the delivery to the Participant, or the Participant's beneficiary or legal representative, as soon as practicable, after the Participant is entitled to the payment of Deferred Stock, a certificate or certificates (or other indicia of ownership) of Williams Common Stock equal in number to the number of shares of Deferred Stock vested less the number of shares required to cover minimum statutory withholding requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by Code Section 409A and the guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service thereunder, if federal employment taxes become due upon the vesting of Deferred Stock, the number of shares of Deferred Stock necessary to cover minimum statutory withholding requirements (and federal income taxes thereon) will be used to satisfy such requirements upon such vesting.
6. . If, at anytime, a dividend is paid on the Common Stock of the Company in cash or otherwise, an equivalent amount per share will be paid to the Participant based on the number of shares of Deferred Stock then standing in the Participant's name on the books and records of the Company with respect to the Award made hereunder. Upon conversion of Deferred Stock into Common Stock hereunder, the right to payment of Dividend Equivalents under this provision will cease. In this regard, the number of shares of Deferred Stock then standing in the Participant's name shall be reduced when the performance measures for a performance year are not certified by the Committee pursuant to Subparagraph 4(a)(ii).
