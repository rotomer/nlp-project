Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
On May 13, 2005, The Williams Companies, Inc. ("Williams") determined that there was an inadvertent disclosure regarding the potential impact on Williams expectations regarding the segment profit for its Power segment for 2005 of any summer upside potential. Williams' expectations regarding summer upside potential of $25 million to $30 million have already been factored into its previously announced guidance for Power. This Form 8-K is being furnished solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD in light of the inadvertent disclosure. Williams does not intend to update these numbers or release similar information in the future. This Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. It should be read in conjunction with "Forward Looking Statements/Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement for Purposes of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995" in Willi ams Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, that discuss important factors that could cause Williams results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.
