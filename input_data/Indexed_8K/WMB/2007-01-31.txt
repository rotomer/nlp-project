To be timely, a Stockholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding Annual Meeting of Stockholders; , , that in the event that the Annual Meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the Stockholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the Annual Meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the Annual Meeting was made, whichever first occurs.
provided
however
To be in proper written form, a Stockholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth as to each matter such Stockholder proposes to bring before the Annual Meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the Annual Meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the Annual Meeting, (ii) the name and record address of such Stockholder, (iii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Company which are owned beneficially or of record by such Stockholder, (iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such Stockholder and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such business by such Stockholder and any material interest of such Stockholder in such business and (v) a representation that such Stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting to bring such business before the meeting.

Any Directors so elected, unless so reelected at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders or Special Meeting held in place thereof, next succeeding the time when the holders of any such Preferred Stock became entitled to elect Directors as above provided, shall not hold office beyond such Annual or Special Meeting. Any such provision for election of Directors by holders of the Preferred Stock shall apply notwithstanding the maximum number of Directors set forth in the provisions hereinabove.
Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as Directors of the Company, except as may be otherwise provided in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation with respect to the right of holders of preferred stock of the Company to nominate and elect a specified number of Directors in certain circumstances. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at any Annual Meeting of Stockholders, or at any Special Meeting of Stockholders called for the purpose of electing Directors, (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or (b) by any Stockholder of the Company (i) who is a Stockholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 9 and on the record date for the determination of Stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting and (ii) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 9.

Such notice must be accompanied by (i) a written consent of each proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a Director if elected, and (ii) a statement whether such person, if elected, intends to tender, promptly following such person's election or re-election, an irrevocable resignation effective upon such person's failure to receive the required vote for re-election at the next meeting at which such person would face re-election and upon acceptance of such resignation by the Board of Directors, in accordance with the Director Resignation Policy set forth in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines.
No person shall be eligible for election as a Director of the Company unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 9. If the Chairman of the meeting determines that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the Chairman shall declare to the meeting that the nomination was defective and such defective nomination shall be disregarded.
. Subject to the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of Directors may be filled by a majority of the Directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining Director, and the Directors so chosen shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the unexpired portion of the term of that directorship, and until their successors are duly elected and qualified, or until their earlier resignation or removal.

Signatures

When authorizing such issue of a new certificate, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such owner's legal representative, to advertise the same in such manner as the Board of Directors shall require and/or to give the Company a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Company and its transfer agents and registrars with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(b) In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in Section 1 of this Article VIII and except for the indemnitees covered under Section 2(a) above, any person entitled to indemnification in Section 1 may to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, be paid an advancement of expenses, , , that if the DGCL requires an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as an officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final adjudication that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 2(b) of this Article VIII or otherwise.

. . If a claim under Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII is not paid in full by the Company within 60 days after a written claim has been received by the Company, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be 20 days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Company in a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware to recover the unpaid amount of the claim.

In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Company to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article VIII or otherwise shall be on the Company.

Section 6
Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Company
. . The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this Article VIII shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer or employee and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article VIII that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.

Nature of Rights

Section 9
Subrogation
