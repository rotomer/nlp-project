Section 1.
. The Credit Agreement is hereby amended as follows:
Amendments to Credit Agreement
Section 1.1.
. Section 1.01 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by amending the definitions of "Rating Category" and "Termination Date" to read as follows:
Section 1.01
"" means, as to any Borrower, the relevant category (designated as a "Level" followed by a Roman numeral) applicable to such Borrower from time to time as set forth on Schedule IV, which is based on the ratings (or lack thereof) of such Borrower's senior unsecured long-term debt by S&P or Moody's. In the event there is a split between the ratings of any Borrower's senior unsecured long-term debt by S&P and Moody's, "Rating Category" shall be determined based on the lower rating of such Borrower's senior unsecured long-term debt by S&P or Moody's; that if such Borrower's rating is BB- or higher from S&P and Ba3 or higher from Moody's and there is a split between the two ratings, the pricing for such Borrower will be based on (i) if the split is one subgrade, the higher rating and (ii) if the split is more than one subgrade, the rating that is one subgrade below the higher rating. For example, if S&P rates the senior unsecured long-term debt of a Borrower BB+ and Moody's rates such debt B2, then Level VI on Schedule IV shall apply to such Borrower. For the avoidance of doubt (x) if there is a split between Level I and Level III, then Level I shall apply and (y) if the applicable Borrower's rating is BB- or higher from S&P and Ba3 or higher from Moody's and if there is a split between Level I and Level IV, V or VI, then Level III shall apply.
