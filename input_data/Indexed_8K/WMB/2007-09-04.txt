Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
In a investor presentation on September 5, 2007, The Williams Companies, Inc. ("Company" or "Williams") plans to include the following information about its previously announced stock repurchase program: The Company during August spent approximately $226 million to repurchase nearly 7.2 million of its common shares in open-market transactions. The average purchase price was $31.40. Williams board of directors in July authorized the Company to repurchase up to $1 billion of its common stock. The program, which has no expiration date, is designed to be funded with cash on hand and in a manner that ensures Williams maintains the financial strength necessary to pursue high-return investment opportunities.
