Jan. 14, 2008
Date:
TULSA, Okla.  Williams (NYSE:WMB) today announced that it has monetized a contractual right to a production payment on certain future international hydrocarbon production for approximately $148 million.
Of that amount, Williams has already received approximately $118 million in cash proceeds. Another $29 million has been placed into escrow, subject to certain post-closing conditions and adjustments. The company expects to report a significant non-recurring gain in the first quarter of 2008 as a result of this transaction.
The terminated contract was associated with Williams' prior international interests obtained from a merger with Barrett Resources Corporation in 2001.
Williams previously disposed of all of its ownership in the international development concession and retained only the contract for the production payment on future production.
With the termination of the contract, Williams has no further interests associated with the crude oil concession, which is located in Peru.
Williams, through its subsidiaries, finds, produces, gathers, processes and transports natural gas.  Williams' operations are concentrated in the Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountains, Gulf Coast, and Eastern Seaboard. More information is available at . Go to to join our e-mail list.
