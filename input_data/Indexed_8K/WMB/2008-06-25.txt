Exhibit 99.1
NYSE: WMB
          TULSA, Okla.  Williams (NYSE: WMB) announced today it has increased its consolidated segment profit and earnings per share guidance for 2008 and 2009.
          Williams has increased its 2008 consolidated recurring segment profit guidance to a range of $3.1 billion to $3.65 billion and earnings per share to a range of $2.30 to $2.80. The previous ranges were $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion and $1.70 to $2.10, respectively. For 2009, Williams has increased its consolidated segment profit guidance to a range of $2.9 billion to $3.8 billion and earnings per share to a range of $2.05 to $2.90. The previous ranges were $2.6 billion to $3.2 billion and $1.80 to $2.30, respectively.
          All consolidated segment profit and earnings per share ranges are presented on a recurring basis adjusted to remove the effect of mark-to-market accounting. A reconciliation of the company's income from continuing operations to recurring income from continuing operations and mark-to-market adjustments is available as an attachment to this news release. The latest previous guidance ranges were released on May 1, along with the company's first-quarter 2008 financial results.
          The increase in earnings guidance primarily reflects the company's more favorable outlook for commodity prices during 2008 and 2009. The more favorable prices are expected to benefit the company's exploration & production and midstream businesses. A chart attached to the end of this press release includes the guidance updates for the business segments and Williams in total.
          For 2008 the company now expects unhedged natural gas prices ranging from $9.00 to $10.50 per Mcfe (Henry Hub) and crude oil pricing in the range of $100 to $120 per barrel (West Texas Intermediate). Also for 2008, the company now expects average natural gas liquid (NGL) margins of 57 to 68 cents per barrel, up from previous guidance of 42 to 53 cents.
          For 2009, the company now expects unhedged natural gas prices ranging from $8.00 to $10.50 per Mcfe (Henry Hub) and crude oil pricing in the range of $80 to $120 per barrel (WTI). For 2009, the company now expects average NGL margins of 43 to 71 cents per barrel, up from previous guidance of 34 to 55 cents.
 
Growth Projects Drive Increase in Capital Expenditure Guidance
          Williams also is updating its capital expenditure guidance for 2008 and 2009. The new range for 2008 is $3.03 billion to $3.38 billion, up from the previous range of $2.6 billion to $2.95 billion. For 2009, the new range is $2.63 billion to $3.03 billion, compared with the previous range of $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion.
          Williams' recent acquisition of 24,000 net acres in the Piceance Basin and the associated increase in drilling activity are the primary drivers of the increase in capital expenditure guidance in 2008 and 2009. The recently announced planned expansion of the Echo Springs cryogenic processing plant is also driving the 2009 increase.
          A chart attached to the end of this press release includes the capital expenditure guidance updates for the business segments and Williams in total.
          While the company has previously stated it was investigating numerous investment opportunities not yet included its capital expenditure guidance, it will now provide capital expenditure expectations for these potential future projects. The inclusion of potential future project expectations is designed to provide investors with Williams' current views on total potential capital in the given year.
          For 2008, Williams has identified $100 million to $300 million in potential future projects, setting its total potential capital for the year at a range of $3.13 billion to $3.68 billion.
          For 2009, Williams has identified $400 million to $800 million in potential future projects, setting its total potential capital for the year at a range of $3.03 billion to $3.83 billion.
          The company is also reviewing additional investment opportunities it may pursue and add to total potential capital expenditures for 2008 and 2009.
Update on Share Repurchase Program
          In July 2007, Williams announced that its board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of the company's common stock. The stock-repurchase program has no expiration date.
          Through June 19, 2008, the company has purchased approximately 24.5 million shares for $840 million under the program at an average cost of $34.23 per share.
