("Williams") amends its Form 8-K filed June 25, 2008, in which it announced that it has increased its consolidated segment profit and earnings per share guidance for 2008 and 2009.

For 2009, the company now expects average NGL margins of 43 to 71 cents per gallon, up from previous guidance of 34 to 55 cents. On June 26, 2008, Williams issued a press release correcting the error. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Fo rm 8-K/A and is incorporated herein.
