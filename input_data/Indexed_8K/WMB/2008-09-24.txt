Such notice must be accompanied by (i) a written consent of each proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a Director if elected, and (ii) a statement whether such person, if elected, intends to tender, promptly following such person's election or re-election, an irrevocable resignation effective upon such person's failure to receive the required vote for re-election at the next meeting at which such person would face re-election and upon acceptance of such resignation by the Board of Directors, in accordance with the Director Resignation Policy set forth in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines.

If the Chairman of the Board determines that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the Chairman of the meeting shall declare to the meeting that the nomination was defective and such defective nomination shall be disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1, unless otherwise required by law, if the Stockholder does not provide the information required under clauses (b)(ii) and (c)(i)-(iii) of this Section 1 to the Company within five (5) business days following the record date for the meeting or if the Stockholder does not appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to present the nomination, such nomination shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Company. Nothing in this Section 1 shall be deemed to affect any rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation.
. Subject to the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of Directors may be filled by a majority of the Directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining Director, and the Directors so chosen shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the unexpired portion of the term of that directorship, and until their successors are duly elected and qualified, or until their earlier resignation or removal.

Each person (hereinafter referred to as an "indemnitee") who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute mechanism, inquiry, administrative or legislative hearing, investigation or any other actual, threatened or completed proceeding, including any and all appeals, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she (a) is or was an employee providing service to an employee benefit plan in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates participates or is a participating company or (b) is or was a director or an officer of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer (including elected or appointed positions that are equivalent to director or officer) of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director or officer (or equivalent) or in any other capacity while serving as a director or officer (or equivalent), shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"), as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 3 of this Article VIII with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Company shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or ratified by the Board of Directors of the Company.
Section 1. Right to Indemnification
. .
Section 2
Advancement of Expenses
(a) In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in Section 1 of this Article VIII, each director and each Section 16 officer, as determined by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company in accordance with Section 16a1-f of the Exchange Act (hereinafter referred to as a "Section 16 officer"), shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, also have the right to be paid by the Company the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); , , that, if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or any such officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Company of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 2(a) of this Article VIII or otherwise.
provided
however
(b) In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in Section 1 of this Article VIII and except for the Section 16 officers covered under Section 2(a) above, any other officer entitled to indemnification in Section 1 shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, also have the right to be paid by the Company an advancement of expenses, , , that (i) if the DGCL requires an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as an officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final adjudication that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 2(b) of this Article VIII or otherwise, and (ii) unless otherwise available pursuant to Section 4, the Company shall not advance or continue to advance expenses to any officer covered under this Section 2(b) of this Article VIII in any proceeding if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (x) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of directors who are not party to the proceeding with respect to which an advancement of expenses is sought, even though less than a quorum, (y) by a majority vote of a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, or (z) if there are no such directors or such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such officer acted in bad faith or in a manner that such officer did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. In no event shall any advance be made in instances where the Board of Directors, a committee or independent legal counsel reasonably determines that such officer deliberately breached such officer's duty to the Company or its stockholders.
provided
however
. . If a claim under Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII is not paid in full by the Company within 60 days after a written claim has been received by the Company, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be 20 days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Company in a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Company to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (a) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (b) in any suit brought by the Company to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Company shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Company (including its directors who are not parties to such proceeding, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such proceeding that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Company (including its directors who are not parties to such proceeding, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Company to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article VIII or otherwise shall be on the Company.
Section 3
Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit
. The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article VIII shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any law, agreement, vote of stockholders or directors, provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws or otherwise.
Section 4. Non-Exclusivity of Rights
. . The Company may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or another company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.
Section 5
Insurance
. . Except for those indemnitees entitled to indemnification under Section 1, the Company may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Company to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Company.
Section 6
Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Company
. . The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this Article VIII shall be contract rights. Such rights shall vest at the time an indemnitee becomes a director or officer of the Company and shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article VIII that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.
Section 7
Nature of Rights
. . The Company shall not be liable to indemnify any indemnitee under this Article VIII for any amounts paid in settlement of any action or claim effected without the Company's written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or for any judicial award if the Company was not given a reasonable and timely opportunity, at its expense, to participate in the defense of such action.
Section 8
Settlement of Claims
. . In the event of payment under this Article VIII, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Company effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.
Section 9
Subrogation
. The Board of Directors may establish reasonable procedures for the submission of claims for indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII, determination of the entitlement of any person thereto and review of any such determination. Such procedures shall be set forth in an appendix to these Bylaws and shall be deemed for all purposes to be a part hereof.
Section 10. Procedures for Submission of Claims
. These By-laws may be altered, amended, supplemented or repealed and new By-laws may be adopted by an affirmative vote of the holders of 75 percent of the voting power of all shares of outstanding stock of the Company entitled to vote at any duly constituted Annual or Special Meeting of Stockholders, and, except as otherwise expressly provided in a By-law made by the stockholders, by the Board of Directors at any duly constituted regular or special meeting thereof; provided that no amendment of these By-laws changing the place named therein for the annual election of Directors shall be made within sixty days next before the day on which any such election is to be held.
Section 1.
Amendments of By-laws
100514112_2.DOC

Exhibit 10.1
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors has determined that the inability to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers is detrimental to the best interests of the Company's stockholders and that the Company should act to assure such persons that there will be adequate certainty of protection through insurance and indemnification against risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the Company; and
WHEREAS, the Company has adopted provisions in its By-laws providing for indemnification of its officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the Company wishes to clarify and enhance the rights and obligations of the Company and Indemnitee with respect to indemnification; and
WHEREAS, in order to induce and encourage highly experienced and capable persons such as Indemnitee to serve and continue to serve as directors and officers of the Company and in any other capacity at the request of the Company, and to otherwise promote the desirable end that such persons will resist what they consider unjustified lawsuits and claims made against them in connection with the good faith performance of their duties to the Company, with the knowledge that certain costs, judgments, penalties, fines, liabilities and expenses incurred by them in their defense of such litigation are to be borne by the Company and they will receive the maximum protection against such risks and liabilities as may be afforded by law, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that the following Agreement is reasonable and prudent to promote and ensure the best interests of the Company and its stockholders; and
WHEREAS, the Company desires to have Indemnitee continue to serve as a director or officer of the Company and in such other capacities as the Company may request, as the case may be, free from undue concern for unpredictable, inappropriate or unreasonable legal risks and personal liabilities by reason of Indemnitee acting in good faith in the performance of Indemnitee's duties; and Indemnitee desires to continue so to serve, provided, and on the express condition, that he or she is furnished with the indemnity set forth hereinafter;
Now, therefore, in consideration of Indemnitee's continued service as a director or officer of the Company, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1. . Indemnitee will serve and/or continue to serve as a director or officer of the Company and, if applicable, as a director or officer (including elected or appointed positions that are equivalent to director or officer and for all purposes in this Agreement such positions shall be included within the terms "director" and "officer") of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (collectively, an "Other Enterprise") faithfully and to the best of Indemnitee's ability so long as Indemnitee is duly elected or appointed and until such time as Indemnitee is removed as permitted by law or tenders a resignation in writing.
Service by Indemnitee
2. . The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation law in effect on the date hereof or as such law may from time to time be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Company to provide prior to such amendment). Without diminishing the scope of the indemnification provided by this Section, the rights of indemnification of Indemnitee provided hereunder shall include but shall not be limited to those rights hereinafter set forth, except that no indemnification shall be paid to Indemnitee:
Indemnification
(a) to the extent expressly prohibited by Delaware law or the By-laws of the Company;
(b) for which payment is actually made to Indemnitee under a valid and collectible insurance policy or under a valid and enforceable indemnity clause, by-law or agreement of the Company or an Other Enterprise on whose board or as an officer Indemnitee serves at the request of the Company, except in respect of any indemnity exceeding the payment under such insurance, clause, by-law or agreement;
(c) in connection with an action, suit or proceeding, or part thereof (including claims and counterclaims) initiated by Indemnitee, except a judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 10 to enforce rights under this Agreement, unless the action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company or an Other Enterprise, as appropriate;
(d) with respect to any Proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Company against Indemnitee that is authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company or an Other Enterprise, as the case may be, except as provided in Sections 4, 5 and 6 below.
3. . Except as limited by Section 2 above, Indemnitee shall be entitled to the indemnification rights provided in this Section if Indemnitee is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding (other than an action by or in the name of the Company or an Other Enterprise) by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent or fiduciary of an Other Enterprise); or by reason of anything done or not done by Indemnitee in any such capacity. Pursuant to this Section, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all costs, judgments, penalties, fines, liabilities, amounts paid in settlement by or on behalf of Indemnitee, and Expenses (defined below) actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or such Other Enterprise, as the case may be, and with respect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.
Action or Proceedings Other than an Action by or in the Right of the Company or an Other Enterprise
4. . Except as limited by Section 2 above, Indemnitee shall be entitled to the indemnification rights provided in this Section if Indemnitee was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding brought by or in the name of the Company or an Other Enterprise to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee or agent or fiduciary of the Company or such Other Enterprise, or by reason of anything done or not done by Indemnitee in any such capacity. Pursuant to this Section, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all costs, judgments, penalties, fines, liabilities, amounts paid in settlement by or on behalf of Indemnitee, and Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or such Other Enterprise; provided, however, that no such indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which Delaware law expressly prohibits such indemnification by reason of any adjudication of liability of Indemnitee to the Company or such Other Enterprise, unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification for such costs, judgments, penalties, fines, liabilities and Expenses as such court shall deem proper.
Indemnity in Proceedings by or in the Name of the Company or an Other Enterprise
5. . Notwithstanding the limitations of Section 2(d), 3 and 4 above, to the extent that Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in whole or in part, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding (including an action, suit or proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Company or an Other Enterprise) or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, including, without limitation, the dismissal of any action without prejudice, or if it is ultimately determined by a final adjudication from which there is no further right to appeal that Indemnitee is otherwise entitled to be indemnified against Expenses, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection therewith.
Indemnification for Costs, Charges and Expenses of Successful Party
6. . If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of the costs, judgments, penalties, fines, liabilities or Expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any action, suit or proceeding (including an action, suit or proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Company or an Other Enterprise), but not, however, for all of the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion of such costs, judgments, penalties, fines, liabilities and Expenses actually and reasonably incurred to which Indemnitee is entitled.
Partial Indemnification
7. . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee's behalf if Indemnitee appears as a witness or otherwise incurs legal expenses as a result of or related to Indemnitee's service as a director or officer of the Company or an Other Enterprise, in any threatened, pending or completed legal, administrative, investigative or other proceeding or matter to which Indemnitee neither is, nor is threatened to be made, a party.
Indemnification for Expenses of a Witness
8. . Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to Sections 3, 4, 5,  6 or  7, the entitlement of Indemnitee to indemnification, to the extent not provided pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, shall be determined by the following person or persons who shall be empowered to make such determination: (a) the Board of Directors of the Company by a majority vote of Disinterested Directors (defined below), whether or not such majority constitutes a quorum; (b) a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, whether or not such majority constitutes a quorum; (c) if there are no Disinterested Directors, or if the Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel (defined below) in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee; (d) the stockholders of the Company; or (e) in the event that a Change in Control (defined below) has occurred, Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee. Such Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board of Directors and approved by Indemnitee, except as noted below. Upon failure of the Board so to select such Independent Counsel or upon failure of Indemnitee so to approve, such Independent Counsel shall be selected upon application to a court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change in Control has occurred, Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee and approved by the Company. A determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be made, and such indemnification shall be paid, not later than 60 calendar days after receipt by the Company of a written request for indemnification. Such request shall include documentation or information which is necessary for such determination and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee. Any Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with a request for indemnification or payment of Expenses hereunder, under any other agreement, any provision of the Company's By-laws or any directors' and officers' liability insurance, shall be borne by the Company. The Company hereby indemnifies Indemnitee for any such Expense and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom irrespective of the outcome of the determination of Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification. If the person making such determination shall determine that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification as to part (but not all) of the application for indemnification, such person shall reasonably prorate such partial indemnification among the claims, issues or matters at issue at the time of the determination.
Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification
9. . The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of Indemnitee's request for indemnification, advise in writing the Board of Directors or such other person or persons empowered to make the determination as provided in Section 8 that Indemnitee has made such request for indemnification. Upon making such request for indemnification, Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification hereunder and the Company shall have the burden of proof in making any determination contrary to such presumption. If the person or persons so empowered to make such determination shall have failed to make the requested determination with respect to indemnification within 60 calendar days after receipt by the Company of such request, a requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee shall be absolutely entitled to such indemnification, absent actual and material fraud in the request for indemnification. The termination of any Proceeding described in Sections 3 or 4 by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not, of itself: (a) create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or the Other Enterprise, as the case may be, or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful; or (b) otherwise adversely affect the rights of Indemnitee to indemnification except as may be provided herein.

In the event that a determination is made that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder or if payment has not been timely made following a determination of entitlement to indemnification pursuant to Sections 8 and 9, or if Expenses are not paid pursuant to Section 15, Indemnitee shall be entitled to final adjudication in a court of competent jurisdiction of entitlement to such indemnification or payment. Alternatively, Indemnitee at Indemnitee's option may seek an award in an arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association, such award to be made within 60 calendar days following the filing of the demand for arbitration. The Company shall not oppose Indemnitee's right to seek any such adjudication or award in arbitration or any other claim. The determination in any such judicial proceeding or arbitration shall be made and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of a determination (if so made) pursuant to Sections 8 or 9 that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification. If a determination is made or deemed to have been made pursuant to the terms of Section 8 or 9 that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination and is precluded from asserting that such determination has not been made or that the procedure by which such determination was made is not valid, binding and enforceable. The Company further agrees to stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement and is precluded from making any assertions to the contrary. If the court or arbitrator shall determine that Indemnitee is entitled to any indemnification or payment of Expenses hereunder, the Company shall pay all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such adjudication or award in arbitration (including, but not limited to, any appellate proceedings). In any suit brought by an Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to payment of Expenses hereunder, or brought by the Company to recover a payment of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to be paid such Expenses, shall be on the Company.
Remedies of Indemnitee in Cases of Determination not to Indemnify or to Pay Expenses
de novo
11. . Indemnification and payment of Expenses provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may now or in the future be entitled under any provision of the By-laws or other organizational documents of the Company, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors, provision of law, agreement or otherwise.
Other Rights to Indemnification
12. . In the event that Indemnitee is subject to or intervenes in any Proceeding in which the validity or enforceability of this Agreement is at issue or seeks an adjudication or award in arbitration to enforce Indemnitee's rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement, Indemnitee, if Indemnitee prevails in whole or in part in such action, shall be entitled to recover from the Company and shall be indemnified by the Company against any actual Expenses incurred by Indemnitee.
Expenses to Enforce Agreement
13. . All agreements and obligations of the Company contained herein shall continue during the period Indemnitee is a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or is serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent or fiduciary of an Other Enterprise and shall continue thereafter with respect to any possible claims based on the fact that Indemnitee held any such position. This Agreement shall be binding upon all successors and assigns of the Company (including any transferee of all or substantially all of its assets and any successor by merger or operation of law) and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, personal representatives and estate of Indemnitee.
Continuation of Indemnity
14. . Promptly after receipt by Indemnitee of notice of any Proceeding, Indemnitee will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Company under this Agreement, notify the Company in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the Company will not relieve it from any liability that it may have to Indemnitee. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, with respect to any such Proceeding of which Indemnitee notifies the Company:
Notification and Defense of Claim
(a) The Company shall be entitled to participate therein at its own expense; and
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 14(b), to the extent that it may wish, the Company, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to Indemnitee. After notice from the Company to Indemnitee of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the Company shall not be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement for any expenses of counsel subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof except as otherwise provided below. Indemnitee shall have the right to employ Indemnitee's own counsel in such Proceeding, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Company of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been authorized by the Company, (ii) Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Company and Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action or (iii) the Company shall not within 60 calendar days of receipt of notice from Indemnitee in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of the action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of Indemnitee's counsel shall be at the expense of the Company. The Company shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Company or as to which Indemnitee shall have made the conclusion provided for in (ii) above.
15. . All Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of any Proceeding shall be paid by the Company at the request of Indemnitee, each such payment to be made within 20 calendar days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements from Indemnitee requesting such payment or payments from time to time. Indemnitee's entitlement to such Expenses shall include those incurred in connection with any proceeding by Indemnitee seeking a judgment in court or an adjudication or award in arbitration pursuant to this Agreement (including the enforcement of this provision). Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the expenses and costs incurred by Indemnitee in connection therewith and shall include or be accompanied by an undertaking, in substantially the form attached as Exhibit 1, by or on behalf of Indemnitee to reimburse such amount if it is ultimately determined, by a final adjudication from which there is no further right to appeal, that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses by the Company as provided by this Agreement or otherwise. Indemnitee's undertaking to reimburse any such amounts is not required to be secured.
Payment of Expenses
16. . If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement (including without limitation, all portions of any paragraphs of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not by themselves invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, all portions of any paragraph of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent of the parties that the Company provide protection to Indemnitee to the fullest enforceable extent. This Agreement shall supersede and replace any prior indemnification agreements entered into by and between the Company and Indemnitee and any such prior agreements shall be terminated upon execution of this Agreement.
Separability; Prior Indemnification Agreements
17. . The Company shall not be liable to indemnify Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any Proceeding effected without the Company's written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or for any judicial award if the Company was not given a reasonable and timely opportunity, at its expense, to participate in the defense of such Proceeding in accordance with Section 14 above.
Consent to Settlement
18. . For purposes of this Agreement:
Definitions

(e) No supplement, modification or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by both parties hereto. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar) nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.
