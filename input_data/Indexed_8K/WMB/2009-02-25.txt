Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Annual Incentive Program 2008 Awards and 2009 Plan On February 23, 2009, the Compensation Committee of The Williams Companies, Inc. ("Williams") Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") determined that under Williams 2008 annual incentive program Williams exceeded the Economic Value Added ("EVA") incentive target established by the Compensation Committee in first quarter 2008 and approved awards for eligible employees for payment on March 13, 2009. EVA is a formula used to calculate the value created by a company's capital investments by measuring the Company's net after-tax operating profit reduced by a capital charge reflecting the cost of invested capital and after making adjustments designed to exclude the impact of extraordinary items. The 2008 annual incentive awards approved include $1,817,942 for Mr. Steven J. Malcolm, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; $735,000 for Mr. Donald R. Chappel, Sr. Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; $525,00 0 for Mr. Ralph A. Hill, Sr. Vice President  Exploration and Production; $525,000 for Mr. Alan S. Armstrong, Sr. Vice President  Midstream; and $525,000 for Mr. Phillip D. Wright, Sr. Vice President - Williams Gas Pipelines. The amount awarded to the other executive officers totaled $920,000. On February 23, 2009, the Compensation Committee approved the 2009 annual incentive program for the Companys named executive officers. Funding under the 2009 annual incentive program will be based on Williams 2009 EVA performance. Using market data for individuals in comparable positions and markets, the Compensation Committee established the EVA target incentive opportunity for each of our executive officers, expressed as a percentage of base salary. Each named executive officers target is 65%; except that the target for Mr. Donald R. Chappel, Sr. Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, is 75%, and the target for Mr. Steven J. Malcolm, Chairman, Presid ent and Chief Executive Officer, is 100%. Executive 2009 base salary and annual incentive targets have been frozen and remain unchanged from 2008 levels. The annual incentive program funds a bonus up to a maximum of 400 percent of target. Any amount above 200 percent of target is placed in a reserve. One-third of the total reserve balance is paid out in each subsequent year that threshold performance targets are met. Amounts remaining in the reserve are at risk based on future EVA performance. The Compensation Committee will review each executive officer's performance and contributions for the year, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer with respect to executives other than the Chief Executive Officer, and will adjust a named executive officer's incentive award based on the Compensation Committee's evaluation of individual performance. The Compensation Committee retains full discretion to determine whether a payout will be made under the program. 2009 Equity Awards On F ebruary 23, 2009, the Compensation Committee approved the 2009 equity award grants of stock options and performance-based restricted stock units for Mr. Steven J. Malcolm, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. The equity mix for the Chief Executive Officer will remain, as in the prior year, with 50% in stock options and 50% in performance-based restricted stock units. The Committee also approved grants of stock options, performance-based restricted stock units, as well as time-based restricted stock units for the other named executive officers. The Compensation Committee approved a change in the mix of equity compensation for named executive officers, other than the Chief Executive Officer. The change increased the percentage amount of stock options from 25% to 30%, increased the percentage amount of time-based restricted stock units from 25% to 35%, and decreased the percentage amount of performance-based restricted stock units from 50% to 35%. The terms of the stock options a nd time-based restricted stock units are materially consistent with the same type of awards granted in prior years. The terms of the performance-based restricted stock units provide recipients with the opportunity to earn between 0% and 200% of the units depending on the degree of achievement of both absolute and relative measurements of Total Shareholder Return at the end of a three-year period, provided that the recipient remains an active employee of the Company until February 23, 2012, and the Committee has certified that the Company has met these performance measures. This change to Total Shareholder Return is aligned with the Companys compensation philosophy and is intended to drive and motivate performance and align management with shareholders through this uncertain economic time. The absolute and relative Total Shareholder Return are weighted in a manner such that potential payout is based on the performance of both measures over the 3 year performance period. Relative Total Shar eholder Return is based on a predetermined list of comparator companies. Under certain circumstances, such as retirement, death, disability, or involuntary separation for service as a result of severance or sale of a business, these equity awards shall vest on a prorated basis with respect to that portion of the awards that are certified as having vested based on the achievement of the performance goals. If the recipient's employment is involuntarily terminated or voluntarily for good reason in connection with a change in control of the ownership of the Company, then these awards will vest as if the target performance measures were met. If the recipient is a "key employee" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, then pay out may be delayed to the extent necessary to avoid additional tax liabilities provided for under that section. The 2009 equity awards were granted subject to the terms of the grant agreements, the forms of which are filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1, Exhibi t 99.2, and Exhibit 99.3 and incorporated by reference herein. The details of the grants to the Company's named executive officers were separately reported on Forms 4 by these individuals on February 25, 2009.

Performance Measures; Number of Shares Payable to the Participant
(a) Performance measures established by the Committee shall be based on targeted levels of both absolute and relative Total Shareholder Return. The Committee establishes (i) "Threshold," "Target" and "Stretch" goals for Total Shareholder Return (both for absolute and relative Total Shareholder Return) during the Performance Period and (ii) the designated numbers of Shares that may be received by a Participant based upon the achievement of each such goal during the Performance Period, all as more fully described in Subparagraphs 4(b) through 4(c) below. The number of Shares that may be received by the Participant if the Target goal is reached is equal to the number of RSUs set forth in Paragraph 1 above.
(b) The RSUs awarded to Participant and subject to this Agreement as reflected in Paragraph 1 above represents Participant's opportunity to earn the right to payment of an equal number of Shares ("Target Number of Shares") upon (i) certification by the Committee that 100% of the Target goal for Total Shareholder Return for the Performance Period has been met and (ii) satisfaction of all the other conditions set forth in Paragraph 5 below.
(c) Subject to the Committee's discretion as set forth in Subparagraph 4(d) below and to satisfaction of all other conditions set forth in Paragraph 5 below, the actual number of Shares earned by and payable to Participant upon certification of Total Shareholder Return results and satisfaction of all other conditions set forth in Paragraph 5 below will be determined on a continuum ranging from 0% (at the Threshold goal) to 200% (at the Stretch goal) of the Target Number of Shares depending on the level of Total Shareholder Return certified by the Committee at the end of the Performance Period.
(d) Notwithstanding (i) any other provision of this Agreement or the Plan or (ii) certification by the Committee that targets for Total Shareholder Return above the Threshold goal have been achieved during the Performance Period, the Committee may in its sole and absolute discretion reduce, but not below zero (0), the number of Shares payable to the Participant based on such factors as it deems appropriate, including but not limited to the Company's performance. Accordingly, any reference in this Agreement to Shares that (i) become payable, (ii) may be received by a Participant or (iii) are earned by a Participant, and any similar reference, shall be understood to mean the number of Shares that are received, payable or earned after any such reduction is made.
5. .
Vesting; Legally Binding Rights
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, a Participant shall not be entitled to any payment of Shares under this Agreement unless and until such Participant obtains a legally binding right to such Shares and satisfies applicable vesting conditions for such payment.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in Subparagraphs 5(c)  5(g) below and subject to the provisions of Subparagraph 4(d) above, the Participant shall vest in Shares under this Agreement only if and at the time that both of the following conditions are fully satisfied:
(i) The Participant remains an active employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates on [February 25] of the third year following the year that contains the Effective Date (the "Maturity Date"); and
(ii) The Committee certifies that the Company has met Total Shareholder Return targets above the Threshold goal as defined by the Committee for the three-year performance period beginning January 1, 2009 (the "Performance Period"). Certification, if any, by the Committee for the Performance Period shall be made by the Maturity Date or as soon thereafter as is administratively practicable.
(c) If a Participant dies, becomes Disabled (as defined below) or qualifies for Retirement (as defined below) prior to the Maturity Date while an active employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates, at but not prior to the Maturity Date, and only to the extent and at the time that the Committee certifies that the performance measures for the Performance Period are satisfied under Subparagraph 5(b)(ii) above, upon such certification, the Participant shall vest in that number of Shares the Participant might otherwise have received for the Performance Period in accordance with Paragraph 4 above pro rated to reflect that portion of the Performance Period prior to such Participant's ceasing being an active employee of the Company and its Affiliates. The pro rata number of Shares in which the Participant may become vested in such case shall equal that number determined by multiplying (i) the number of Shares the Participant might otherwise have received for the Performance Period in accordance with Paragraph 4 above (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full and partial months in the period that begins the month following the month that contains the Effective Date and ends on (and includes) the date of the Participant ceases being an active employee of the Company and its Affiliates, and the denominator of which is the total number of full and partial months in the period that begins the month following the month that contains the Effective Date and ends on (and includes) the Maturity Date.
times
(d) As used in this Agreement, the terms "Disabled," "qualify for Retirement", "Separation from Service" and "Affiliate" shall have the following respective meanings:
(i) A Participant shall be considered Disabled if such Participant (A) is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve (12) months, or (B) is, by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve (12) months, receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than three (3) months under an accident and health plan covering employees of the Participant's employer. Notwithstanding the forgoing, all determinations of whether a Participant is Disabled shall be made in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and guidance thereunder.
(ii) A Participant "qualifies for Retirement" only if such Participant experiences a Separation from Service (as defined in (iii) below) after attaining age fifty-five (55) and completing at least three (3) years of service with the Company or any of its Affiliates.
(iii) "Separation from Service" means a Participant's termination or deemed termination from employment with the Company and its Affiliates (as defined in (iv) below). For purposes of determining whether a Separation from Service has occurred, the employment relationship is treated as continuing intact while the Participant is on military leave, sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence if the period of such leave does not exceed six (6) months, or if longer, so long as the Participant retains a right to reemployment with his or her employer under an applicable statute or by contract. For this purpose, a leave of absence constitutes a bona fide leave of absence only if there is a reasonable expectation that the Participant will return to perform services for his or her employer. If the period of leave exceeds six (6) months and the Participant does not retain a right to reemployment under an applicable statute or by contract, the employment relationship will be deemed to terminate on the first date immediately following such six (6) month period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a leave of absence is due to any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than six (6) months, and such impairment causes the Participant to be unable to perform the duties of the Participant's position of employment or any substantially similar position of employment, a twenty-nine (29) month period of absence shall be substituted for such six (6) month period. For purposes of this Agreement, a Separation from Service occurs at the date as of which the facts and circumstances indicate either that, after such date: (A) the Participant and the Company reasonably anticipate the Participant will perform no further services for the Company and its Affiliates (whether as an employee or an independent contractor or (B) that the level of bona fide services the Participant will perform for the Company and its Affiliates (whether as an employee or independent contractor) will permanently decrease to no more than twenty (20%) of the average level of bona fide services performed over the immediately preceding thirty-six (36) month period or, if the Participant has been providing services to the Company and its Affiliates for less than thirty-six (36) months, the full period over which the Participant has rendered services, whether as an employee or independent contractor. The determination of whether a Separation from Service has occurred shall be governed by the provisions of Treasury Regulation  1.409A-1, as amended, taking into account the objective facts and circumstances with respect to the level of bona fide services performed by the Participant after a certain date.
(iv) As used in this Agreement, "Affiliate" means all persons with whom the Company would be considered a single employer under Section 414(b) of the Code, and all persons with whom such person would be considered a single employer under Section 414(c) of the Code.
(e) If a Participant experiences a Separation from Service prior to the Maturity Date within two years following a Change in Controleither voluntarily for Good Reason or involuntarily (other than due to Cause), the Participant shall vest in that number Shares equal to the number of Shares that might otherwise be received by the Participant upon achievement of the Target goal.
,
(f) If the Participant experiences an involuntary Separation from Service prior to the Maturity Date and the Participant either receives benefits under a severance pay plan or program maintained by the Company or receives benefits under a separation agreement with the Company, at but not prior to the Maturity Date and only to the extent the Committee certifies that the performance measures for the Performance Period are satisfied under Subparagraph 5(b)(ii) above, the Participant shall, on the date of such certification, become vested in that number of Shares the Participant might otherwise have received for the Performance Period in accordance with Paragraph 4 above pro rated to reflect that portion of the Performance Period prior to the Participant's ceasing being an active employee of the Company and its Affiliates. The pro rata number of Shares which may be payable to Participant on but not prior to the Maturity Date in such case shall equal that number determined by multiplying (i) the number of Shares the Participant might otherwise have received for the Performance Period in accordance with Paragraph 4 above (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full and partial months in the period that begins the month following the month that includes the Effective Date and ends on (and includes) the date the Participant ceases being an active employee of the Company and its Affiliates, and the denominator of which is the number of full and partial months in the period that begins the month following the month that contains the Effective Date and ends on (and includes) the Maturity Date.
times
(g) If (i) the Participant experiences an involuntary Separation from Service prior to the Maturity Date due to a sale of a business or the outsourcing of any portion of a business, and (ii) the Company or any of its Affiliates fails to make an offer of comparable employment, as defined a severance plan or program maintained by the Company, to the Participant, then at the time and to the extent the Committee certifies that the performance measures for the Performance Period are satisfied under Subparagraph 5(b)(ii) above, upon such certification, the Participant shall become vested in that number of Shares the Participant might otherwise have received for the Performance Period in accordance with Paragraph 4 above pro rated to reflect that portion of the Performance Period prior to the Participant's ceasing being an active employee of the Company and its Affiliates. The pro rata number of Shares in which the Participant may become vested on, but not prior to, the Maturity Date in such case shall equal that number of Shares determined by multiplying (i) the number of Shares the Participant might otherwise have received for the Performance Period in accordance with Paragraph 4 above (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full and partial months in the period that begins the month following the month that contains the Effective Date and ends on (and includes) the date the Participant ceases being an active employee of the Company and its Affiliates, and the denominator of which is the total number of full and partial months in the period that begins the month following the month that contains the Effective Date and ends on (and includes) the Maturity Date.
times
For purposes of this Subparagraph 5(g), a Termination of Affiliation shall constitute an involuntary Separation from Service.
6. .
Payment of Shares
(ii) For purposes of this Subparagraph 6(a), "key employee" means an employee designated on an annual basis by the Company as of December 31 (the "Key Employee Designation Date") as an employee meeting the requirements of Section 416(i) of Code utilizing the definition of compensation under Treasury Regulation  1.415(c)-2(d)(2). A Participant designated as a "key employee" shall be a "key employee" for the entire twelve (12) month period beginning on April 1 following the Key Employee Designation Date.
(b) The payment date for all Shares in which the Participant becomes vested pursuant to Paragraph 5 above, other than Subparagraph 5(e) (as to which the payment date is determined in accordance with Subparagraph 6(a) above), shall be the calendar year containing the Maturity Date.
(c) Upon conversion of RSUs into Shares under this Agreement, such RSUs shall be cancelled. Shares that become payable under this Agreement will be paid by the Company by the delivery to the Participant, or the Participant's beneficiary or legal representative, one or more certificates (or other indicia of ownership) representing Shares of Williams Common Stock equal in number to the number of Shares otherwise payable under this Agreement less the number of Shares having a Fair Market Value, as of the date the withholding tax obligation arises, equal to the minimum statutory withholding requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code and the guidance thereunder, if federal employment taxes become due upon the Participant's becoming entitled to payment of Shares, the number of Shares necessary to cover minimum statutory withholding requirements may, in the Company's discretion, be used to satisfy such requirements upon such entitlement.
7. .
Other Provisions
(a) The Participant understands and agrees that payments under this Agreement shall not be used for, or in the determination of, any other payment or benefit under any continuing agreement, plan, policy, practice or arrangement providing for the making of any payment or the provision of any benefits to or for the Participant or the Participant's beneficiaries or representatives, including, without limitation, any employment agreement, any change of control severance protection plan or any employee benefit plan as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, including, but not limited to qualified and non-qualified retirement plans.
(b) The Participant agrees and understands that, subject to the limit expressed in clause (iii) of the following sentence, stock certificates (or other indicia of ownership) issued may be held as collateral for monies he/she owes to Company or any of its Affiliates, including but not limited to personal loan(s), Company credit card debt, relocation repayment obligations or benefits from any plan that provides for pre-paid educational assistance. In addition, the Company may accelerate the time or schedule of a payment of vested Shares, and/or deduct from any payment of Shares to the Participant under this Agreement, or to his or her beneficiaries in the case of the Participant's death, that number of Shares having a Fair Market Value at the date of such deduction to the amount of such debt as satisfaction of any such debt, that (i) such debt is incurred in the ordinary course of the employment relationship between the Company or any of its Affiliates and the Participant, (ii) the aggregate amount of any such debt-related collateral held or deduction made in any taxable year of the Company with respect to the Participant does not exceed $5,000, and (iii) the deduction of Shares is made at the same time and in the same amount as the debt otherwise would have been due and collected from the Participant.
provided
(c) Except as provided in Subparagraphs 5(c) through 5(g) above, in the event that the Participant's employment with the Company or any of its Affiliates terminates prior to the Maturity Date, RSUs subject to this Agreement and any right to Shares issuable hereunder shall be forfeited.
(d) The Participant acknowledges that this Award and similar awards are made on a selective basis and are, therefore, to be kept confidential.
(e) RSUs, Shares, and Participant's interest in RSUs and Shares, may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of or encumbered at any time prior to both (i) the Participant's becoming vested in Shares and (ii) payment of Shares under this Agreement.
(f) If the Participant at any time forfeits any or all of the RSUs pursuant to this Agreement, the Participant agrees that all of the Participant's rights to and interest in such RSUs and in Shares issuable thereunder shall terminate upon forfeiture without payment of consideration.
(g) The Committee shall determine whether an event has occurred resulting in the forfeiture of the RSUs and any Shares issuable thereunder in accordance with this Agreement, and all determinations of the Committee shall be final and conclusive.
(h) With respect to the right to receive payment of Shares under this Agreement, nothing contained herein shall give the Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company.
(i) The obligations of the Company under this Agreement are unfunded and unsecured. Each Participant shall have the status of a general creditor of the Company with respect to amounts due, if any, under this Agreement.
(j) The parties to this Agreement intend that this Agreement meet the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and recognize that it may be necessary to modify this Agreement and/or the Plan to reflect guidance under Section 409A of the Code issued by the Internal Revenue Service. Participant agrees that the Committee shall have sole discretion in determining (i) whether any such modification is desirable or appropriate and (ii) the terms of any such modification.
(k) The Participant shall become a party to this Agreement by accepting the Award either electronically or in writing in accordance with procedures of the Committee, its delegates or agents.
(l) Nothing in this Agreement or the Plan shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate the Participant's employment or service at any time, nor confer upon the Participant the right to continue in the employ of the Company and/or Affiliate.

(e) If the Participant qualifies for Retirement (as defined in (i) below) with the Company or any of its Affiliates prior to the Maturity Date due to such Retirement, at the time of such Participant's ceasing being an active employee the Participant shall vest in a pro rata number of the Shares as determined in accordance with this Subparagraph 4(e). The pro rata number referred to above shall be determined by multiplying the number of Shares subject to the Award by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full and partial months in the period that begins the month following the month that contains the Effective Date and ends on (and includes) the date of the Participant's ceasing being an active employee of the Company and its Affiliates, and the denominator of which is the total number of full and partial months in the period that begins the month following the month that contains the Effective Date and ends on (and includes) the Maturity Date.
(i) For purposes of this Subparagraph 4(e), a Participant "qualifies for Retirement" only if such Participant experiences a Separation from Service (as defined in (ii) below) after attaining age fifty-five (55) and completing at least three (3) years of service with the Company or any of its Affiliates.
(ii) As used in this Agreement, "Separation from Service" means a Participant's termination or deemed termination from employment with the Company and its Affiliates. For purposes of determining whether a Separation from Service has occurred, the employment relationship is treated as continuing intact while the Participant is on military leave, sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence if the period of such leave does not exceed six (6) months, or if longer, so long as the Participant retains a right to reemployment with his or her employer under an applicable statute or by contract. For this purpose, a leave of absence constitutes a bona fide leave of absence only if there is a reasonable expectation that the Participant will return to perform services for his or her employer. If the period of leave exceeds six (6) months and the Participant does not retain a right to reemployment under an applicable statute or by contract, the employment relationship will be deemed to terminate on the first date immediately following such six (6) month period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a leave of absence is due to any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than six (6) months, and such impairment causes the Participant to be unable to perform the duties of the Participant's position of employment or any substantially similar position of employment, a twenty-nine (29) month period of absence shall be substituted for such six (6) month period. For purposes of this Agreement, a Separation from Service occurs at the date as of which the facts and circumstances indicate either that, after such date: (A) the Participant and the Company reasonably anticipate the Participant will perform no further services for the Company and its Affiliates (whether as an employee or an independent contractor or (B) that the level of bona fide services the Participant will perform for the Company and its Affiliates (whether as an employee or independent contractor) will permanently decrease to no more than twenty (20%) of the average level of bona fide services performed over the immediately preceding thirty-six (36) month period or, if the Participant has been providing services to the Company and its Affiliates for less than thirty-six (36) months, the full period over which the Participant has rendered services, whether as an employee or independent contractor. The determination of whether a Separation from Service has occurred shall be governed by the provisions of Treasury Regulation  1.409A-1, as amended, taking into account the objective facts and circumstances with respect to the level of bona fide services performed by the Participant after a certain date.
(iii) As used in this Agreement, "Affiliate" means all persons with whom the Company would be considered a single employer under Section 414(b) of the Code, and all persons with whom such person would be considered a single employer under Section 414(c) of the Code.
(f) If the Participant experiences a Separation from Service prior to the Maturity Date within two years following a Change in Controleither voluntarily for Good Reason or involuntarily (other than due to Cause), the Participant shall vest in all of the Shares upon such Separation from Service.
,
(g) If the Participant experiences an involuntary Separation from Service prior to the Maturity Date and the Participant either receives benefits under a severance pay plan or program maintained by the Company or receives benefits under a separation agreement with the Company, the Participant shall vest in all Shares upon such Separation from Service.
(h) If the Participant experiences an involuntary Separation from Service prior to the Maturity Date due to a sale of a business or the outsourcing of any portion of a business, the Participant shall vest in all Shares upon such Separation from Service, but only if the Company or any of its Affiliates failed to make an offer of comparable employment, as defined by a severance pay plan or program maintained by the Company, to the Participant. For purposes of this Subparagraph 4(h), a Termination of Affiliation shall constitute an involuntary Separation from Service.

For purposes of this Subparagraph 5(d), "key employee" means an employee designated on an annual basis by the Company as of December 31 (the "Key Employee Designation Date") as an employee meeting the requirements of Section 416(i) of Code utilizing the definition of compensation under Treasury Regulation  1.415(c)-2(d)(2). A Participant designated as a "key employee" shall be a "key employee" for the entire twelve (12) month period beginning on April 1 following the Key Employee Designation Date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code and the guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service thereunder, if federal employment taxes become due upon the Participant's becoming entitled to payment of Shares, the number of Shares necessary to cover minimum statutory withholding requirements may, in the discretion of the Company, be used to satisfy such requirements upon such entitlement.
6. .

(b) The Participant agrees and understands that, subject to the limit expressed in clause (iii) of the following sentence, upon payment of Shares under this Agreement, stock certificates (or other indicia of ownership) issued may be held as collateral for monies he/she owes to Company or any of its Affiliates, including but not limited to personal loan(s), Company credit card debt, relocation repayment obligations or benefits from any plan that provides for pre-paid educational assistance. In addition, the Company may accelerate the time or schedule of a payment of vested Shares, and/or deduct from any payment of Shares to the Participant under this Agreement, or to his or her beneficiaries in the case of the Participant's death, that number of Shares having a Fair Market Value at the date of such deduction to the amount of such debt as satisfaction of any such debt, that (i) such debt is incurred in the ordinary course of the employment relationship between the Company or any of its Affiliates and the Participant, (ii) the aggregate amount of any such debt-related collateral held or deduction made in any taxable year of the Company with respect to the Participant does not exceed $5,000, and (iii) the deduction of Shares is made at the same time and in the same amount as the debt otherwise would have been due and collected from the Participant.
