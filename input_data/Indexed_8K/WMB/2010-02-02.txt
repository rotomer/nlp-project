Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     In connection with The Williams Companies, Inc.'s ("Williams") previously announced tender offer (the "Offer") to purchase up to $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Williams' outstanding debt securities (the "Notes") and consent solicitations to amend certain provisions of the indentures pursuant to which the Notes were issued, on February 1, 2010, Williams and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee under the indentures, executed an Eleventh Supplemental Indenture, a First Supplemental Indenture and a Fifth Supplemental Indenture (collectively, the "Supplemental Indentures") setting forth amendments to the applicable indentures governing the Notes. These amendments (i) clarify the inapplicability of the covenants limiting Williams' ability to merge or transfer its assets contained therein to the asset contribution transaction with Williams Partners L.P. that was announced on January 19, 2010 and (ii) align the lien covenant in one of such indentures with Williams' other indentures. The amendments set forth in the Supplemental Indentures will not become operative with respect to the Notes under an indenture unless and until Williams accepts for purchase such Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) and certain other conditions relating to consummation of the Offer are satisfied. Copies of the Supplemental Indentures are attached as Exhibits 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
     On February 2, 2010, Williams announced the early tender results for the Offer. The amount tendered represents the requisite number of consents required to approve the proposed amendments to such indentures and, as a result, Williams and the trustee under the indentures executed the Supplemental Indentures as described above in Item 1.01. The withdrawal deadline has passed, and holders that have tendered Notes may no longer withdraw such Notes or revoke their related consents. The tender offer and consent solicitations are scheduled to expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on February 16, 2010.
     The press release announcing the early tender results is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
     This report is neither an offer to purchase, nor a solicitation of an offer to sell, any securities. Williams is making the offer only by, and pursuant to, the terms and conditions of the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement dated January 19, 2010 and the related Letter of Transmittal and Consent Form.

Exhibit 99.1
Feb. 2, 2010
Date:
     TULSA, Okla.  Williams (NYSE: WMB) announced today the early tender results of its previously announced cash tender offer and consent solicitations.
     As of the previously announced early tender deadline of 5 p.m., New York City time, on Feb. 1, 2010, approximately $4.74 billion aggregate principal amount of notes subject to the tender offer and consent solicitations had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn.
     The holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of notes under each indenture have approved the proposed amendments to the indentures pursuant to which the notes were issued. As a result, Williams has received the requisite consents to enter into supplemental indentures to amend the indentures governing the notes, and Williams and the trustee under the indentures have executed such supplemental indentures.
     The amendments set forth in the supplemental indentures will not become operative with respect to the notes under an indenture unless and until Williams accepts for purchase such notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) and certain other conditions relating to consummation of the tender offer and consent solicitations are satisfied.
     The aggregate principal amount tendered with respect to each series of such notes is set out in the table below:
 
 
     The previously announced withdrawal deadline of 5 p.m., New York City time, on Feb. 1, 2010, has passed, and holders that have tendered notes in the tender offer may no longer withdraw such notes or revoke their related consents. Holders that have already tendered notes in the tender offer and consent solicitations are eligible to receive the Total Consideration for each series of notes in the table above.
     The amount of each series of notes that is purchased in the tender offer will be determined in accordance with the Acceptance Priority Level noted in the table above. Williams will purchase any and all of the validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) notes listed above as Acceptance Priority Level 1. Williams will purchase validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) notes listed above as Acceptance Priority Level 2 subject to a cap equal to the $3 billion tender cap minus the aggregate principal amount of Acceptance Priority Level 1 notes accepted for purchase. In the event the tender offer is oversubscribed, Acceptance Priority Level 2 notes will be accepted on a pro rata basis.
     Holders that validly tender their notes after the early tender deadline but at or prior to the previously announced expiration time of 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Feb. 16, 2010, will be eligible to receive only the previously announced Tender Offer Consideration, which is equal to the Total Consideration on each series of notes minus an Early Tender Premium of $30 per $1,000 principal amount of notes.
     The complete terms and conditions of the tender offer and consent solicitations are set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated Jan. 19, 2010, and the related Letter of Transmittal and Consent Form that were sent to holders of notes. All capitalized terms used but not defined in this press release shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Offer to Purchase. Holders are urged to read the Offer to Purchase and the Letter of Transmittal and Consent Form carefully.
     Williams is making this tender offer and consent solicitations as part of the strategic restructuring the company jointly announced with Williams Partners L.P. (NYSE: WPZ) on Jan. 19. Consummation of the tender offer and consent solicitations is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including closing of the asset contribution transaction with Williams Partners and successful consummation of the Williams Partners private bond offering, establishment of its credit facility and executing the appropriate Supplemental Indentures. Please see the Jan. 19 news release for detailed information about the restructuring.
     The Dealer Managers and Solicitation Agents for the tender offer and consent solicitations are Barclays Capital Inc. and Citi. Global Bondholder Services Corporation is acting as the Information Agent and the Depositary for the tender offer and the consent solicitations.
     This press release is neither an offer to purchase, nor a solicitation of an offer to sell, any securities. Williams is making the offer only by, and pursuant to, the terms and conditions of the Offer to Purchase and the Letter of Transmittal and Consent Form. Copies of these documents may be obtained from the Information Agent, Global Bondholder Services Corporation, which can be reached at (212) 430-3774 or toll-free at (866) 736-2200.
