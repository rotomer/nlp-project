Entry into New Credit Facility Agreements
The Williams Companies, Inc.
          On June 3, 2011, The Williams Companies, Inc. ("WMB"), as borrower, entered into a new $900 million five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the "WMB Credit Facility Agreement"), together with the lenders named therein, and Citibank N.A. ("Citi"), as administrative agent. Under the terms of the WMB Credit Facility Agreement, WMB may request an increase in the commitments of up to an additional $250 million by commitments from either new lenders or increased commitments from existing lenders. The WMB Credit Facility Agreement may be used for working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.
          The WMB Credit Facility Agreement replaces an existing WMB credit agreement, dated as of May 1, 2006, by and among , WMB, the lenders from time to time parties thereto, and Citi, as administrative agent (as amended, modified, or otherwise supplemented from time to time, the "Existing WMB Credit Agreement").
          Interest on borrowings under the WMB Credit Facility Agreement is payable at rates per annum equal to, at the option of WMB: (1) a fluctuating base rate equal to Citi's adjusted base rate plus the applicable margin, or (2) a periodic fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus the applicable margin. The adjusted base rate will be the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.5 percent, (ii) Citi's publicly announced base rate, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.0 percent. WMB is required to pay a commitment fee based on the unused portion of the commitments under the WMB Credit Facility Agreement. The applicable margin and the commitment fee are determined by reference to a pricing schedule based on WMB's senior unsecured debt ratings.
          Under the WMB Credit Facility Agreement, if WMB, in any fiscal quarter, makes one or more acquisitions for a total aggregate purchase price that exceeds or equals $50 million, WMB is required to maintain a ratio of debt to EBITDA of no greater than 5.00 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter in which the acquisition occurs and the two fiscal quarters following thereafter. In any other case, WMB is required to maintain a ratio of debt to EBITDA of no greater than 4.50 to 1.00. Each of the above ratios will be tested beginning June 30, 2011 at the end of each fiscal quarter, and the debt to EBITDA ratio will be measured on a rolling four-quarter basis.
          The WMB Credit Facility Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and affirmative, negative and financial covenants which were made only for the purposes of the WMB Credit Facility Agreement and as of the specific date (or dates) set forth therein, and may be subject to certain limitations as agreed upon by the contracting parties. The covenants limit, among other things, the ability of WMB's subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, WMB and its material subsidiaries from granting certain liens supporting indebtedness, and WMB's ability to merge or consolidate with any person or sell all or substantially all of its assets to any person, enter into certain affiliate transactions, make certain distributions during the continuation of an event of default and allow material change in the nature of its business. In addition, the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the WMB Credit Facility Agreement may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries of the WMB Credit Facility Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants contained therein, or any descriptions thereof, as characterizations of the actual state of facts or conditions of WMB.
          The WMB Credit Facility Agreement includes customary events of default, including events of default relating to non-payment of principal, interest or fees, inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect when made or when deemed made, violation of covenants, cross payment-defaults, cross acceleration, bankruptcy and insolvency events, certain unsatisfied judgments and a change of control. If an event of default with respect to WMB occurs under the WMB Credit Facility Agreement, the lenders will be able to terminate the commitments and accelerate the maturity of the loans of WMB under the WMB Credit Facility Agreement and exercise other rights and remedies.
          The foregoing description of the WMB Credit Facility Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the WMB Credit Facility Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference. The WMB Credit Facility Agreement is filed as an exhibit to this Current Report on form 8-K to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about WMB or the other parties to the agreement or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.

     (d) Each Lender Party acknowledges that Communications delivered hereunder and under the other Loan Documents may contain Restricting Information and that such Communications are available to all Lender Parties generally.
