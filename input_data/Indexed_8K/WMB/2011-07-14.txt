On July 14, 2011, The Williams Companies, Inc. (the "Company") announced that it has made a revised proposal to the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of Southern Union Company ("Southern Union") to acquire all of Southern Union's outstanding common stock for $44.00 per share in cash.
Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference is the press release issued by the Company regarding the revised acquisition proposal.
Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated herein by reference is the form of Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among the Company, Williams Merger Subsidiary, Inc. and Southern Union, delivered to Southern Union in connection with the revised acquisition proposal.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
July 14, 2011
DATE:
 
 
 
TULSA, Okla.  Williams (NYSE: WMB) announced today that it submitted an enhanced proposal to acquire Southern Union Company (NYSE: SUG) for $44.00 per share in cash, for a total enterprise value of $9.4 billion. Williams conveyed the all-cash, premium proposal via a letter to the Special Committee of Southern Union's Board of Directors.
Williams' enhanced proposal represents a premium of 10% over the nominal purchase price in Southern Union's recently revised agreement with Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. (NYSE: ETE) ("Energy Transfer"), announced on July 5, 2011. The Williams proposal also represents a premium of 56% over Southern Union's closing share price of $28.26 on June 15, 2011, the last trading day prior to the initial Energy Transfer announcement.
"Based on the due diligence we have completed to date, we have revised our forecasts and synergy estimates and are pleased to deliver Southern Union an enhanced proposal to acquire the company for $44.00 per share in cash," said Alan Armstrong, Williams' President and Chief Executive Officer. "We are more convinced than ever of the strategic and financial benefits of Williams' acquisition of Southern Union. Our proposal offers more than just premium value and full liquidity to the Southern Union shareholders; it is designed to result very quickly in a
merger agreement and provide certainty around financing and regulatory approvals. Williams is offering Southern Union a clear, direct path to the highest value for its shareholders.
"Based on the terms of our premium-value, all-cash proposal, we are confident that Southern Union's Board of Directors will determine its superiority to the Energy Transfer agreement," Armstrong said. "We look forward to working with Southern Union's Board and management team to quickly finalize a definitive agreement.
"For Williams, this is a compelling transaction that would be immediately accretive to cash flows and dividends as well as enhance long-term growth opportunities," Armstrong added. "Our revised, superior proposal would allow us to further build upon our presence in premier markets while maintaining our financial flexibility and commitment to investment-grade ratings and supporting our high dividend strategy."
The Williams proposal is not subject to any financing conditions. Williams is prepared to deliver bank financing commitments to finance the all-cash purchase price concurrent with signing the merger agreement.
Williams has also strengthened its commitment to gaining regulatory approval and will close the transaction on a timeline consistent with the proposed Energy Transfer transaction. Williams is committed to take all necessary actions to obtain federal anti-trust clearance and will otherwise provide the same degree of regulatory certainty as the proposed Energy Transfer transaction.
The text of the letter Williams delivered today to the Special Committee of the Southern Union Board of Directors follows:
July 14, 2011
The Special Committee of the Board of Directors of Southern Union
cc: Mr. George Lindemann, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
cc: Mr. Eric Herschmann, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer
cc: Ms. Monica Gaudiosi, Senior Vice President and General Counsel
Williams is pleased to submit an enhanced proposal to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Southern Union (the "Company") at a purchase price of $44.00 per share, payable in cash, which represents a total enterprise value of approximately $9.4 billion.
We are confident that both you and your shareholders will find our enhanced proposal to be superior to the Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. (NYSE: ETE) ("Energy Transfer") transaction.
 
 
 
 
We have attached the merger agreement and are simultaneously providing the Special Committee's advisors financing commitment papers that we are prepared to execute once you have terminated your agreement with Energy Transfer. Williams' proposed merger agreement is substantially similar to the revised merger agreement between the Company and Energy Transfer with revisions to reflect our all cash purchase price.
Williams is prepared to move quickly to consummate this transaction, which we believe is in the best interests of both companies' shareholders. To that end, we believe that we can finalize terms of a potential transaction with Southern Union by Tuesday July 19 based upon the following schedule:
 
 
For many reasons, adhering to the schedule is crucial to our proposal. We are confident that this schedule provides a certain route to deliver superior value to your shareholders. The similarity of our proposed merger agreement to the Energy Transfer agreement should enable the Special Committee to make a prompt finding that our offer is superior and much of the due diligence and preparatory work required to execute a merger agreement is behind us.
We are more convinced than ever of the strategic benefits of this transaction. It is clearly in the best interests of our respective shareholders. We look forward to putting our two great companies together.
Very truly yours,
/s/ Alan Armstrong

President and Chief Executive Officer of Williams
As previously announced, Williams is proceeding with its plan to separate its exploration and production business in a two-step process. The initial public offering of WPX Energy is on track for the third quarter of 2011, with the subsequent tax-free spinoff to Williams shareholders expected to be completed no later than the first quarter of 2012. This process is designed to create two, independent, pure-play companies that are better positioned for growth and appeal to distinct groups of investors. The company noted that the proposal to acquire Southern Union has no impact on the timing of the separation transaction.
Barclays Capital and Citi are serving as financial advisors to Williams and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP are serving as its legal advisors.
