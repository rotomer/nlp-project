Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
TULSA, Okla.  Williams (NYSE: WMB) today affirmed its strong interest in acquiring Southern Union Company (NYSE: SUG) for $44.00 per share in cash. Williams conveyed its proposal via a letter to the Special Committee of Southern Union's Board of Directors.
Williams' all-cash proposal represents value certainty of $44.00 per share to Southern Union shareholders. The Williams proposal represents a premium of 4% over the implied value of the agreement with Energy Transfer
Equity, L.P. (NYSE: ETE) of $42.32 based on the closing price of Energy Transfer units on Tuesday, August 16, 2011, assuming Southern Union shareholders elect the maximum cash percentage under that agreement. Williams' proposal also represents a material premium to the implied value of the Energy Transfer deal based on any recent average trading price of Energy Transfer units, including one-week, one-month, three-month, six-month and one-year averages.
"Forty-four dollars a share, cash, for every shareholder is a superior offer for Southern Union's shareholders," said Alan Armstrong, president and chief executive officer. "Southern Union's current agreement with Energy Transfer includes illiquid partnership units whose value will be exposed to equity markets in the months until closing and beyond.
"Williams' due diligence is complete, we have reviewed Southern Union's recent 10-Q and we have evaluated the market conditions and environment. We are ready and excited to move forward quickly to sign a definitive merger agreement and combine Southern Union with Williams," he said.
"Southern Union is an excellent strategic fit with Williams. We are confident that Williams' acquisition of Southern Union will immediately increase our cash flows, support our commitment to high-dividend payouts and drive long-term growth. It also allows us to maintain our financial flexibility and commitment to investment-grade credit," Armstrong said.
The Williams proposal is not subject to any financing conditions. Williams has delivered bank financing commitments to finance the all-cash purchase price to be signed concurrent with signing the merger agreement.
Williams remains committed to take all necessary actions to obtain federal antitrust clearance and will provide the same degree of regulatory certainty as contained in the second amended Energy Transfer agreement.
The text of the letter Williams delivered today to the Special Committee of the Southern Union Board of Directors follows:
August 16, 2011
The Special Committee of the Board of Directors of Southern Union
Williams is today affirming its strong interest in acquiring 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Southern Union at a purchase price of $44.00 per share, payable in cash.
We are confident that both you and Southern Union shareholders will conclude that our $44.00- per-share, all-cash proposal is superior to your proposed transaction with Energy Transfer.
 
 
The recent equity market volatility further highlights the benefits to the Southern Union shareholders of our all-cash proposal. As you know, Energy Transfer shares last week traded as low as $33.21, implying a transaction value for Southern Union of $39.83. We expect that your shareholders will greatly appreciate the certainty provided by our offer, which represents a material premium to the implied value of the Energy Transfer deal based on any recent average trading price of Energy Transfer units, including one-week, one-month, three-month, six-month and one-year averages.
We have attached a proposed merger agreement that is substantially similar to the revised merger agreement with Energy Transfer with revisions to reflect our all cash purchase price. We are prepared to immediately execute the merger agreement, subject to our receipt and review of the disclosure schedules. We are simultaneously providing the Special Committee's advisers a copy of our bank financing commitment papers and disclosure schedules to the merger agreement.
Williams is a disciplined buyer; the clarity and fairness of the process leading up to signing a definitive merger agreement and combining our companies is paramount. We must be assured that the Special Committee, with the assistance of its independent advisers, assumes responsibility for negotiating the terms of all agreements with potential acquirers. As well, the Special Committee must ensure that Southern Union discloses all arrangements or amendments to arrangements in place between Southern Union and Energy Transfer or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors. We also would
expect assurance that the Special Committee would prohibit all such arrangements in the future. The draft merger agreement attached to this letter contains provisions to this effect.
We are confident that you will act quickly to deliver superior value to Southern Union shareholders.
Very truly yours,
/s/ Alan Armstrong
