("Williams Partners") that he will take an indefinite leave of absence for medical reasons from his role as Senior Vice President  Gas Pipelines. Mr. Barnards responsibilities will be temporarily performed by Frank J. Ferazzi until January 1, 2013 when the senior management structure reorganization announced on July 30, 2012 takes effect. Mr. Ferazzi, 55, has acted as the Vice President and General Manager of Williams Gas Pipeline - East since July 2010. He has served as a Vice President of Williams gas pipeline business since 1995. Since joining Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC, now a subsidiary of Williams and William Partners, in 1981, Mr. Ferazzi has held various management positions in rates and regulatory, customer service, business development and operations.

His current term will conclude at the next annual meeting of the sole member of the General Partner, scheduled for August 31, 2012.
