The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Securities shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or pursuant to the indenture (the "Indenture") identified in such Pricing Agreement. 1. Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as their representative. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of the Underwriter to purchase the Securities. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall specify (a) in Schedule I thereto (i) the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities and (ii) the principal amount of Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter on the Time of Delivery (as defined herein) and (b) in Schedule II thereto (i) the title or titles of the Designated Securities, (ii) the aggregate principal amount or amounts of the Designated Securities, (iii) the initial public offering price of the Designated Securities, (iv) the purchase price or prices to the Underwriters of the Designated Securities, and, to the extent applicable, the selling concession or concessions and reallowance concession or concessions applicable to the Underwriters and dealers, as the case may be, (v) 1
specified funds, if any, for payment of the purchase price for the Designated Securities, (vi) the title of the Indenture under which the Designated Securities are being issued, (vii) the maturity or maturities of the Designated Securities, (viii) the interest rate or rates of the Designated Securities, (ix) the interest payment dates of the Designated Securities, (x) the record date or dates of the Designated Securities, (xi) the redemption provisions, if any, of the Designated Securities, (xii) the sinking fund provisions, if any, of the Designated Securities, (xiii) the Time of Delivery, (xiv) the closing location with respect to the closing of the sale of the Designated Securities pursuant to this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement, (xv) the name or names and address or addresses of the Representatives of the Underwriters and (xvii) such other terms, conditions or other provisions that supplement, amend or modify this Agreement or the Indenture with respect to the Designated Securities. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint. 2.

(ix) The issue and sale of the Designated Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Designated Securities, the Indenture, this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject, nor will such actions result in any violation of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or any statute or any order, rule or regulation known to such counsel of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties; (x) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Designated Securities or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or such Pricing Agreement or the Indenture, except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Designated Securities by the Underwriters; (xi) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and they have no reason to believe that any of such documents, when they became effective or were so filed, as the case may be, contained, in the case of a registration statement that became effective under the Act, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or, in the case of other documents that were filed under the Act or the Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading; and (xii) The Registration Statements and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities (other than 12
the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; they have no reason to believe that, as of their respective effective dates, the Registration Statements or any further amendment thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinions contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that, as of its date, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery other than the financial statements and related schedules therein as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading or that, as of the Time of Delivery, either the Registration Statements or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading; and they do not know of any amendment to the Registration Statements required to be filed or any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statements or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statements or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented that are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required; (xiii) The statements made in any tax consequences or tax considerations sections in the Prospectus, including in any supplement thereto, insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of matters of United States federal tax law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute accurate summaries of the matters described therein in all material respects; and (xiv) Each Registration Statement registering the offer and sale of the Designated Securities has become effective under the Act, and the Prospectus relating to the Designated Securities, including all amendments and supplements thereto, was filed within the prescribed time periods pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations under the Act and, to our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statements has been issued or proceeding for the purpose has been instituted or threatened by the Commission; Such counsel may rely, with respect to matters of New York law, on the written opinion of Fulbright & Jaworski LLP, provided that such opinion is in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives and a copy thereof shall be delivered to the Representatives at the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities. 13

(a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities for actions in respect thereof, arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statements, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities or included in the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statements, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities or included in the Registration Statement, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Securities expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Securities. (b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof, arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statements, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities or included in the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the Statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary 15
Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statements, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities or included in the Registration Statement, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 10(a) or 10(b) of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other shall reasonable costs of investigation. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 10 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 10(a) or 10(b) in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities for actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 10(c), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statement or omissions that resulted in such losses claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the 16
other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Finance Subsidiaries and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 10(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 10(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this Section 10(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such securities and are not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 10 shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 10 shall be in addition to any liability that the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director and officer of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 11. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities that it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the Purchase of such Designated Securities, the representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statements or the Prospectus as amended or may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statements or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statements or the Prospectus that in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term 17
"Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 11 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in Section 11(a), the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities or a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in Section 11(a), the aggregate principal amount or Designated Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, as referred to in Section 11(b), or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in Section 11(b) to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or underwriters then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 8 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 10 hereof but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 12. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Finance Subsidiaries and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company or the Finance Subsidiaries or any director or officer or controlling person of the Company or the Finance Subsidiaries, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. 13. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 11 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities covered by such pricing Agreement except as provided in Section 8 and Section 10 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making 18
preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Section 8 and Section 10 hereof. 14. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement. 15. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Company or any Finance Subsidiaries, shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission (which shall be effective upon confirmation by telephone) to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statements, Attention: Chief Executive Officer, with a copy to the General Counsel of the Company; and, if to the Underwriters, shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission (which shall be effective upon confirmation by telephone) to the address or addresses of the Representative or Representatives, as the case may be, as set forth in the Pricing Agreement, provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail telex or facsimile transmission (which shall be effective upon confirmation by telephone) to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representative or Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof. 16. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Section 10 and Section 11 hereof, the directors and officers of the Company and the Finance Subsidiaries and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase. 17. Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business. 18. THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH PRICING AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 19. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. 19

Payment of Additional Amounts; Redemption Upon a Tax Event. (a) Payment of Additional Amounts. The Company shall pay to the holder of this Note who is a United States Alien (as defined below) such additional amounts as may be necessary so that every net payment of principal of and interest on this Note to such holder, after deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed upon such holder by the United States of America or any taxing authority thereof or therein, will not be less than the amount provided in the Notes to be then due and
3 payable (such amounts, the "Additional Amounts"); provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to make any payment of Additional Amounts for or on account of: (i) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for (A) the existence of any present or former connection between such holder, or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary of, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, such holder, if such holder is an estate, trust, partnership or corporation, and the United States including, without limitation, such holder, or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, shareholder or possessor, being or having been a citizen or resident of the United States of America or treated as a resident thereof or being or having been engaged in trade or business or present in the United States of America, or (B) the presentation of this Note for payment on a date more than 30 days after the later of (x) the date on which such payment becomes due and payable and (y) the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for; (ii) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, excise, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge; (iii) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by reason of such holder's past or present status as a passive foreign investment company, a controlled foreign corporation, a personal holding company or foreign personal holding company with respect to the United States of America, or as a corporation which accumulates earnings to avoid United States federal income tax; (iv) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge which is payable otherwise than by withholding from payment of principal of or interest on this Note; (v) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment of principal of or interest on this Note if such payment can be made without withholding by any other paying agent; (vi) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge which would not have been imposed but for the failure to comply with certification, information, documentation or other reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connections with the United States of America of the holder or beneficial owner of this Note, if such compliance is required by statute or by regulation of the United States Treasury Department as a precondition to relief or exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge; (vii) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed on interest received by (A) a 10% shareholder (as defined in Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the regulations that may be promulgated thereunder) of the Company or (B) a controlled foreign corporation with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Code; or (viii) any combination of items (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) in this Section 4(a);
4 nor shall any Additional Amounts be paid to any holder who is a fiduciary partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of this Note to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, or a member of such partnership or a beneficial owner thereof would not have been entitled to the payment of such Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the holder.

Such Definitive Notes shall be registered in such name or names as the Depositary shall instruct the Trustee. 12. Registration, Transfer and Exchange. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Company shall provide for the registration of the Notes and the transfer and exchange of the Notes, whether in global or Definitive form.

All such payments made to or upon the order of such holder shall, to the extent of the amount or amounts paid, effectually satisfy and discharge liability for moneys payable on this Note.
