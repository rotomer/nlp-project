BENTONVILLE, Ark., May 13, 2003  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. reported record earnings and sales for the quarter ended April 30, 2003.

Earnings per share were $0.42 up from the $0.37 per share reported in the same prior year quarter. These results include the effect of adopting Emerging Issues Task Force Consensus No. 02-16 (EITF 02-16), on accounting for money received from suppliers, which reduced first-quarter 2004 earnings by approximately $101 million after tax ($0.02 per share).
 
On May 2, 2003, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell McLane Company, Inc. ("McLane"), a wholly owned subsidiary. The sales amounts disclosed above do not include McLane sales for the comparative periods. If McLane sales were included, the sales increase would be 9.1 percent for the quarter.

The Wal-Mart Stores division had another good performance, the SAM'S CLUBS showed significant improvement, and our best performance for the quarter came from our international division."
