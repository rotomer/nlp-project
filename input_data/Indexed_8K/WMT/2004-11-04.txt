BENTONVILLE, Ark., November 4, 2004 - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. reported net sales for the four-week period ending October 29, 2004, of $21.042 billion, an increase of 10.4 percent over the $19.066 billion in the same four-week period in the prior year. Sales for the thirty-nine week period were $203.045 billion, an increase of 11.4 percent over $182.312 billion in the similar period in the prior year.
 
The Wal-Mart Division's sales for the four-week period were $13.915 billion, up 9.4 percent over sales of $12.720 billion in the same four-week period in the prior year. The Division's sales for the thirty-nine weeks of $135.973 billion were up 10.0 percent over $123.578 billion in the similar prior-year period.
 
SAM'S CLUB sales for the four-week period were $2.816 billion, up 6.8 percent over sales of $2.637 billion in the same four-week period in the prior year. Club sales for the thirty-nine weeks of $27.052 billion were up 8.3 percent over the $24.980 billion in the similar prior-year period.

For the November four-week period, we forecast comparative sales for the U.S. to be up in the 2 to 4 percent range.
 
Although sales for the quarter were below our original plan, gross margin exceeded our forecast and a change in our effective tax rate resulting primarily from the retroactive renewal of the work opportunity tax credit will result in earnings for the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2004 coming in at the high end of our forecasted range of $0.52 to $0.54.
 
Our earnings release for the third fiscal quarter is scheduled for Tuesday, November 16, 2004 before the NYSE opens. The dial-in number for the earnings call is 402-998-1748 and will be available for 36 hours after quarterly earnings are announced.

This release contains statements that Wal-Mart believes are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by that Act. These forward-looking statements, which discuss our management's forecast of comparable sales for the November fourweek period and our management's forecast of earnings for our quarter ended October 31, 2004, appear in the two paragraphs immediately following the comparable sales table in this release. They are identified by use of the words "forecast" and "will result." These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, domestically and internationally, including, consumer spending patterns and debt levels, weather conditions, competitive pressures, currency exchange fluctuations, trade restrictions, and other risks. We discuss certain of these matters more fully in our filings with the SEC, including our last Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. This release should be read in conjunction with that Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC through the date of this report. We urge you to consider all of these risks, uncertainties and other factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements. As a result of these matters, including changes in facts, assumptions not being realized or other circumstances, our actual comparable sales for the November four-week period and our earnings for the quarter ended October 31, 2004 may differ materially from forecast comparable sales and forecast earnings discussed in the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included in this release are made only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update the forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
