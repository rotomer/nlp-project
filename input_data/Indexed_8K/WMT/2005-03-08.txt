If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present at that meeting. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list also shall be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of that meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of that meeting. Nothing contained in this Section 6 shall require the Corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on that list.

Unless otherwise required by the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business. Where a separate vote by class or series or classes or series is required, a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or series or classes or series, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter.
Section 8. Adjournment of Meetings. The chair of a meeting of stockholders or the holders of a majority of the voting shares present in person or represented at the meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn a meeting of stockholders. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
Section 9. Voting. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote on each matter, in person or by proxy, for each share of capital stock of the Corporation that has voting power and that is held by the stockholder. When a quorum is present at any meeting of stockholders, all matters shall be determined, adopted and approved by the affirmative vote (which need not be by ballot) of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote with respect to the matter, unless the proposed action is one upon which, by express provision of statutes or of the Certificate of Incorporation, a different vote is specified and required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control with respect to that vote on that matter. Where a separate vote by a class or
 
 
<R> </R>
 
classes is required, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of such class or classes present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class. Notwithstanding the foregoing, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.
Section 10. Proxies. (a) Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for the stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy, the following shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority: (1) a stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy, which may be accomplished by the stockholder or the stockholder's authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing such person's signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means; or (2) a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing an electronic transmission (as defined in Article VIII of these Bylaws) to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization, or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such electronic transmission, provided that any electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. If it is determined that the electronic transmission is valid, the inspectors of election for the meeting or, if there are no inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall specify the information upon which they relied.
(b) Any copy or other reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission authorizing another person or persons to act as proxy for a stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or electronic transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or electronic transmission could be used, provided that such copy or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or electronic transmission.
Section 11. Conduct of Meetings. The Board may adopt rules and regulations for the conduct of any meeting of the stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with any such rules and regulations adopted by the Board, the chair of any meeting of the stockholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe rules and regulations and do all acts, as, in the judgment of that chair, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations, or procedures, whether adopted by the Board or prescribed by the chair of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (1) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (2) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (3) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record, their duly authorized and constituted proxies, or such other persons as the chair of the meeting shall determine; (4) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement; and (5) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by
 
 
<R> </R>
 
participants. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board or the chair of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.
Section 12. Inspectors of Election. The Board shall, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting and make a written report. The Board may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the chair of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of such inspector's ability. The inspectors shall: (1) ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each; (2) determine the shares represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots; (3) count all votes and ballots; (4) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors; and (5) certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and their count of all votes and ballots. The inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist the inspectors in the performance of the duties of the inspectors.
Section 13. Meetings by Remote Communication. If authorized by the Board, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board may adopt, stockholders and proxy holders not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of remote communication, participate in the meeting and be deemed present in person and vote at the meeting, whether such meeting is to be held in a designated place or solely by means of remote communication, provided that (1) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxy holder, (2) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such stockholders and proxy holders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including the opportunity to read or hear the proceedings in the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings and (3) if the stockholder or proxy holder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by the Corporation.
Section 14. Action Without a Meeting. (a) Unless restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders, or any action that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote were present and voted and such consent or consents are delivered to the Corporation in the manner prescribed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Every written consent shall bear the date of the signature of each stockholder, and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated consent, written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take action are delivered to the Corporation in the manner prescribed by the Delaware General Corporation Law.
 
 
<R> </R> <R> </R>
 
 
(b) An electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or proxy holder, or by a person authorized to act for a stockholder or proxy holder, shall be deemed to be written, signed, and dated for purposes of this Section 14, provided that any electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the Corporation can determine: (1) that the electronic transmission was transmitted by the stockholder, or proxy holder; and (2) the date on which the stockholder, proxy holder or authorized person or persons transmitted the electronic transmission. The date on which the electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the date that the consent was signed. No consent given by electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until such consent is reproduced in paper form and delivered to the Corporation in the manner prescribed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on delivery, consents given by electronic transmission may be otherwise delivered to the principal place of business of the Corporation or to the Secretary of the Corporation to the extent and in the manner provided by the Board. Any copy or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be substituted for or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all purposes for which the original writing could be used, provided that such copy or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing.
(c) Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who did not consent in writing and who would have been entitled to notice if the action had been taken at a meeting having a record date on the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to the Corporation

INDEMNIFICATION
 
Section 1. Indemnification. (a) Subject to Section 3 of this Article VI, the Corporation shall indemnify, to the full extent that it shall have power under applicable law to do so and in a manner permitted by such law, any person made or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, lawsuit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
 
<R> </R>
 
or other enterprise, including service with respect to an associate benefit plan (collectively, "another enterprise").
 
(b) The Corporation may indemnify, to the full extent that it shall have power under applicable law to do so and in a manner permitted by such law, any person made or threatened to be made a party to any proceeding, by reason of the fact that such person is or was an associate or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as an employee or agent of another enterprise.
 
Section 2. Advancement of Expenses. (a) Subject to Section 3 of this Article VI, with respect to any person made or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed proceeding, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another enterprise, the Corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by such person in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (an "advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that any advancement of expenses shall be made only upon receipt of a written agreement by such person to repay all amounts advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such person is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Article VI or otherwise.
 
(b) With respect to any person made or threatened to be made a party to any proceeding, by reason of the fact that such person is or was an associate or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as an employee or agent of another enterprise, the Corporation may, in its discretion and upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Corporation deems appropriate, pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by such person in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition.
 
Section 3. Actions Initiated Against the Corporation. Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 1(a) or Section 2(a) of this Article VI to the contrary, and except as provided in Section 5(b) of this Article VI with respect to a proceeding initiated against the Corporation by a director or officer of the Corporation (or by a person serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another enterprise), the Corporation shall not be required to indemnify or to advance expenses (including attorneys' fees) to such person in connection with prosecuting the proceeding (or part thereof) or in defending any counterclaim, cross-claim, affirmative defense or like claim of the Corporation in such proceeding (or part thereof) unless the proceeding was authorized by the Board.
 
Section 4. Contract Rights. With respect to any person made or threatened to be made a party to any proceeding, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another enterprise, the rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in Sections 1(a) and 2(a) of this Article VI shall be contract rights. Any amendment, repeal, modification, or adoption of any provision inconsistent with this Article VI shall not adversely affect any right to indemnification or advancement of expenses granted to any person pursuant to this Article VI with respect to any act or omission of the
 
<R> </R>
 
person occurring prior to the time of such amendment, repeal, modification, or adoption (regardless of whether the proceeding relating to such acts or omissions is commenced before or after the time of such amendment, repeal, modification, or adoption).
 
Section 5. Claims. (a) If a claim under Section 1(a) of this Article VI with respect to any right to indemnification is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days after a written demand has been received by the Corporation or a claim under Section 2(a) of this Article VI with respect to any right to the advancement of expenses is not paid in full by the Corporation within 20 days after a written demand has been received by the Corporation, then the person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses may at any time thereafter bring a lawsuit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim.
 
(b) If successful in whole or in part in any lawsuit brought pursuant to Section 5(a) of this Article VI, or in a lawsuit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses, the person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification or an advancement of expenses or the person from whom the Corporation sought to recover an advancement of expenses shall be entitled to be paid by the Corporation the reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) of prosecuting or defending such lawsuit.
 
(c) In any lawsuit brought by a person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification (but not a lawsuit brought by a person seeking to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses), it shall be a defense that the person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification has not met any applicable standard for indemnification under applicable law. With respect to any lawsuit brought by a person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification or right to advancement of expenses, or any lawsuit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses, neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to commencement of such lawsuit that indemnification of such person is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standards of conduct under applicable law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation that such person has not met such applicable standards of conduct, shall create a presumption that such person has not met the applicable standards of conduct or, in a case brought by such person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification, be a defense to such lawsuit.
 
(d) In any lawsuit brought by a person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses, the burden shall be on the Corporation to prove that the person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses or the person from whom the Corporation seeks to recover an advancement of expenses is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such an advancement of expenses, under this Article VI or otherwise.
 
Section 6. Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification. Any indemnification required or permitted under this Article VI (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director, officer, associate, or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met all applicable standards of conduct set forth in this
 
<R> </R> <R> </R>
 
Article VI and Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer of the Corporation at the time of the determination: (1) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, lawsuit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum; (2) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum; (3) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion; or (4) by the stockholders. Such determination shall be made, with respect to any person who is not a director or officer of the Corporation at the time of such determination, in the manner determined by the Board (including in such manner as may be set forth in any general or specific action of the Board applicable to indemnification claims by such person) or in the manner set forth in any agreement to which such person and the Corporation are parties.
 
Section 7. Non-Exclusive Rights. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided in this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any person may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be such director, officer, associate, or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of such person.
 
Section 8. Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, associate, or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article VI or otherwise.
 
Section 9. Severability. If any provision or provisions of this Article VI shall be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (1) the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article VI (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph or clause containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired; and (2) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article VI (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph or clause containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable.
