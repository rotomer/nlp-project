The material terms of the Notes are described in (i) the prospectus supplement of the Company dated August 8, 2005, which relates to the offer and sale of the Notes (the "Prospectus Supplement") and supplements the Company's prospectus dated July 19, 2005, which prospectus relates to the offer and sale from time to time of up to $5,000,000,000 of the Company's debt securities (the "Prospectus"), and (ii) in the Prospectus. The Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus were filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on August 10, 2005 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) of the Commission promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes.
 
The Notes will be delivered in book-entry form only and will be represented by two global notes, one of which will be in the original principal amount of $500,000,000 and the other of which will be in the original principal amount of $300,000,000 (the "Global Notes"). Each of the Global Notes will be payable to CEDE & Co., as the nominee of The Depository Trust Company. The Global Notes will be executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee.
 
Filed as exhibits to this Current Report on Form 8-K are (i) the Pricing Agreement, (ii) the Underwriting Agreement that was entered into by the Company and Goldman, Sachs & Co. to establish the form of underwriting agreement to be entered into by the Company and the underwriters, and the provisions of which will be incorporated by reference into each pricing agreement entered into by the Company and the underwriters, in connection with underwritten offers and sales of the Company's debt securities pursuant to the Registration Statement, (iii) the Indenture, (iv) the Series Terms Certificate that relates to the Series, that was executed in accordance with the Indenture and that evidences the establishment of the terms and conditions of the Series in accordance with the Indenture, (v) the form of the Global Notes and (vi) the opinion of Andrews Kurth LLP regarding the legality of the Notes.

(f) On or after the date of the applicable Pricing Agreement (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities (including, without limitation, any guaranteed debt securities) by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities;

8. . (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities or included in the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement to any thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities or included in the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement to any thereof, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter of any Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented.
Indemnification and Contribution
provided, however,
 
(b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities or included in the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement to any thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the Statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any
 
Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities or included in the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement to any thereof, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Designated Securities, and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such Section, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such Section. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other shall reasonable costs of investigation.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 8(c), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statement or omissions that resulted in such losses claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative
 
fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this Section 8(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Designated Securities and are not joint.
 
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability that the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director and officer of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
 
9. . (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities that it has agreed to purchase under the applicable Pricing Agreement, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein and therein. In the event that, within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter, the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the
Defaulting Underwriters
 
Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus that in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 9 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the applicable Pricing Agreement.
 
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in Section 9(a), the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the applicable Pricing Agreement and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities or a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in Section 9(a), the aggregate principal amount or Designated Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, as referred to in Section 9(b), or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in Section 9(b) to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the applicable Pricing Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
10. . The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company or any director or officer or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Designated Securities with respect to which such indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements are made or given.
Survival
 
11. . If the applicable Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason the Designated Securities are not
Termination
 
delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof.
 
12. . In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the applicable Pricing Agreement.
Authority of Representatives
 
13. . The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Designated Securities pursuant to this Agreement and the applicable Pricing Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and the applicable Pricing Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it shall not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
Nature of Underwriters' Obligations
 
14. . All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Company, shall be delivered or sent by mail, air courier or facsimile transmission (which shall be effective upon confirmation by telephone) to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Chief Executive Officer, with a copy to the General Counsel of the Company; and, if to the Underwriters, shall be delivered or sent by mail, air courier or facsimile transmission (which shall be effective upon confirmation by telephone) to the address or addresses of the Representative or Representatives, as the case may be, as set forth in the Pricing Agreement, , that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail telex or facsimile transmission (which shall be effective upon confirmation by telephone) to such Underwriter at its address which, if not set forth in the applicable Pricing Agreement, will be supplied to the Company by the Representative or Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon the addressee's receipt thereof.
Notices

15. . This Agreement and the applicable Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the
Persons Entitled to the Benefit of Agreement
 
Company and, to the extent provided in Section 8 and Section 10 hereof, the directors and officers of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective successors and assigns (including, in the case of natural persons, their respective heirs, executors and administrators), and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or the applicable Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.

(g) Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by one or more duly appointed agents, each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such principal amount. Any notice given or action taken by a Holder or its agents with regard to different parts of such principal amount pursuant to this paragraph shall have the same effect as if given or taken by separate Holders of each such different part.
 
(h) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 or pursuant to one or more Supplemental Indentures, a Holder, including a Depositary that is the Holder of a Global Security, may make, give or take, by a proxy or proxies duly appointed in writing, any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided in this Indenture to be made, given or taken by Holders, and a Depositary that is the Holder of a Global Security may provide its proxy or proxies to the beneficial owners of interests in any such Global Security through such Depositary's standing instructions and customary practices.
 
(i) The Company may fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Persons who are beneficial owners of interests in any Global Security held by a Depositary entitled under the procedures of such Depositary to make, give or take, by a proxy or proxies duly appointed in writing, any request, demand, authorization, direction,
 
notice, consent, waiver or other action provided in this Indenture to be made, given or taken by Holders. If such a record date is fixed, the Holders on such record date or their duly appointed proxy or proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to make, give or take such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date. No such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action shall be valid or effective if made, given or taken more than 90 days after such record date.
 
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with:
SECTION 1.05. Notices, etc., to Trustee and Company.
 
(i) the Trustee by any Holder or by the Company shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with the Trustee at its Principal Corporate Trust Office, Attention: Corporate Trustee Administration Department; or
 
(ii) the Company by any Holder or by the Trustee shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, by certified or registered mail, with the postage prepaid, to the Company, to the attention of its Treasurer, or by an overnight delivery service that provides for confirmed receipts of delivery addressed to it at the address of its principal office specified in the first paragraph of this Indenture or at any other address previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Company.
 
Where this Indenture or any Security provides for notice to Holders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein or in such Security expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first class, postage prepaid, to each Holder of Registered Securities affected by such event, at the Holder's address as it appears in the Registry, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice to Holders of Registered Securities by mail, then such notification as shall be made at a time and in a manner approved by the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder. In any case where notice to Holders of Registered Securities is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder of Registered Securities shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders of Registered Securities.
SECTION 1.06. Notices to Holders; Waiver.
 
Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
 
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, or waiver required or permitted under this Indenture shall be in the English language, except that any published notice may be in an official language of the country of publication.
SECTION 1.07. Language of Notices, etc.
 
If and to the extent that any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with the duties imposed by, or with another provision (an "incorporated provision") included in this Indenture by operation of, Sections 310 to 318, inclusive, of the TIA, such imposed duties or incorporated provision shall control.
SECTION 1.08. Conflict with Trust Indenture Act.
 
The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the construction hereof.
SECTION 1.09. Effect of Headings and Table of Contents.
 
All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by the Company shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not.
SECTION 1.10. Successors and Assigns.
 
In case any provision in this Indenture or in the Securities of any Series shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
SECTION 1.11. Severability Clause.
 
Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors hereunder and the Holders, any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture.
SECTION 1.12. Benefits of Indenture.
 
Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to any Series of Securities, in any case where any Interest Payment Date, Stated Maturity, Repurchase Date or Redemption Date of any Security or any date on which any Defaulted Interest is proposed to be paid shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provisions of the Securities or this Indenture) payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Securities need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date, Stated Maturity, Repurchase Date or Redemption Date or on the date on which Defaulted Interest is proposed to be paid, and, if such payment is made, no interest shall accrue on such payment for the period from and after any such Interest Payment Date, Stated Maturity, Repurchase Date or Redemption Date, or date on which Defaulted Interest is proposed to be paid, as the case may be.
SECTION 1.13. Legal Holidays.
 
This Indenture and each of the Securities shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of New York.
SECTION 1.14. Governing Law.
 
Each of the parties hereto agrees that any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or based upon this Indenture, the Securities or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, may be instituted in any of the courts of the State of New York and the United States District Courts, in each case located in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York. In addition, each such party irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court and irrevocably waives any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each such party hereby irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Indenture, the Securities or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Each such party agrees that final judgment in any suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court shall be conclusive and binding upon it and may be enforced in any court to whose jurisdiction it is subject by a suit upon such judgment.
SECTION 1.15. Submission to Jurisdiction.
 
For purposes of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any of the foregoing courts, the Company irrevocably designates CT Corporation System, whose address on the date hereof is 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10011, U.S.A., to receive for and on behalf of it and its property service of copies of the summons and complaints and any other process, by personal service or by mail, which may be served in any such suit, action or proceeding. Such service may be made by mailing or delivering a copy of such process to such agent at the above address. In the event that such agent for service of process resigns or ceases to serve as the agent of the Company, the Company agrees to give notice (as provided herein) to the Trustee of the name and address of any new agent for service of process with respect to it appointed hereunder. The Company agrees that the failure of its agent for service of process to forward such service to it shall not impair or affect the validity of such service or of any judgment based thereof.
 
If, despite the foregoing, in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any of the aforesaid courts, there is for any reason no such agent for service of process for each of the parties available to be served, then to the extent that service of process by mail shall then be permitted by applicable law, each of such parties further irrevocably consents to the service of process on it in any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court by the mailing thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to it at its address given in or pursuant to Section 1.05 hereof.
 
Nothing herein contained shall preclude any party from effecting service of process in any lawful manner or from bringing any suit, action or proceeding in respect of this Indenture in any other state, country or jurisdiction.
 
To the extent that the Company may in any jurisdiction claim for itself or its property any immunity from suit, execution, attachment (whether in aid of execution, before judgment or otherwise) or other legal process and to the extent that in any such jurisdiction there may be attributed to itself or its property such immunity (whether or not claimed), the Company irrevocably agrees not to claim and irrevocably waives such immunity to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdiction.
 
 
 
(a) All Securities shall have such appropriate terms, insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as are required or permitted by this Indenture, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification and such legends or endorsements placed thereon as may be required to comply with the rules of any securities exchange and the Depositary, if any, for Securities of a Series or as may, consistently herewith, be determined by the Authorized Officers executing such Securities, as evidenced by their execution of the Securities.
SECTION 2.01. Forms Generally.
 
(b) Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to any Series of Securities, the Securities of each Series shall be issuable in registered form without coupons.
 
(c) The Securities shall be printed, typewritten, lithographed or engraved or produced by any combination of these methods on any type of paper, as determined by the officers executing such Securities, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.
 
Each Security in a Series shall be in a form approved by or pursuant to a Supplemental Indenture or a Board Resolution or by an Authorized Officer or Authorized Officers pursuant to authority delegated to that Authorized Officer or those Authorized Officers pursuant to a Board Resolution. If the form of the Securities of a Series is not prescribed by the Supplemental Indenture relating to that Series, upon or prior to the delivery to the Trustee for authentication of the first Security to be issued of that Series, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee, the Board Resolution by or pursuant to which such form of the Security for that Series has been approved, which Board Resolution shall have attached thereto a copy of the form of the Security approved, or a certificate of an Authorized Officer, attested to by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company, certifying that an Authorized Officer, acting pursuant to delegated authority from the Board of Directors, approved the form of the Securities of that Series and attaching a copy of the form of the Security approved and a true and complete copy of the resolutions of the Board of Directors delegating authority to that Authorized Officer to approve the form of Securities. If temporary Securities of any Series are issued in global form as permitted by Section 3.05, the form thereof also shall be established as provided in this Section 2.02.
SECTION 2.02. Form of Securities.
 
The Trustee's certificates of authentication on the Securities issued pursuant to this Indenture shall be in substantially the following form:
SECTION 2.03. Form of Trustee's Certificate of Authentication.
 
 
This is one of the Securities of the Series designated herein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
If Securities of a Series are issuable in whole or in part in global form, as specified as contemplated by Section 3.01, then, notwithstanding clause (xiv) of Section 3.01 and the provisions of Section 3.02, such Global Security shall represent such of the outstanding Securities of that Series as shall be specified in such Global Security and may provide that it shall represent the aggregate amount of Outstanding Securities from time to time endorsed thereon and that the aggregate amount of Outstanding Securities represented thereby may from time to time be reduced or increased to reflect exchanges or partial redemptions or increased to reflect the issuance of additional uncertificated Securities of that Series. Any endorsement of a Global Security to reflect the amount, or any increase or decrease in the amount, of Outstanding Securities of a Series represented thereby shall be made in such manner and upon instructions given by such Person or Persons as shall be specified therein or in the Company Order to be delivered to the Trustee pursuant to Section 3.03 or Section 3.05.
SECTION 2.04. Global Securities.
 
Global Securities shall be issued in registered form and in either temporary or permanent form.
 
 
 
The aggregate principal amount of Securities that may be authenticated and delivered under this Indenture is unlimited. The Company may issue up to the aggregate principal amount of Securities from time to time authorized by or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions of the Company.
SECTION 3.01. Terms of Securities.
 
The Securities of the Company may be issued in one or more Series. All Securities of each Series issued under this Indenture shall in all respects be equally and ratably entitled to the benefits hereof with respect to that Series without preference, priority or distinction on account of the actual time or times of the authentication and delivery or Maturity of the Securities of such Series. Unless expressly provided otherwise with respect to a Series, not all Securities of a Series need be issued at the same time, and, unless otherwise provided in the Securities of that Series or in this Indenture, a Series may be reopened and the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a Series may be increased and additional Securities of that Series may be issued up to a maximum aggregate principal amount authorized for that Series, as that maximum aggregate principal amount may be increased from time to time. All Securities of a Series shall rank equally among themselves and with the other existing and future unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company.
 
The Company may from time to time establish one or more Series pursuant to this Indenture. A Series shall be established by (1) the execution and delivery of a Supplemental Indenture or (2) the adoption of a Board Resolution by the Board of Directors establishing that Series. The specific terms and conditions of the Securities of any Series established shall be determined and set either (1) by the Supplemental Indenture that establishes the Series, (2) if the Series is established by a Supplemental Indenture, to the extent that those specific terms and conditions are not determined and set by that Supplemental Indenture, by the adoption of a Board Resolution or Board Resolutions by the Board of Directors and, to the extent that those specific terms and conditions are not determined and set by the Supplemental Indenture or by the adoption of a Board Resolution or Board Resolutions by the Board of Directors or by a combination of those means of determining and setting the specific terms and conditions of the Securities of that Series, by the action of one or more Authorized Officers pursuant to authority to determine and set the specific terms and conditions of the Securities of that Series specifically delegated by the Board of Directors to that Authorized Officer or those Authorized Officers or (3) if the Series is established by action of the Board of Directors, to the extent that those specific terms and conditions are not set by the adoption of a Board Resolution or Board Resolutions by the Board of Directors, by the action of one or more Authorized Officers pursuant to authority to determine and set the specific terms and conditions of the Securities of that Series specifically delegated by the Board of Directors to that Authorized Officer or those Authorized Officers. If the specific terms and specific conditions of the Securities of a Series are determined and set by action of the Board of Directors, that action shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution. If the specific terms and conditions of the Securities of a Series established by action of the Board of Directors are determined and set by an Authorized Officer or Authorized Officers pursuant to authority delegated to them by the Board of Directors, that action shall be evidenced by a certificate executed by the Authorized Officer or Authorized Officers determining and setting those terms and conditions, which certificate shall also be attested to by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company (a "Series Terms Certificate"). If the specific terms and conditions of the Securities of a Series established by action of the Board of Directors are determined and set by an Authorized Officer or Authorized Officers pursuant to authority delegated to them by the Board of Directors and a Series Terms Certificate has been delivered in connection with the establishment of the terms and conditions of the Securities of a Series and the issuance of the Securities of that Series, an additional Series Term Certificate shall not be required to be delivered in connection with any subsequent issuance of additional Securities of that Series.
 
Upon a Series being established and the specific terms and conditions of the Securities of that Series being determined and set otherwise than through a Supplemental Indenture, the Company shall cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate of the Company signed by an Authorized Officer and attested to by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Company certifying that the Series has been established and the specific terms and conditions of the Securities of the Series have been determined and set and attaching to that Officers' Certificate (1) the Board Resolution establishing the Series, (2) the Board Resolution or Board Resolutions determining and setting the specific terms and conditions of the Securities of that Series or providing for the delegation of authority to one or more Authorized Officers to determine and set the specific terms and conditions of the Securities of that Series and (3) if an Authorized Officer or Authorized Officers has determined and set the specific terms and conditions of the Securities of that Series, attaching the Series Terms Certificate evidencing the action of that Authorized Officer or
 
those Authorized Officers. The Officers' Certificate of the Company that is required to be delivered to the Trustee in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, may be provided before or at the time of the consummation of the first issuance of Securities of the Series to which the Officers' Certificate relates.
 
Each Board Resolution of the Company determining and setting the specific terms and conditions of the Securities of a Series and each Series Terms Certificate shall set forth therein, and each Supplemental Indenture setting forth the terms and conditions of the Securities of a Series, shall set forth the following information as to the terms and conditions of that Series:

SECTION 3.02. Denominations.
 
SECTION 3.03. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.
 
(a) The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by one of its Authorized Officers or such other officer or agent to which the authority to execute such Securities is delegated by the Board of Directors, and by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. The signatures of any or all of these officers or agents on the Securities may be manual or facsimile. Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers or authorized agents of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that one or more of those individuals have ceased to hold a proper office prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices or, in the case of an agent, continue to have proper authority at the date of such Securities.
 
(b) At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any Series, executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order, for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of the Company Order, authenticate and deliver such Securities as this Indenture provides and not otherwise.
 
If the Company shall establish pursuant to Section 3.01 that the Securities of a Series are to be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities, then the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with this Section and a Company Order of the Company for the authentication and delivery of such Global Securities with respect to that Series, authenticate and deliver one or more Global Securities in permanent or temporary form, and such Global Securities (i) shall represent and shall be denominated in an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such Series to be represented by one or more Global Securities, (ii) shall be registered, if in registered form, in the name of the Depositary for such Global Security or Global Securities or the nominee of such Depositary, and (iii) shall be delivered by the Trustee to such Depositary or pursuant to such Depositary's instructions.
 
Each Depositary designated pursuant to Section 3.01 for a Global Security in registered form must, at the time of its designation and at all times while it serves as Depositary, be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and any other applicable statute or regulation.
 
In authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 8.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon,
 
(a) an Officers' Certificate required pursuant to Section 3.01;
 
(b) a Company Order of the Company; and
 
(c) an Opinion of Counsel complying with Section 1.02 and stating that:
 
(i) the form of such Securities has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
 
(ii) the terms of such Securities or the manner of determining such terms, have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
 
(iii) that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and to general principles of equity; and
 
(iv) such other matters as the Trustee may reasonably request.
 
The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate any Securities if the issuance of the Securities pursuant to the Indenture will adversely affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner that is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.01 and of this Section 3.03, if all Securities of a Series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Board Resolution of the Company or Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 3.01 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to this Section 3.03 at or prior to the time of authentication of each Security of such Series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such Series to be issued and such documents reasonably contemplate the issuance of all Securities of such Series; provided that any subsequent request by the Company to the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such Series upon original issuance shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Company that as of the date of such request, the statements made in the Officers' Certificate or other certificates delivered pursuant to Sections 1.02 and 3.01 shall be true and correct as if made on such date.
 
A Company Order, Officers' Certificate, Board Resolution or Supplemental Indenture delivered by the Company to the Trustee in the circumstances set forth in the preceding paragraph may provide that Securities that are the subject thereof will be authenticated and delivered by the Trustee or its agent on original issue from time to time in the aggregate principal amount, if any, established for such Series pursuant to such procedures acceptable to the Trustee as may be specified from time to time by a Company Order upon telephonic (promptly confirmed in writing), electronic or written order of Persons designated in that Company Order, Officers' Certificate, Supplemental Indenture or Board Resolution and that such Persons are authorized to determine, consistent with that Company Order, Officers' Certificate, Supplemental Indenture or Board Resolution, those terms and conditions of said Securities as are specified in that Company Order, Officers' Certificate, Supplemental Indenture or Board Resolution.
 
Each Registered Security shall be dated the date of its authentication, and unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01, any temporary Global Security referred to in Section 3.05 shall be dated as of the date of original issuance of that Security.
 
No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture endorsed thereon or be valid or obligatory for any purpose, unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature of an authorized officer, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security or portion thereof shall have been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 3.10 together with a written statement (that need not comply with Section 1.02 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security or portion thereof has never been issued and sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
 
(a) The Company will maintain an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, where Securities issued by it may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange ("Registrar") and an office or agency where Securities may be presented and surrendered for payment ("Paying Agent"). The Registrar shall keep a register of the Securities issued by the Company ("Registry") and of their transfer and exchange. The Company may appoint one or more co-registrars and
SECTION 3.04. Registrar, Paying Agent and Depositary.
 
one or more additional paying agents for the Securities of each Series issued by it. The term "Registrar" includes any co-registrar, and the term "Paying Agent" includes any additional paying agent. The Company may change any Paying Agent or Registrar with respect to the Securities of any Series that it issues without notice to any Holder. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the name and address of any Paying Agent not a party to this Indenture. If the Company fails to appoint or maintain another entity as Registrar or Paying Agent for the affected Series of Securities, the Trustee shall act as that Registrar or Paying Agent, as the case may be. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar.
 
(b) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries acts as Paying Agent for any Series, each such Paying Agent shall segregate and hold in a separate trust fund for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities of that Series all money held by it as Paying Agent with respect to the Securities of that Series. Upon any bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings relating to the Company, the Trustee shall serve as Paying Agent for the Securities issued by the Company.
 
(c) If the Securities of a Series are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange or any other stock exchange located outside the United States and such stock exchange shall so require, the Company will maintain a Paying Agent for the Securities of that Series in Dublin, Ireland or any other required city located outside the United States, so long as the Securities of that Series are listed on such exchange, and subject to any laws or regulations applicable thereto, in a Place of Payment for Securities of that Series located outside the United States an office for registration of transfer or exchange of Securities of that Series.
 
(a) If the Definitive Securities of any Series are to be printed on paper with engraved borders or engraved, then pending the preparation of Definitive Securities of that Series, the Company may execute, and upon the receipt of a Company Order and the receipt of the certifications and opinions required under Sections 3.01 and 3.03, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities that are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denominations, substantially of the tenor of the Definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued in registered form and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.
SECTION 3.05. Temporary Securities.
 
 
(i) Except in the case of temporary Securities in global form, each of which shall be exchanged in accordance with the provisions of the following paragraphs, if temporary Securities of any Series are issued, the Company will cause Definitive Securities of such Series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of Definitive Securities, the temporary Securities of such Series shall be exchangeable for Definitive Securities of such Series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such Series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that Series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any Series, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of Definitive Securities of such Series of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any Series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as Definitive Securities of such Series.
 
(ii) Without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the date specified in, or determined pursuant to the terms of, any such temporary Global Security as the "Global Exchange Date" (the "Global Exchange Date"), the Company shall deliver to the Trustee, or, if the Trustee appoints an Authenticating Agent pursuant to Section 8.14, to any such Authenticating Agent, Definitive Securities in aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such temporary Global Security, executed by the Company. On or after the Global Exchange Date, such temporary Global Security shall be surrendered by the Depositary to the Trustee or any such Authenticating Agent, as the Company's agent for such purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or from time to time in part, for Definitive Securities without charge and the Trustee or any such Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for each portion of such temporary Global Security, an equal aggregate principal amount of Definitive Securities of the same Series, of authorized denominations and of like tenor as the portion of such temporary Global Security to be exchanged.
 
(iii) Upon any exchange of a portion of any such temporary Global Security, such temporary Global Security shall be endorsed by the Trustee or any such Authenticating Agent, as the case may be, to
 
reflect the reduction of the principal amount evidenced thereby, whereupon its remaining principal amount shall be reduced for all purposes by the amount so exchanged. Until so exchanged in full, such temporary Global Security shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as Definitive Securities of such Series authenticated and delivered hereunder.
 
SECTION 3.06. Transfer and Exchange.
 
(a) Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of any Series at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose, the Company shall execute, and upon receipt of an authentication order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same Series of any authorized denomination or denominations, of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. At the option of the Holder, Securities of any Series (other than a Global Security) may be exchanged for other Securities of the same Series of any authorized denomination or denominations of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose. Upon receipt at such office or agency of an appropriate request for exchange, the Company shall execute, and upon receipt of an authentication order from the Company, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the exchanging Holder, one or more new Securities of the appropriate Series of any authorized denomination or denominations of like tenor and aggregate principal amount to the Securities surrendered for exchange. Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company, the Registrar or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Registrar and the Trustee duly executed, by the Holder thereof or the Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing.
 
(b) Upon the issuance of a Global Security, the Depositary or its nominee will credit, on its book-entry registration and transfer system, the respective principal amounts of the individual Securities represented by the Global Security to the accounts of institutions that have accounts with the Depositary. The institutional accounts to be credited may be designated by the underwriter, underwriters, agent or agents for such Securities or, if the Securities are offered and sold directly by the Company, by the Company. Upon receipt of any payment in respect of a Global Security, the Depositary or its nominee will immediately credit the institutional accounts with amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the Global Security as shown in the records of the Depositary or its nominee.
 
(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Definitive Securities, a Global Security representing all or a portion of the Securities of a Series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such Series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such Series or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
 
(d) If at any time the Depositary for the Securities of a Series notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the Securities of such Series or if at any time the Depositary for the Securities of such Series shall no longer be eligible under Section 3.03(b), the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the Securities of such Series.
 
(e) The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that Securities of any Series issued in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Security or Global Securities. In such event, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of Securities of such Series, will authenticate and deliver, certificated Securities of such Series ("Definitive Securities") in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Global Securities representing Securities of such Series in exchange for such Global Security or Global Securities. In addition, Definitive Securities shall be transferred to all beneficial owners in exchange for their benefit interests in a Global Security if (a) a successor depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the Company's receipt of notice described in Section 3.06(d) above or (b) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Trustee has received a request from the Depositary for the issuance of Definitive Securities representing the Securities of such Series.
 
(f) If specified by the Company pursuant to Section 3.01 with respect to a Series of Securities, the Depositary for such Series of Securities may surrender a Global Security for such Series of Securities in exchange in whole or in part for Definitive Securities of such Series on such terms as are acceptable to the Company and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and
 
deliver, without service charge: (1) to each Person specified by such Depositary a new definitive Security or Securities of the same Series of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Security; and (2) to such Depositary a new Global Security in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of Definitive Securities delivered to Holders thereof.
 
(g) Upon the exchange of a Global Security for Definitive Securities, such Global Security shall be cancelled by the Trustee. Definitive Securities exchanged for portions of a Global Security pursuant to this Section 3.06 shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect Participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
 
(h) No service charge shall be made to a holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Security or to a Holder of a Definitive Security for any registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than any such transfer taxes or similar governmental charge payable upon exchange or transfer pursuant to Sections 3.05 and 4.07).
 
(i) All Global Securities and Definitive Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Global Securities or Definitive Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same indebtedness, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Global Securities or Definitive Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
 
(j) The Registrar shall not be required (A) to issue, to register the transfer of or to exchange any Securities during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of any selection of Securities for redemption under Section 4.03 and ending at the close of business on the day of selection, (B) to register the transfer of or to exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part or (C) to register the transfer of or to exchange a Security between a Record Date and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date.
 
(k) Prior to due presentment for the registration of a transfer of any Security, the Trustee, any Paying Agent and the Company may deem and treat the Person in whose name any Security is registered as the absolute owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Securities, payment of the redemption price of the Securities and for all other purposes, and none of the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Company shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
(l) The Trustee shall authenticate Global Securities and Definitive Securities in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.03.
 
If (i) any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee or the Registrar, or if the Company, the Trustee and the Registrar receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) there is delivered to the Company, the Trustee and the Registrar such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company, the Trustee or the Registrar that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same Series and Stated Maturity and of like tenor and principal amount, bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
SECTION 3.07. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
 
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
 
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section 3.07, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
 
Every new Security of any Series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture, equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of the same Series duly issued hereunder.
 
The provisions of this Section 3.07 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the placement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
 
(a) Unless otherwise provided for by the terms of the Securities of any Series as established in accordance with Section 3.01, interest on any Registered Security that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date shall unless otherwise provided in that Security be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for that interest payment. At the option of the Company, payment of interest on any Registered Security may be made by check in the currency designated for such payment pursuant to the terms of such Registered Security mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Registry or by wire transfer to an account in such currency designated by such Person in writing not later than 10 days prior to the date of such payment.
SECTION 3.08. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
 
(b) Any interest on any Registered Security that is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of such Person having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (i) or clause (ii) below.
 
(i) The Company may elect to make payments of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names any such Registered Securities (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which Special Record Date shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Registered Security and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which Special Record Date shall be not more than 15 nor less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first class, postage prepaid, to each Holder at the Holder's address as it appears in the Registry, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names such Registered Securities (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (ii) of this Section 3.08.
 
(ii) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities with respect to which there exists such default may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
 
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.08, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, that were carried by such other Security.
 
SECTION 3.09. Persons Deemed Owners.
 
(a) Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of any Registered Security, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of, premium, if any, and, subject to Section 3.08, interest on such Security, and for all purposes whatsoever, whether or not that Security is overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
(b) None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent, any Authenticating Agent or the Registrar will have the responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interest of a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interest, and they shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting on any such information provided by the Depositary.
 
Unless otherwise provided with respect to a Series of Securities, all Securities surrendered for payment, registration of transfer, exchange, repayment or redemption shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee. All Securities so delivered or surrendered directly to the Trustee for any such purpose shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder that the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture or such Securities. All cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of by the Trustee in accordance with the Trustee's customary procedures, and the Trustee shall deliver a certificate of such disposition to the Company.
SECTION 3.10. Cancellation.
 
Interest on the Securities of each Series shall be computed as shall be specified in the terms of those Securities as established in accordance with Section 3.01; that if the terms of any Securities do not provide a method for computation of interest with respect thereto, interest on that Security shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
SECTION 3.11. Computation of Interest.
provided, however,
 
The Company may provide, pursuant to Section 3.01, for the Securities of any Series that, to the fullest extent possible under applicable law and except as may otherwise be specified as contemplated in Section 3.01, (a) the obligation, if any, of the Company to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities of any Series in a Foreign Currency, composite currency or Dollars (the "Designated Currency") as may be specified pursuant to Section 3.01 is of the essence and agrees that judgments in respect of such Securities shall be given in the Designated Currency; (b) the obligation of the Company to make payments in the Designated Currency of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Securities shall, notwithstanding any payment in any other currency, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, be discharged only to the extent of the amount in the Designated Currency that the Holder receiving such payment may, in accordance with normal banking procedures, purchase with the sum paid in such other currency, after any premium and cost of exchange, in the country of issue of the Designated Currency in the case of Foreign Currency or Dollars or in the international banking community in the case of a composite currency on the Business Day immediately following the day on which such Holder receives such payment; (c) if the amount in the Designated Currency that may be so purchased for any reason falls short of the amount originally due, the Company shall pay such additional amounts as may be necessary to compensate for such shortfall; and (d) any obligation of the Company not discharged by such payment shall be due as a separate and independent obligation and, until discharged as provided herein, shall continue in full force and effect.
SECTION 3.12. Currency Indemnity.
 
The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP," "ISIN," or "Common Code" numbers or other Euroclear or Clearstream reference numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use such numbers in notices of redemption or other related material as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice or other related material may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption or other related material and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any change in any such reference number.
SECTION 3.13. CUSIP Numbers.
 
If made a part of the terms of the Securities of a Series in accordance with Section 3.01 with respect to Securities represented by a Global Security, Securities of a Series may be issued initially in book-entry only form and, if issued in such form, shall be represented by one or more Global Securities registered in the name of the Depositary or other depositary designated with respect thereto. So long as such book-entry only system of registration is in effect, (a) Securities of a Series so issued in book-entry only form will not be issuable in the form of or exchangeable for Securities in certificated or definitive registered form, (b) the records of the Depositary or such other depositary will be determinative for all purposes as to the beneficial owners
SECTION 3.14. Book-Entry Only System.
 
of the Securities of that Series and (c) neither the Company, the Trustee nor any Paying Agent, or Registrar for such Securities will have any responsibility or liability for (i) any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of owners of beneficial interests in the Securities of that Series, (ii) maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial interests, (iii) receipt of notices, voting and requesting or directing the Trustee to take, or not to take, or consenting to, certain actions hereunder, or (iv) the record and procedures of the Depositary or such other depositary, as the case may be.
 
 
 
Securities of any Series that are redeemable before their Stated Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and, except as otherwise set forth in the terms of the Securities of that Series as established in accordance with Section 3.01, in accordance with this Article.
SECTION 4.01. Applicability of Article.
 
The election of the Company to redeem any Securities redeemable at the option of the Company shall be evidenced by an Officers' Certificate. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company, the Company shall, at least 60 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee and the Registrar of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of Securities of such Series to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities (i) prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of those Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, or (ii) pursuant to an election of the Company that is subject to a condition specified in the terms of those Securities, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction or condition.
SECTION 4.02. Election To Redeem; Notice To Trustee.
 
If less than all the Securities of any Series with the same terms are to be redeemed, the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee from the Outstanding Securities of that Series having such terms not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and that may provide for the selection for redemption of portions of the principal amount of Securities of such Series of a denomination equal to or larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of such Series. Unless otherwise provided by the terms of the Securities of any Series so selected for partial redemption, the portions of the principal of Securities of that Series so selected for partial redemption shall be, in the case of Registered Securities, equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, and the principal amount of any such Security that remains outstanding shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of such Series.
SECTION 4.03. Selection by Trustee of Securities To Be Redeemed.
 
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company, the Registrar and the Co-Registrar, if any, in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Security selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
 
For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal of such Security that has been or is to be redeemed.
 
Notice of redemption shall be given in the manner provided in Section 1.06, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed.
SECTION 4.04. Notice of Redemption.
 
All notices of redemption shall state:
 
(i) the Redemption Date;
 
(ii) the Redemption Price;
 
(iii) if less than all Outstanding Securities of any Series having the same terms are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the respective principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be redeemed;
 
(iv) that on the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed, and that interest, if any, thereon shall cease to accrue on and after said date;
 
(v) the place or places where such Securities, maturing after the Redemption Date, are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price;
 
(vi) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case; and
 
(vii) the CUSIP number or the Euroclear or the Clearstream reference numbers (or any other number used by a Depository to identify such Securities), if any, of the Securities to be redeemed.
 
A notice of redemption published as contemplated by Section 1.06 need not identify particular Registered Securities to be redeemed.
 
Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, on Company Request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company.
 
At or prior to the opening of business on any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 5.03) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all the Securities that are to be redeemed on that date.
SECTION 4.05. Deposit of Redemption Price.
 
Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Securities for redemption in accordance with said notice, those Securities surrendered shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price. Installments of interest on Registered Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such on the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 3.08.
SECTION 4.06. Securities Payable on Redemption Date.
 
If any Security called for redemption shall not be paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate borne by such Security, or as otherwise provided in such Security.
 
Any Security that is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Registrar so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar duly executed by, the Holder of such Security or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same Series and Stated Maturity, containing identical terms and conditions, of any authorized denominations as requested by such Holder, in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered.
SECTION 4.07. Securities Redeemed in Part.
 
The Trustee shall not redeem any Securities (unless all Securities then Outstanding are to be redeemed) or commence the giving of any notice of redemption of Securities during the continuance of any Event of Default known to the Trustee, except that where the giving of notice of redemption of any Securities shall theretofore have been made, the Trustee shall redeem such Securities, provided funds are deposited with it for such purpose. Any moneys theretofore or thereafter received by the Trustee shall, during the continuance of such Event of Default, be held in trust for the benefit of the Holders and applied in the manner set forth in Section 7.06; provided, however, that in case such Event of Default shall have been waived as provided herein or otherwise cured, such moneys shall thereafter be held and applied in accordance with the provisions of this Article.
SECTION 4.08. Redemption Suspended During Event of Default.
 
 
 
The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of each Series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities of such Series in accordance with the terms of the Securities of that Series, any coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture. Principal, premium if any, or interest payable with respect to any Securities shall be considered paid on the date due if the Paying Agent holds, or if the Company acts as its own Paying Agent, the Company holds in a segregated account in trust for the Holders due such payment, on the date money sufficient to pay all principal and premium, if any and interest then due. Unless otherwise set forth in the terms of Securities of Series established in accordance with Section 3.01, at the option of the Company, all payments of principal may be paid by check to the registered Holder of the Registered Security or other person entitled thereto against surrender of such Security.
SECTION 5.01. Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest.
 
In addition to the offices and agencies maintained pursuant to Section 3.04, the Company will maintain in each Place of Payment for any Series of Securities as to which it issues Securities, an office or agency where Securities of any Series that are convertible or exchangeable may be surrendered for conversion or exchange, as applicable, and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that Series and this Indenture may be served. Each such office may be the office of any Paying Agent appointed by the Company. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of any such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands where Securities of that Series, if they are convertible or exchangeable, may be surrendered for conversion or exchange, as applicable, and where notices and demands to or upon the Company, in respect of the Securities of that Series and this Indenture may be served.
SECTION 5.02. Maintenance of Office or Agency.
 
The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more Series may be presented or surrendered for any or all of such purposes specified above in this Section. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.
 
If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent for any Series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities of such Series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum in the currency in which the Securities of such Series are payable sufficient to pay the principal, premium or interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided, and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
SECTION 5.03. Money for Security Payments To Be Held in Trust.
 
Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any Series of Securities, it will, at or prior to the opening of business on each due date of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Securities of such Series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum in the currency in which the Securities of such Series are payable sufficient to pay the principal, premium or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal, premium or interest, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
 
The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any Series of Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:
 
(i) hold all sums held by it for the payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on Securities of that Series in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;
 
(ii) give the Trustee notice of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities of such Series) in the making of any payment of principal, premium or interest on the Securities of that Series; and
 
(iii) at any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent.
 
The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent, and, upon such payments by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
 
Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Security of any Series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of that Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company with respect to that Security for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in an Authorized Newspaper in each Place of Payment, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, that shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.
 
If the Securities of a Series provide for the payment of additional amounts, the Company will pay to the Holder of any Security of any Series the additional amounts as provided in the terms of the Securities of that Series. Whenever in this Indenture there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, or in respect of, any Security of any Series or the net proceeds received on the sale or exchange of any Security of any Series, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of additional amounts provided for in this Section to the extent that, in such context, additional amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this Section and express mention of the payment of additional amounts, if applicable, in any provisions hereof shall not be construed as excluding additional amounts in those provisions hereof where such express mention is not made.
SECTION 5.04. Additional Amounts.
 
If the Securities of a Series provide for the payment of additional amounts, at least 10 days prior to the first Interest Payment Date with respect to that Series of Securities (or if the Securities of that Series will not bear interest prior to Maturity, the first day on which a payment of principal, and premium, if any, is made), and at least 10 days prior to each date of payment of principal, and premium, if any, or interest if there has been any change with respect to the matters set forth in the below-mentioned Officers' Certificate, the Company will furnish the Trustee and the Company's Principal Paying Agent or Paying Agents, if other than the Trustee, with an Officers' Certificate instructing the Trustee and such Paying Agent or Paying Agents whether such payment of principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on the Securities of that Series shall be made to Holders of Securities of that Series who are United States Aliens without withholding for or on account of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge described in the Securities of that Series. If any such withholding shall be required, then such Officers' Certificate shall specify by country the amount, if any, required to be withheld on such payments to such Holders of Securities, and the Company will pay to the Trustee or such Paying Agent the additional amounts required by this Section. The Company covenants to indemnify the Trustee and any Paying Agent for, and to hold them harmless against, any loss, liability or reasonable expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on their part arising out of or in connection with actions taken or omitted by any of them in reliance on any Officers' Certificate furnished pursuant to this Section.
 
The Company will deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company, an Officers' Certificate (that need not comply with Section 1.02) (provided, however, that one of the signatories of that Officers' Certificate shall be the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer) stating, as to each signer thereof, that:
SECTION 5.05. Statement as to Compliance.
 
(i) a review of the activities of the Company during such year and of performance under this Indenture and under the terms of the Securities has been made under his supervision; and
 
(ii) to the best of each signer's knowledge, based on such review, (a) the Company has fulfilled all of its obligations and complied with all conditions and covenants under this Indenture and under the terms of the Securities throughout such year, or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment of any such obligation, condition or covenant specifying each such default known to the signer and the nature and status thereof, and (b) no event has occurred and is continuing that is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default, or if such an event has occurred and is continuing, specifying such event known to him and the nature and status thereof.
 
For purposes of this Section 5.05, compliance or default shall be determined without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided for herein.
 
So long as any of the Securities shall be Outstanding, the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence, rights and franchises to carry on its business; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 5.06 shall (i) require the Company to preserve any such right or franchise if the Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and that the loss thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders, (ii) prevent any consolidation or merger of the Company, or any conveyance or transfer of its property and assets substantially as an entirety to any person, permitted by Article Ten, or (iii) prevent the liquidation or dissolution of the Company after any conveyance or transfer of its property and assets substantially as an entirety to any person permitted by Article Ten.
SECTION 5.06. Maintenance of Corporate Existence, Rights and Franchises.
 
 
 
(a) The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of all Holders of the Securities of each Series issued hereunder and shall otherwise comply with TIA 312(a) with respect to each Series of Securities issued hereunder. If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish, or shall cause the Registrar (if other than the Company) to furnish, to the Trustee at least seven Business Days before each Interest Payment Date and at such other times as the Trustee may reasonably request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of the Holders of the Securities of that Series, and the Company shall otherwise comply with TIA 312(a) with respect to the Securities of that Series. The Trustee may destroy any list furnished to it as provided in this Section 6.01 upon receipt of a new list so furnished.
SECTION 6.01. Preservation of Information; Communications to Holders; Communications Between Holders.
 
(b) If three or more Holders of Securities of any Series (hereinafter referred to as "applicants") apply in writing to the Trustee, and furnish to the Trustee reasonable proof that each such applicant has owned a Security of such Series for a period of at least six months preceding the date of such application, and such application states that the applicants desire to communicate with other Holders of Securities of such Series or with the Holders of all Securities with respect to their rights under this Indenture or under such Securities and is accompanied by a copy of the form of proxy or other communication that such applicants propose to transmit, then the Trustee shall, within five Business Days after the receipt of such application, at its election, either:
 
(i) afford such applicants access to the information preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with Section 6.01(a); or
 
(ii) inform such applicants as to the approximate number of Holders of Securities of such Series or all Securities, as the case may be, whose names and addresses appear in the information preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with Section 6.01(a), and as to the approximate cost of mailing to such Holders the form of proxy or other communication, if any, specified in such application.
 
If the Trustee shall elect not to afford such applicants access to such information, the Trustee shall, upon the written request of such applicants, mail to each Holder of a Security of such Series or all Holders of Securities, as the case may be, whose names and addresses appear in the information preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with Section 6.01(a), a copy of the form of proxy or other communication that is specified in such
 
request, with reasonable promptness after a tender to the Trustee of the material to be mailed and of payment, or provision for the payment, of the reasonable expenses of mailing, unless, within five days after such tender, the Trustee shall mail to such applicants and file with the Commission, together with a copy of the material to be mailed, a written statement to the effect that, in the opinion of the Trustee, such mailing would be contrary to the best interests of the Holders of Securities of such Series or all Securities, as the case may be, or would be in violation of applicable law. Such written statement shall specify the basis of such opinion. If the Commission, after opportunity for a hearing upon the objections specified in the written statement so filed, shall enter an order refusing to sustain any of such objections or if, after the entry of an order sustaining one or more of such objections, the Commission shall find, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that all the objections so sustained have been met and shall enter an order so declaring, the Trustee shall mail copies of such material to all such Holders of Securities with reasonable promptness after the entry of such order and the renewal of such tender; otherwise, the Trustee shall be relieved of any obligation or duty to such applicants respecting their application.
 
(c) Every Holder of Securities, by receiving and holding the same, agrees with the Company and the Trustee that none of the Company, the Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent or any Registrar shall be held accountable by reason of the disclosure of any information as to the names and addresses of the Holders of Securities in accordance with Section 6.01 or TIA 312, regardless of the source from which such information was derived, and that the Trustee shall not be held accountable by reason of mailing any material pursuant to a request made under this Section 6.01 or TIA 312(b).
 
(d) Holders may communicate pursuant to TIA 312(b) with other Holders with respect to their rights under this Indenture or the Securities of any Series issued hereunder. The Company, the Trustee, the Registrar and anyone else shall have the protection of TIA 312(c), and the Trustee shall comply with TIA 312(b) in connection with any such communication.
 
SECTION 6.02. Reports, Records and Filings by the Trustee.
 
(a) The Trustee shall, within 60 days after May 15 of each year commencing with the year 2003, mail to each Holder reports concerning the Trustee and its action under the Indenture as may be required pursuant to Section 313(a) of the TIA if and to the extent and in the manner provided pursuant thereto. The Trustee shall comply with TIA 313(b)(2) and shall transmit by mail all reports as required by TIA 313(c). The Trustee shall also comply with the other provisions of Section 313 of the TIA. Reports pursuant to this Section shall be transmitted by mail (1) to all Holders of Registered Securities, as their names and addresses appear in the Registry, and (2) except in the cases of reports under Section 313(b)(2) of the TIA, to each Holder of a Security of any Series whose name and address appear in the information preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with Section 6.01. A copy of each such report shall, at the time of such transmission to Holders, be filed by the Trustee with each securities exchange upon which any Securities are listed, and also with the Commission in accordance with TIA 313(d). The Company will notify the Trustee when any Securities are listed on any securities exchange.
 
(b) The Trustee or the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be responsible for (a) obtaining from Holders all Internal Revenue Service forms (and similar forms under applicable state, local, and foreign tax law) required under applicable U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign tax law in order to establish exemptions from or reductions in withholding taxes, (b) preparing, filing with the applicable taxing authority, and (to the extent required under applicable tax law) furnishing Holders with copies of, all tax reports or statements with respect to interest or principal payments on, or redemptions of, Securities which are required to be prepared, filed, and furnished under applicable U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign tax law, and (c) withholding and paying over to the applicable taxing authorities any tax withholdings that are required to be made under such applicable tax law.
 
(c) The Trustee or the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall maintain all appropriate records documenting compliance with such requirements until such time as all applicable periods of limitation for assessing or collecting any taxes or penalties for failure to comply fully with such requirements have expired, and shall make such records available, on written request, to the Company or its authorized representative within a reasonable period of time after receipt of such request.
 
The Company will:
SECTION 6.03. Reports by the Company.
 
(a) file with the Trustee, within 15 days after the Company is required to file the same with the Commission, copies of the annual reports and of the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the Commission may from time to time by rules and regulations prescribe) that the Company is then required to file with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange
 
Act; or, if the Company is not required to file information, documents or reports pursuant to either of those sections of the Exchange Act, then the Company will file with the Trustee and the Commission, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission, such of the supplementary and periodic information, documents and reports that may be required pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act in respect of a Security listed and registered on a national securities exchange as may be prescribed from time to time in such rules and regulations;

(c) transmit by mail to Holders of Securities, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 6.02(a), within 30 days after the filing thereof with the Trustee, such summaries of any information, documents and reports required to be filed by the Company or pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 6.03 as may be required by rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission.
 
 
 
"Event of Default," with respect to any Series of Securities, wherever used herein, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body), unless it is either inapplicable to a particular Series or it is specifically deleted or modified in the Supplemental Indenture, the Board Resolution or Officers' Certificate under which such Series of Securities is issued or in the form of Security for that Series:
SECTION 7.01. Events of Default.
 
(i) the Company fails to pay any interest upon any Security of that Series when it becomes due and payable, and such failure continues for a period of 30 days; or
 
(ii) the Company fails to pay the principal of, or premium, if any, on any Security of that Series at its Maturity; or
 
(iii) with respect to the Securities of that Series, the Company fails to perform, or a breach occurs as to any covenant or warranty it is obligated to perform or made by the Company in this Indenture with respect to the Securities of that Series (other than a covenant or warranty, a default in the performance of which or a breach of which is elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with or that has expressly been included in this Indenture by means of a Supplemental Indenture solely for the benefit of Series of Securities other than that Series), and continuance of such failure or breach for a period of 90 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that Series a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or
 
(iv) the entry of a decree or order by a court having jurisdiction in the premises granting relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, adjudging the Company, a bankrupt, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company, under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable Federal or State, or foreign, bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, or appointing a receiver, liquidator, custodian, assignee, trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Company or of substantially all of its properties, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; or
 
(v) the institution by the Company of proceedings to be adjudicated a bankrupt, or the consent of the Company to the institution of bankruptcy proceedings against it, or the filing by the
 
Company of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable Federal, State or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, or the consent by the Company to the filing of any such petition or to the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, custodian, assignee, trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Company or of substantially all of its properties; or
 
(vi) any other event or occurrence that is designated to be an Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that Series in the Supplemental Indenture, Board Resolution or Resolutions or Series Terms Certificate that establishes or evidences the terms of the Securities of that Series.
 
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 7.01(iv) or (v) with respect to the Company) with respect to any Series of Securities for which there are Securities Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then, and in every such case, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such Series may declare the principal of all the Securities of such Series (or, if the Securities of that Series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in, or determined in accordance with, the terms of that Series) to be immediately due and payable, by giving a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration, such amount, together with accrued interest thereof, shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 7.01(iv) or (v) occurs with respect to the Company and is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on all of the Outstanding Securities of all Series shall automatically become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.
SECTION 7.02. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
 
At any time after an acceleration with respect to Securities of any Series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such Series by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such acceleration and its consequences, and any Event of Default giving rise to such acceleration shall not be deemed to have occurred, if:
 
(i) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:
 
(A) all overdue installments of interest on all Securities of such Series,
 
(B) the principal of and premium, if any, of the Securities of such Series that have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor by the terms of the Securities of such Series,

(ii) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that Series, other than the nonpayment of the principal of Securities of that Series that have become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 7.13.
 
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
The Company covenants, that if:
SECTION 7.03. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
 
(i) default is made in the payment of any installment of interest on any Security of any Series when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or
 
(ii) default is made in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, on any Security of any Series at the Maturity thereof,
 
the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holder of any such Security of that Series, the whole amount then due and payable on any Security of that Series for principal, premium, if any, and
 
interest, with interest upon the overdue principal and premium, if any, and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be lawful, upon overdue installments of interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor by the terms of any Security of that Series; and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the reasonable costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 8.07.
 
If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities, wherever situated.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to any Series of Securities occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such Series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
 
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of any Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal, premium, if any, or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
SECTION 7.04. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
 
(i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal, (or, in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities, the portion of the stated principal of the Original Issue Discount Securities as may be provided in the terms thereof) premium, if any, and interest due and unpaid in respect of the Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 8.07) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding;
 
(ii) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and
 
(iii) unless prohibited by law or applicable regulations, to vote on behalf of the Holders of the Securities in any election of a trustee in bankruptcy or other person performing similar functions;
 
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 8.07.
 
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a Security any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of a Security in any such proceeding.
 
All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or under the Securities of any Series, may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities of such Series or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 8.07, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities of such Series in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
SECTION 7.05. Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities.
 
Any money collected by the Trustee with respect to a Series of Securities pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee, and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal, premium, if any, or interest, upon presentation of the Securities of that Series, and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 8.07 with respect to the Securities of that Series;
 
SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid upon the Securities of that Series for principal, premium, if any, and interest in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on Securities of that Series, for principal, premium, if any, and interest, respectively. The Holders of each Series of Securities denominated in any composite currency or a Foreign Currency shall be entitled to receive a ratable portion of the amount determined by the Exchange Rate Agent by converting the principal amount Outstanding of that Series of Securities and matured but unpaid interest on such Series of Securities in the currency in that Series of Securities denominated into Dollars at the Exchange Rate as of the Business Day immediately preceding the date of payment; and
 
THIRD: The balance, if any, to the Company.
 
No Holder of any Security of any Series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:
SECTION 7.07. Limitation on Suits.
 
(i) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to Securities of such Series;

(iii) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;
 
(iv) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
 
(v) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such Series;
 
it being understood and intended that no one or more Holders of Securities of such Series shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holders of Securities of such Series or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all the Holders of Securities of such Series.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right, that is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and, subject to Section 3.08, interest on such Security on the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security or, in the case of redemption or repurchase on the Redemption Date or Repurchase Date and to institute suit for the enforcement of such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
SECTION 7.08. Unconditional Right of Holders To Receive Principal, Premium and Interest.
 
If the Trustee or any Holder of a Security has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
SECTION 7.09. Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
 
Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, lost, destroyed or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section 3.07, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
SECTION 7.10. Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
 
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Security to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.
SECTION 7.11. Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
 
The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any Series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Securities of such Series; provided that:

(ii) the Trustee shall not determine that the action so directed would be unjustly prejudicial to the Holders not taking part in such direction;
 
(iii) subject to the provisions of Section 8.01, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee in good faith shall, by a Responsible Officer or Officers of the Trustee, determine that the proceeding so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability; and
 
(iv) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction.
 
The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any Series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such Series waive any past default hereunder and its consequences, except a default not theretofore cured:
SECTION 7.13. Waiver of Past Defaults.
 
(i) in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Security of such Series; or
 
(ii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such Series affected.
 
Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of the Securities of such Series under this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section 7.14 shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Company, to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any Series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder of Securities for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Security on or after the respective Stated Maturities expressed in that Security (or, in the case of redemption or repurchase, on or after the Redemption Date or Repurchase Date).
SECTION 7.14. Undertaking for Costs.
 
The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the
SECTION 7.15. Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.
 
benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, that may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture. The Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
 
 
 
(i) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default with respect to any Series of Securities:
SECTION 8.01. Certain Duties and Responsibilities.
 
(a) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture with respect to Securities of such Series, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee with respect to such Series; and
 
(b) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely with respect to the Securities of that Series, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificate or opinions that by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform as to form to the requirements of this Indenture.
 
(ii) In case an Event of Default with respect to any Series of Securities has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture with respect to such Series, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.
 
(iii) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
 
(a) this Section 8.01(iii) shall not be construed to limit the effect of Section 8.01(i);
 
(b) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error or judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;
 
(c) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any Series relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture with respect to Securities of such Series; and
 
(d) no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
 
(iv) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 8.01.
 
Within 90 days after the occurrence of any default hereunder with respect to Securities of any Series, the Trustee shall transmit by mail to all Holders of Securities of such Series entitled to receive reports pursuant to Section 6.02(a) notice of such default hereunder known to the Trustee, unless
SECTION 8.02. Notice of Default.
 
such default shall have been cured or waived; provided, however, that, except in the case of a default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Security of such Series, or in the payment of any sinking fund installment with respect to Securities of such Series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee or a trust committee of directors and/or Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Holders of Securities of such Series. For the purpose of this Section 8.02, the term "default," with respect to Securities of any Series, means any event that is, or after notice or lapse of time, or both, would become, an Event of Default with respect to Securities of such Series.
 
Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.01:
SECTION 8.03. Certain Rights of Trustee.
 
(i) the Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, Security or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;
 
(ii) any request or direction of the Board of Directors referred to herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Company Request or Company Order, and any resolution of the Board of Directors may be sufficiently evidenced by a Board Resolution;
 
(iii) whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Trustee (unless other evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its part, rely upon an Officers' Certificate;
 
(iv) the Trustee may consult with counsel and the advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;
 
(v) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities that might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction;
 
(vi) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, security or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney and, if so requested to do so by any of the Holders, at the sole cost and expense of the Holders;
 
(vii) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys, and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder;
 
(viii) the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any default (as defined in Section 8.02) or Event of Default unless either (1) a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have actual knowledge of such default or Event of Default or (2) written notice of such default or Event of Default shall have been given to the Trustee by the Company or any Holder;
 
(ix) the Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith and reasonably believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture; and
 
(x) in the event that the Trustee is also acting as Paying Agent, Authenticating Agent or Registrar hereunder, the rights and protections afforded to the Trustee pursuant to this Article Eight shall also be afforded to such Paying Agent, Authenticating Agent or Registrar.
 
The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the
SECTION 8.04. Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities.
 
Company, and neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent assumes responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities. The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Company of Securities or the proceeds thereof.
 
The Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent, the Registrar or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and, subject to Sections 8.08 and 8.13, may otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Registrar or such other agent.
SECTION 8.05. May Hold Securities.
 
Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise agreed in writing with the Company.
SECTION 8.06. Money Held in Trust.
 
The Company agrees:
SECTION 8.07. Compensation and Reimbursement.
 
(i) to pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for all services rendered to the Company by the Trustee hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust);
 
(ii) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture and relating to Securities issued by the Company (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to the Trustee's negligence or bad faith; and
 
(iii) to indemnify the Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on the Trustee's part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of this trust in connection with the Securities of the Company, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder.
 
As security for the performance of the obligations of the Company under this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities upon all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee in connection with the Securities of the Company as such, except funds held in trust for the payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on particular Securities.
 
Without prejudice to any other rights available to the Trustee under applicable law, when the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with an Event of Default specified in Section 7.01(iv) or (v) as to the Securities of a Series, the expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration in connection with the Securities of the Company under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law.
 
The obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 8.07 and any lien arising hereunder shall survive the resignation or removal of any Trustee, the discharge of the Company's obligations pursuant to Article Eleven of this Indenture and the termination of this Indenture and the repayment of the Securities whether at the Stated Maturity or otherwise.
 
If the Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of Section 310(b) of the TIA, the Trustee shall either eliminate such conflicting interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the TIA and this Indenture. To the extent permitted by the TIA, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have a conflicting interest with respect to the Securities of any Series by virtue of being Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular Series of Securities other than that Series.
SECTION 8.08. Disqualification; Conflicting Interests.
 
There shall at all times be a Trustee with respect to each Series of Securities hereunder that shall be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000, subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority; provided, however, that if Section 310(a) of the TIA or the rules and regulations of the Commission under the TIA at any time permit a corporation organized and doing
SECTION 8.09. Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility.
 
business under the laws of any other jurisdiction to serve as trustee of an indenture qualified under the TIA, this Section 8.09 shall be automatically deemed amended to permit a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of any such jurisdiction to serve as Trustee hereunder. If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section 8.09, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. Neither the Company nor any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Company may serve as Trustee. If at any time the Trustee with respect to any Series of Securities shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.09, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article Eight. The Trustee is subject to TIA 310(b), including the optional provision permitted by the second sentence of TIA 310(b)(9). The Trustee and any successor Trustee shall always satisfy the requirements of TIA 310(a)(1), (2) and (5).
 
SECTION 8.10. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor Trustee.
 
(i) No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee under Section 8.11.
 
(ii) The Trustee may resign with respect to any Series of Securities at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If an instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee shall not have been delivered to the resigning Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to Securities of such Series.
 
(iii) The Trustee may be removed with respect to any Series of Securities at any time by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such Series, delivered to the Trustee and to the Company.
 
(iv) If at any time:
 
(a) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 8.08 with respect to any Series of Securities after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such Series for at least six months; or
 
(b) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 8.09 with respect to any Series of Securities and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder of Securities of such Series; or
 
(c) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting with respect to any Series of Securities or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation;
 
then, in any such case, (1) the Company by a Board Resolution may remove the Trustee with respect to such Series, or (2) subject to Section 7.14, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such Series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to such Series.
 
(v) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting with respect to any Series of Securities, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of the Trustee with respect to any Series of Securities for any cause, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those Series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such Series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular Series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11. If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to such Series of Securities shall be appointed by the Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such Series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee with respect to such Series, the
 
successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment, become the successor Trustee with respect to such Series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company with respect to such Series. If no successor Trustee with respect to such Series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders of Securities of such Series and accepted appointment in the manner hereinafter provided, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such Series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to such Series.
 
(vi) The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any Series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any Series by mailing written notice of that event by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders of Registered Securities of that Series as their names and addresses appear in the Registry. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such Series and the address of its Principal Corporate Trust Office.
 
(i) In the case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to any Series of Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective with respect to all or any Series as to that it is resigning as Trustee, and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to all or any such Series; but, on request of the Company or such successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of such retiring Trustee with respect to all or any such Series; and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to all or any such Series, subject nevertheless to its lien, if any, provided for in Section 8.07.
SECTION 8.11. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor Trustee.
 
(ii) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) Series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those Series shall execute and deliver a Supplemental Indenture wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and that (a) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those Series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (b) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Series of Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those Series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (c) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such Supplemental Indenture shall constitute such Trustee's co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such Supplemental Indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those Series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those Series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, subject nevertheless to its lien, if any, provided for in Section 8.07.
 
(iii) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (i) or (ii) of this Section, as the case may be.
 
(iv) No successor Trustee with respect to a Series of Securities shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible with respect to such Series under this Article.
 
Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder; provided that such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities.
SECTION 8.12. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business of Trustee.
 
The Trustee is and shall be subject to the provisions of TIA 311(a). There shall be excluded from the operation of TIA 311(a) for all purposes, each creditor relationship described or listed in TIA 311(b). A Trustee that has resigned or been removed shall be subject to and shall comply with TIA 311(a) to the extent required thereby.
SECTION 8.13. Preferential Collection of Claims Against the Company.
 
The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents, that may include any Affiliate of the Company, with respect to one or more Series of Securities. Such Authenticating Agent or Agents shall, at the option of the Trustee, be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such Series issued upon original issuance, exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 3.07, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Whenever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication or the delivery of Securities to the Trustee for authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent, a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and delivery of Securities to the Authenticating Agent on behalf of the Trustee. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Authenticating Agent located outside the United States may be appointed by the Trustee if previously approved in writing by the Company and if such Authenticating Agent meets the minimum capitalization requirements of this Section 8.14. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
SECTION 8.14. Appointment of Authenticating Agents.
 
Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent; provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
 
An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time (and upon request by the Company shall) terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent that shall be acceptable to the Company. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
 
If an appointment with respect to one or more Series is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such Series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication substantially in the following form:
 
This is one of the Securities of the Series designated herein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
 
 
Without the consent of any Holder of any Securities, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, may enter into one or more Supplemental Indentures, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, for any of the following purposes:
SECTION 9.01. Supplemental Indentures Without Consent of Holders.
 
(i) to evidence the succession of another corporation or Person to the Company, and the assumption by any such successor of the covenants of the Company herein and in the Securities contained; or
 
(ii) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by another corporation as a successor Trustee hereunder with respect to one or more Series of Securities and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, pursuant to Section 8.11; or
 
(iii) to add to the covenants of the Company, for the benefit of the Holders of Securities of all or any Series of Securities (and if such covenants are to be for the benefit of less than all Series of Securities, stating that such covenants are expressly being included solely for the benefit of that Series or those Series specified in such Supplemental Indenture), or to surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the Company; or
 
(iv) to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision herein that may be inconsistent with any other provision herein, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the Indenture; provided that such action shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities of any Series; or
 
(v) to add any additional Events of Default with respect to all or any Series of the Securities (and, if such Event of Default is applicable to less than all Series of Securities, specifying the Series to which such Event of Default is applicable); or
 
(vi) to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture; provided that any such addition, change or elimination (a) shall become effective only when there is no Security Outstanding of any Series created prior to the execution of such Supplemental Indenture that is adversely affected by such change in or elimination of such provision or (b) shall not apply to any Securities Outstanding; or
 
(vii) to establish the form or terms of Securities of any Series as permitted by Sections 2.02 and 3.01; or
 
(viii) to evidence any changes to Section 8.09 as permitted by the terms thereof; or
 
(ix) to comply with requirements of the Commission in order to effect or maintain the qualification of this Indenture under the TIA; or
 
(x) to add to or change or eliminate any provision of this Indenture as shall be necessary or desirable in accordance with any amendments to the TIA; provided such action shall not adversely affect the interest of Holders of Securities of any Series.
 
(a) With the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all Series affected by such Supplemental Indenture or Indentures (acting as one class), by Act of said Holders delivered to the Company and the Trustee, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution and the Trustee may enter into an Indenture or Supplemental Indenture for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of Securities of each such Series under this Indenture; provided, however, that no such Supplemental Indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby:
SECTION 9.02. Supplemental Indentures With Consent of Holders.
 
(i) change the Maturity of the principal of, or the Stated Maturity of any installment of interest (or premium, if any) on, any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or any premium thereon or the rate of interest thereon or change the method or methods for determining the rate of interest thereon or change the obligation of the Company to pay additional amounts pursuant to Section 5.04 (except as contemplated by Section 10.01(i) and permitted by Section 9.01), or reduce the amount of the principal of an Original Issue Discount Security that would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 7.02 or a repurchase or redemption of any Securities affected, or change the method of calculating interest thereon or the coin or currency in which any Security, premium, if any, thereon, or the interest thereon is payable, or reduce the minimum rate of interest thereon, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption or repurchase on or after the Redemption Date or Repurchase Date);
 
(ii) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any Series, the consent of whose Holders is required for any such Supplemental Indenture or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver of certain defaults hereunder and their consequences as provided for in this Indenture or reduce the requirements of Section 14.04 for a quorum;
 
(iii) change any obligation of the Company to maintain an office or agency in the places and for the purposes specified in Section 5.02; or
 
(iv) modify any of the provisions of this Section 9.02 or Section 7.13, except to increase any such percentage or to provide that certain other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived.
 
(b) It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed Supplemental Indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof.
 
(c) A Supplemental Indenture that changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture that has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular Series of Securities, or that modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such Series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other Series.
 
In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any Supplemental Indenture permitted by this Article Nine or the modifications thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 8.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such Supplemental Indenture is authorized or permitted by and complies with this Indenture. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such Supplemental Indenture that affects the Trustee's own rights, liabilities, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
SECTION 9.03. Execution of Supplemental Indentures.
 
Upon the execution of any Supplemental Indenture under this Article Nine, this Indenture shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such Supplemental Indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and every Holder of Securities theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder shall be bound thereby.
SECTION 9.04. Effect of Supplemental Indentures.
 
Every Supplemental Indenture executed pursuant to this Article Nine shall conform to the requirements of the TIA as then in effect.
SECTION 9.05. Conformity with Trust Indenture Act.

If the Company shall so determine, new Securities so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Company, to any such Supplemental Indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities.
SECTION 9.06. Reference in Securities to Supplemental Indentures.
 
 
 
So long as any Security remains Outstanding, the Company shall not amalgamate or consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or convey or transfer its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person or enter into any reorganization or arrangement, unless:
SECTION 10.01. Company May Consolidate Only on Certain Terms.
 
(i) the Company shall be the surviving or continuing entity or the Person formed by such amalgamation, consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the Person that acquires by conveyance or transfer the properties and assets of the Company substantially as an entirety is an entity organized under the laws of a state of the United States of America, and the Company has delivered to the Trustee (x) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such amalgamation, consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer transaction involving the Company, and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such transaction had not been effected, which Opinion of Counsel shall be based upon (and accompanied by a copy of) a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service to the same effect unless there has been a change in applicable Federal income tax law after the Closing Date such that a ruling is no longer required or (y) a ruling directed to the Trustee received from the Internal Revenue Service to the same effect as the aforementioned Opinion of Counsel;
 
(ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Event of Default, and no event that, after notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default, shall have happened and be continuing; and
 
(iii) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that such amalgamation, consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer and such Supplemental Indenture comply with this Article Ten and that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to such transaction have been complied with.
 
Upon any amalgamation, consolidation, merger, reorganization or arrangement or any conveyance or transfer of the properties and assets of the Company substantially as an entirety in accordance with Section 10.01, the successor Person formed by such amalgamation or consolidation or into which the Company is merged or to which such conveyance or transfer is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company, as the case may be, under this Indenture with the same effect as if such successor Person had been named as the Company herein. In the event of any such conveyance or transfer, the Company, as the predecessor corporation, shall be relieved of all obligations and covenants under this Indenture and the Securities, and may be dissolved, wound up and liquidated at any time thereafter. Such successor Person thereupon may cause to be signed, and may issue either in its own name or in the name of the Company, any or all of Securities of any Series issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee. All Securities so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as Securities theretofore or thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Securities had been issued, or annexed, or endorsed at the date of the execution hereof.
SECTION 10.02. Successor Corporation Substituted.
 
 
 
The Company may, at the option of the Board of Directors evidenced by a resolution set forth in an Officers' Certificate, at any time, elect to have either Section 11.02 or 11.03 be applied to all outstanding Securities of all Series or any Series upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article Eleven.
SECTION 11.01. Option to Effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
 
Upon the Company's exercise under Section 11.01 of the option applicable to this Section 11.02 as to the outstanding Securities of all Series or any Series, the Company, as applicable, shall, subject to the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 11.04, be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to all outstanding Securities as to which the option provided in Section 11.01 is exercised, on the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "Legal Defeasance"). For this purpose, Legal Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such outstanding Securities, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 11.05, Section 11.09 and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to below, and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following provisions which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (a) the rights of Holders of outstanding Securities to receive solely from the trust fund described in Section 11.04, and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any, on such Securities when such payments are due, (b) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under Article Three and Section 5.02, (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and the Company's obligations in connection therewith and (d) this Article Eleven. Subject to compliance with this Article Eleven, the Company may exercise its option under this Section 11.02 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 11.03.
SECTION 11.02. Legal Defeasance and Discharge.
 
Upon the Company's exercise under Section 11.01 of the option applicable to this Section 11.03 as to the outstanding Securities of all Series or any Series, subject to the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 11.04, the Company shall be released from its respective obligations under Section 5.06 and any covenants which are made a part of the terms of the Securities of a Series in accordance with clause (xx) of the fifth paragraph of Section 3.01 (unless such a covenant is expressly excluded from the release contemplated by this Section 11.03), in each case on and after the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied as to those Securities as to which that option is exercised (hereinafter, "Covenant Defeasance"), and such Securities shall thereafter be deemed not "outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed "outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Securities shall not be deemed outstanding for accounting purposes). For this purpose, Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Securities of any Series as to which the Covenant Defeasance has occurred, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute or give rise to a default or an Event of Default under Section 7.01(iii), but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby. In addition, upon the Company's exercise under Section 11.01 of the option applicable to this Section 11.03, subject to the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 11.04, Section 7.01(iii) shall not constitute Events of Default.
SECTION 11.03. Covenant Defeasance.
 
The following shall be the conditions to the application of either Section 11.02 or 11.03 to the outstanding Securities of a Series:
SECTION 11.04. Conditions to Legal or Covenant Defeasance.
 
In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:
 
(1) the Company must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities as to which Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will occur, moneys (which shall be United States legal tender except to the extent necessary to provide for the payment of any
 
Series of Securities that is denominated in a currency other than Dollars, in which case such moneys shall include such other currency) and Government Securities (or to the extent that a Series of Securities is denominated in a currency other than Dollars, equivalent securities issued by a government, governmental agency or central bank of a country in whose currency the Series of Securities is denominated that are backed by the full faith and credit of the government of that country) or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, interest on such Securities on the Stated Maturity for payment thereof or on the redemption date of such principal or installment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on such Securities (and the Company must specify whether the Securities are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date), and the Holders of such Securities must have a valid, perfected, exclusive security interest in such trust;
 
(2) in the case of an election under Section 11.02, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United States reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that (A) the Company has received from, or there has been published by the Internal Revenue Service, a ruling or (B) since the date of this Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders of such Securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;
 
(3) in the case of an election under Section 11.03, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United States reasonably acceptable to such Trustee confirming that the Holders of such Securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;
 
(4) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit);
 
(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under this Indenture or any other material agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound;
 
(6) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United States reasonably acceptable to such Trustee confirming that, after the 91st day following such deposit, the deposited funds will not be part of any "estate" formed by the bankruptcy of the Company or subject to the "automatic stay" under the Bankruptcy Code or, in the case of Covenant Defeasance, will be subject to a first priority Lien in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders;
 
(7) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of preferring the Holders of such Securities over any other creditors of the Company or with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any other creditors of the Company, or others; and
 
(8) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that the conditions precedent provided for in such documents have been complied with.
 
If the funds deposited with the Trustee to effect Covenant Defeasance are insufficient to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities when due, then the obligations of the Company under this Indenture will be revived, no such defeasance shall be deemed to have occurred and, at the request of the Company, the Trustee will return to the Company the funds deposited by the Company to effect the Covenant Defeasance.
 
Subject to Section 11.06, all moneys and Government Securities (and any foreign government securities) (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 11.05, the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 11.04 in respect of outstanding Securities shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal, premium, if any, and interest (and Additional Interest, if any), but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
SECTION 11.05. Deposited Money and Government Securities to be Held in Trust; Other Miscellaneous Provisions.
 
The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the cash or Government Securities deposited pursuant to Section 11.04 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof, other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the outstanding Securities.
 
Anything in this Article Eleven to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon the request of the Company any money or Government Securities held by it as provided in Section 11.04 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee (which may be the opinion delivered under Section 11.04), are in excess of the amount thereof that would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
 
Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Security and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, and premium, if any, or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on its written request or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as a creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; , that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in the New York Times and The Wall Street Journal (national edition), notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such notification or publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.
SECTION 11.06. Repayment to the Company.
provided, however
 
If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any moneys, Government Securities or other securities that have been deposited pursuant to Section 11.04 in accordance with Section 11.02 or 11.03, as the case may be, by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Securities as to which the option under Section 11.01 is exercised shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 11.04, until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such moneys, Government Securities or other securities in accordance with Section 11.02 or 11.03, as the case may be; , that, if the Company makes any payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Security following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the moneys, Government Securities or other securities held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.
SECTION 11.07. Reinstatement.
provided, however
 
This Indenture shall cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities as provided in Sections 3.06 and 3.07 and in the Securities, all rights to receive payments thereof or thereon as provided in Sections 3.08 and 5.01 and otherwise in this Indenture and in the Securities and any right to receive additional amounts as provided in Section 5.04), and the Trustee, on receipt of a Company Request and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to the Company, when:
SECTION 11.08. Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.
 
(i) either
 
(a) all Securities theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (1) Securities that have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 3.07, and (2) Securities for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 5.03) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
 
(b) all such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation
 
(1) have become due and payable, or

Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 8.07 and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to clause (i)(b) of this Section 11.08, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 11.02 and the last paragraph of Section 5.03 shall survive.
 
Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 5.03, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 11.01 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent), as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal, premium, if any, and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee; but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.

SECTION 14.05. Determination of Voting Rights; Conduct and Adjournment of Meetings.
 
(i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture, the Trustee may make such reasonable regulations as it may deem advisable for any meeting of Holders of Securities of such Series in regard to proof of the holding of Securities of such Series and of the appointment of proxies and in regard to the appointment and duties of inspectors of votes, the submission and examination of proxies, certificates and other evidence of the right to vote, and such other matters concerning the conduct of the meeting as it
 
shall deem appropriate. Except as otherwise permitted or required by any such regulations, the holding of Securities shall be proved in the manner specified in Section 1.04, and the appointment of any proxy shall be proved in the manner specified in Section 1.04. Such regulations may provide that written instruments appointing proxies, regular on their face, may be presumed valid and genuine without the proof specified in Section 1.04 or other proof.
 
(ii) The Trustee shall, by an instrument in writing, appoint a temporary chairperson of the meeting, unless the meeting shall have been called by the Company or by Holders of Securities as provided in Section 14.02(b), in which case the Company or the Holders of Securities of the Series calling the meeting, as the case may be, shall in like manner appoint a temporary chairperson. A permanent chairperson and a permanent secretary of the meeting shall be elected by vote of the Persons entitled to vote a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such Series represented at the meeting.
 
(iii) At any meeting, each Holder of a Security of such Series or proxy shall be entitled to one vote for each $1,000 principal amount (or the equivalent in any Foreign Currency) of Securities of such Series held or represented by him; provided, however, that no vote shall be cast or counted at any meeting in respect of any Security challenged as not Outstanding and ruled by the chairperson of the meeting not to be Outstanding. The chairperson of the meeting shall have no right to vote, except as a Holder of a Security of such Series or a proxy.
 
(iv) Any meeting of Holders of Securities of any Series duly called pursuant to Section 14.02 at which a quorum is present may be adjourned from time to time by Persons entitled to vote a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such Series represented at the meeting; and the meeting may be held as so adjourned without further notice.
 
The vote upon any resolution submitted to any meeting of Holders of Securities of any Series shall be by written ballots on which shall be subscribed the signatures of the Holders of Securities of such Series or of their representatives by proxy and the principal amounts and serial numbers of the Outstanding Securities of such Series held or represented by them.

Based on the foregoing and subject to the qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that, upon the execution and delivery of the Notes and their authentication in accordance with the terms of the Indenture against payment therefor in accordance with the Agreement, the Notes will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
 
The foregoing opinion is qualified to the extent that the enforceability of the Indenture, the Notes or any related document or instrument may be limited by or subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization, liquidation, rearrangement, probate, conservatorship, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or other similar laws (including court decisions) now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally or providing for the relief of debtors, general principles of equity (regardless of whether such remedies are sought in a proceeding in equity or at law) or public policy and (ii) the refusal of a particular court to grant (a) equitable remedies, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, specific performance and injunctive relief, or (b) a particular remedy sought under the Indenture with respect to the Notes or under the Notes as opposed to another remedy provided for therein or another remedy available at law or in equity. We note that the enforceability of specific provisions of the Indenture and the Notes may be subject to (i) standards of reasonableness and "good faith" limitations and obligations such as those provided in the New York Uniform Commercial Code and similar applicable principles of common law and judicial decisions and (ii) the course of dealings between the parties, the usage of trade and similar provisions of common law and judicial decision.
 
We express no opinion concerning (i) the validity or enforceability of (a) severability clauses or (b) any provision contained in the Indenture or the Notes that purports to waive or not give effect to rights to notice, defenses, subrogation or other rights or benefits that cannot be effectively waived under applicable law, (ii) the enforceability of indemnification provisions to the extent they purport to relate to liabilities resulting from or based on negligence or any violation of any federal or state securities laws or (iii) the enforceability of any provision in the Indenture or the Notes that purports to waive liability for violation of securities laws. With respect to Section 8.07(i) of the Indenture, we express no opinion with respect to the enforceability of the parenthetical clause thereof relating to the limitations on the compensation of trustees.
 
The foregoing opinions are limited in all respects to the federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of New York. We do not express any opinion as to the laws of any other jurisdiction.
