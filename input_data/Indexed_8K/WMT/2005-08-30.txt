Notes and of the Series of the Notes of which that Note is a part will not have been modified or rescinded, and there will not have occurred any change in law affecting the validity or enforceability of the Notes and (ix) the Global Notes executed and delivered by the Company as contemplated herein will be identical in form to the forms of the Global Notes examined by us as described herein.
 
As to facts material to our opinion, we have made no independent investigation of such facts and have relied, to the extent that we deem such reliance proper, upon certificates of public officials and officers or other representatives of the Company.
 
Based on the foregoing and subject to the qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that, upon the execution and delivery of the Notes and their authentication in accordance with the terms of the Indenture against payment therefor in accordance with the Agreement, the Notes will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
 
The foregoing opinion is qualified to the extent that the enforceability of the Indenture, the Notes or any related document or instrument may be limited by or subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization, liquidation, rearrangement, probate, conservatorship, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or other similar laws (including court decisions) now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally or providing for the relief of debtors, general principles of equity (regardless of whether such remedies are sought in a proceeding in equity or at law) or public policy and (ii) the refusal of a particular court to grant (a) equitable remedies, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, specific performance and injunctive relief, or (b) a particular remedy sought under the Indenture with respect to the Notes or under the Notes as opposed to another remedy provided for therein or another remedy available at law or in equity. We note that the enforceability of specific provisions of the Indenture and the Notes may be subject to (i) standards of reasonableness and "good faith" limitations and obligations such as those provided in the New York Uniform Commercial Code and similar applicable principles of common law and judicial decisions and (ii) the course of dealings between the parties, the usage of trade and similar provisions of common law and judicial decision.
 
We express no opinion concerning (i) the validity or enforceability of (a) the severability clauses in Section 1.11 of the Indenture and Section 16 of the Notes or (b) any provision contained in the Indenture or the Notes that purports to waive or not give effect to rights to notice, defenses, subrogation or other rights or benefits that cannot be effectively waived under applicable law, (ii) the enforceability of indemnification provisions to the extent they purport to relate to liabilities resulting from or based on negligence or any violation of any federal or state securities laws or (iii) the enforceability of any provision in the Indenture or the Notes that

purports to waive liability for violation of securities laws. With respect to Section 8.07(i) of the Indenture, we express no opinion with respect to the enforceability of the parenthetical clause thereof relating to the limitations on the compensation of trustees.
 
The foregoing opinions are limited in all respects to the federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of New York. We do not express any opinion as to the laws of any other jurisdiction.
