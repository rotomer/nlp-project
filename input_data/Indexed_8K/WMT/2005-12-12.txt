Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 12, 2005, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (the "Company"), pursuant to the approval of the Compensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, offered alternative amendments (the "Amendments") to the Company's form of Post-Termination Agreement and Covenant Not to Compete Agreements (the "Non-Compete Agreements") to the Company's officers who have entered into Non-Compete Agreements. The Amendments are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which was enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and established certain requirements for deferred compensation agreements. The Company's officers, including the named executive officers, who have entered into a Non-Compete Agreement and wish to modify their Non-Compete Agreement with the Company will be able to consent to one of two Amendments. Pursuant to one of the Amendments, the first six-month's of severance payments will be paid in a lump sum at the end of the six months after the officer's severance from the Company. Pursuant to the other Amendment, the first six-month's of severance payments will be paid in a lump sum immediately after the officer's severance from the Company.
Copies of Amendments are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 to this Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
