Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. is furnishing the following information:
 
Beginning with the monthly sales release for February 2006, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. is revising its method for determining the stores and clubs that are included in our publicly released comparative store sales calculations for our Wal-Mart Stores and SAM'S CLUB segments and for our total operations in the United States. Comparative store sales is a measure that indicates the performance of our existing stores by measuring the growth in sales for such stores for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year.
 
Prior to February 2006, stores and clubs were not included in comparative store sales until the beginning of the fiscal year (February 1) following their one-year grand opening anniversary. Likewise, stores and clubs that were relocated or expanded were excluded from comparative store sales until the beginning of the fiscal year (February 1) following the one-year anniversary of the relocation or expansion.
 
Beginning in February 2006, we will include in our measure of comparative store sales all stores and clubs that have been open for at least the previous twelve months. Additionally, stores and clubs that are relocated or expanded will be excluded from comparative store sales for the first twelve months following the relocation or expansion. These revisions are being made to better conform our calculation of comparative store sales to retail industry practice.
 
Also beginning in February 2006, our measure of comparative store sales disclosed in sales and earnings releases will exclude the impact of fuel sales at our SAM'S CLUB segment. We believe this method of calculating comparative store sales is more meaningful to investors because it excludes the impact of fuel price volatility.
 
The table being furnished and included herewith as Exhibit 99.1 presents monthly comparative store sales figures for fiscal 2006 calculated in the same manner as comparative store sales will be calculated beginning in February 2006. The table also details the impact of fuel sales on comparative store sales for SAM'S CLUB and our total operations in the United States. This table will be made available on the investor relations section of our website, The figures in the following table will appear in our fiscal 2007 sales releases as comparative store sales for fiscal 2006.

Comparative store sales is also referred to as "same-store" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparative store sales may vary across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparative store sales (including the manner in which we treat fuel sales, relocations and expansions), is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
