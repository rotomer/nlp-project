Item 8.01. Other Events.
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (the "Company") periodically communicates with its shareholders and other members of the investment community (collectively referred to as the "Investment Community") about our operations (the "Periodic Communications"). We do so through press releases, telecommunications and web casts. Our policy regarding Periodic Communications is described in a Current Report on Form 8-K that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 16, 2005 (the "August 2005 8-K").
Effective February 5, 2007, we will modify our policy regarding Periodic Communications with respect to the Company's sales and, thereafter, will no longer provide an estimate of the Company's sales for each retail sales period on the Saturday next following the end of that retail sales period. Otherwise, our policy regarding Periodic Communications as described in the August 2005 8-K (including our policy regarding disclosure of our sales for each retail sales period and our fiscal year to date by means of a press release issued on the Thursday following each retail sales period in accordance with the reporting schedule listed in the investor relations section of our website at www.walmartstores.com) will remain unchanged.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Dated: February 2, 2007
