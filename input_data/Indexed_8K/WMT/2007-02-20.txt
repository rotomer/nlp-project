Exhibit 99.1
 
BENTONVILLE, Ark., Feb. 20, 2007  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) today reported record sales and earnings for the quarter ended Jan. 31, 2007. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $98.090 billion, an increase of 10.9 percent over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006. Income from continuing operations for the quarter was $3.940 billion, an increase of 8.8 percent from $3.621 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006.
Earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.95, up from $0.87 per share in the same prior year quarter. Fourth quarter earnings in fiscal 2007 were favorably impacted by a $98 million net tax benefit recorded in the Company's tax provision. This $0.02 per share net benefit arose primarily from the resolution of certain tax matters related to transfer pricing and the renewal of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit.
Net sales for the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2007, were $344.992 billion, an increase of 11.7 percent over fiscal year 2006. Income from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2007, increased 6.7 percent to $12.178 billion, up from $11.408 billion in the prior year. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2007, were $2.92, up from $2.72 in the prior year.
The dispositions of the Company's operations in South Korea and Germany, completed during the third quarter of fiscal year 2007, continue to be accounted for as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.
"We are extremely pleased to close fiscal year 2007 with both record sales and earnings," said Lee Scott, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. president and chief executive officer. "The Wal-Mart associates around the world stepped up and delivered a wonderful fourth quarter and I am encouraged by their achievements as we head into the current fiscal year. Our Company's performance for the fiscal year was helped by a strong fourth quarter. Even if you take into account the discontinued operations, we still had record results."
Scott said that Wal-Mart customers around the world benefited from low prices.
 
 
"It's a reaffirmation of the proposition that's synonymous with Wal-Mart  saving people money so they can live better," said Scott. "Sam Walton started our Company in 1962 with this simple principle. And this is the mission that drives our strategy around the world today."
Net sales were as follows (dollars in billions):
