On January 22, 2005, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a Retirement Agreement (the "Retirement Agreement") with Thomas M. Coughlin, who was then Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company. The Company disclosed the terms of the Retirement Agreement on a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on January 26, 2005.
On June 10, 2005, the Company gave written notice to Mr. Coughlin that the Company had rescinded the Retirement Agreement in its entirety and had revoked certain retirement and other benefits. The basis for the rescission and the revocation of the Retirement Agreement and other benefits was disclosed in a Form 8-K filed with the Commission on June 10, 2005.
