Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On September 23, 2011, the Board of Directors of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (the "Company") adopted the Walmart Deferred Compensation Matching Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan is intended to replace the Company's existing Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "SERP") and Officer Deferred Compensation Plan (the "ODCP"). In conjunction with the adoption of the Plan, the Board adopted amendments to the SERP and ODCP, as described below.
The Plan, which will become effective on February 1, 2012, is designed to be more compatible with the Walmart 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan"), which currently provides for a Company matching contribution of up to 6% of eligible pay, up to certain limits under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and regulations thereunder. The Plan is also intended to be simpler and more similar to plans offered by many other retailers and large public companies. The Plan is intended to provide comparable value to participating Company associates as the current SERP and ODCP, and is not expected to result in increased cost to the Company.
Under the Plan, Company officers will be eligible to participate in the Plan and may elect to defer any or all of their salary, any amount payable to them under the Company's Management Incentive Plan (the "MIP"), and any special bonuses they may be awarded in a Plan year. Certain other employees of the Company having base compensation in excess of the limitation set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Code will be eligible to participate in the Plan and defer up to 80 percent of any amounts payable to them under the MIP in a Plan year. The amount a participant elects to defer in any Plan year will be credited to a bookkeeping account to be maintained in the name of that participant under the Plan. Participants in the Plan will be fully vested immediately on their own contributions.
The Company will allocate to a participant's Plan account a matching contribution equal to the amounts deferred by a participant in a Plan year, up to 6% of the amount by which the total of the participant's base salary and any amount payable to the participant under the MIP for the Plan year (whether or not deferred) exceeds the then applicable limitation in Section 401(a)(17) of the Code. Participants in the Plan will be required to be employed on the last day of a Plan year to receive a matching contribution for that Plan year. A participant in the Plan will become vested in the Company's matching contributions credited to his or her account once the participant has participated in the Plan for three years after his or her initial deferral of compensation under the Plan. For purposes of determining the vesting of Company matching contributions under the Plan, Plan participants who were participants in the ODCP will be given participation credit for their years of participation in the ODCP.
In addition, Plan participants' accounts will be credited daily with the equivalent of a daily rate of interest based on the yield on United Stated Treasury securities (not indexed for inflation) with a constant maturity of 10 years plus 2.7 percent, which is the same interest rate currently credited under the ODCP. A participant determined to have engaged in conduct detrimental to the best interests of the Company will forfeit all matching contributions and any earnings on the matching contributions credited to his or her Plan account and the earnings on the amounts of deferred compensation credited to the participant's account will be recalculated based on a rate that is 50% of the rate at which those earnings would otherwise be calculated.
Amounts deferred by a participant under the Plan and allocations of matching contributions and earnings to a participant's Plan account will generally not be subject to income tax, and the Company will not receive a deduction for the amounts deferred or allocated to a participant's account until those amounts are distributed pursuant to the Plan.
The Company will distribute to a participant the amounts credited to the participant's Plan account, including any vested matching contributions and allocated earnings on the account, at a time or times elected by the participant and otherwise upon the participant's retirement from the Company, separation from service with the Company or death. A participant will receive the distribution in a lump sum, although a participant may elect to receive the distribution of the amount credited to his or her Plan account upon his or her retirement from the Company in up to 15 equal annual installments. The obligations of the Company to make distributions under the Plan will be general, unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally with the other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company.
 
The Plan will be administered by the Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. The Company can amend or terminate the Plan at any time, but no such action may cause a participant to forfeit his or her Plan account.
In conjunction with the adoption of the Plan, the ODCP and SERP were amended, effective January 31, 2012, so that no new participant contributions or deferrals may be made under the ODCP or SERP after January 31, 2012. Company allocations to participants' accounts in the SERP and ODCP will continue to be made in accordance with the terms of the SERP and the ODCP. In addition, the SERP was amended so that participants' accounts will be credited daily with the same interest rate that will be credited under the Plan. Under the existing terms of the SERP, participants' accounts are credited with amounts intended to track the participants' rate of return under the 401(k) Plan.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Dated: September 29, 2011
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
 
 
The purpose of the Walmart Deferred Compensation Matching Plan is to enable certain individuals to defer compensation and to be credited with matching allocations and earnings. The Plan is intended to reward such individuals for their contributions to the success of Walmart and its Related Affiliates. The Plan is also intended to assist such individuals in saving for retirement by providing benefits that are in excess of benefits permitted by applicable law under the 401(k) Plan.
 
The effective date of the Plan is February 1, 2012.
 
The Plan is intended to be (and shall be administered as) an unfunded employee pension plan benefiting a select group of management or highly compensated employees under the provisions of ERISA. The Plan shall be "unfunded" for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA. Any and all payments under the Plan shall be made solely from the general assets of Walmart. A Participant's interests under the Plan do not represent or create a claim against specific assets of Walmart or any Employer. Nothing herein shall be deemed to create a trust of any kind or create any fiduciary relationship between the Committee, Walmart or any Employer and a Participant, the Participant's beneficiary or any other person. To the extent any person acquires a right to receive payments from Walmart under this Plan, such right is no greater than the right of any other unsecured general creditor of Walmart. The Plan is intended to be in compliance with Code Section 409A and shall be interpreted, applied and administered at all times in accordance with Code Section 409A and guidance issued thereunder.
 
Whenever used in this Plan, the following words and phrases have the meaning set forth below unless the context plainly requires a different meaning:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A deferral election under this Section 3.1(b)(2) will be effective only with respect to Compensation for payroll periods beginning after the payroll period in which the Eligible Officer's election form (which may be electronic) is received by Executive Compensation.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An MIP bonus deferral election under this Section 3.2(b)(3) will be effective only with respect to an MIP bonus paid for services performed after such election. For this purpose, the amount of the MIP bonus payable to the Eligible Officer for services rendered subsequent to the Eligible Officer's election will be determined by multiplying the bonus by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days remaining in the performance period after the election and the denominator of which is the total number of calendar days in such performance period. For purposes of this Section 3.2(b)(3), the date of an Eligible Officer's election is the date the executed election form (which may be electronic) is received by Executive Compensation.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Each Participant's Account will be used solely as a measuring device to determine the amount to be paid a Participant under this Plan. The Accounts do not constitute, nor will they be treated as, property or a trust fund of any kind. All amounts at any time attributable to a Participant's Account will be, and remain, the sole property of Walmart. A Participant's rights hereunder are limited to the right to receive Plan benefits as provided herein. The Plan represents an unsecured promise by Walmart to pay the benefits provided by the Plan.
 
Deferral Credits and Employer Matching Contribution Credits will be credited to each Participant's Account as follows:
 
 
 
A Participant's Account, including earnings credited thereto, will be maintained by the Committee until the Participant's Plan benefits have been paid in full.
 
Each Participant's Account will be valued daily as of each Valuation Date.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A Participant may elect only one form of payment under the Plan for all beneficiaries (at any level.) If the Participant fails to make an effective election as provided in Section 5.4 below, the Participant will be deemed to have elected distribution in a lump sum under Section 5.3(b) for all beneficiary levels.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
provided, however, that an installment election will be given effect only if, as of the date on which any lump sum payment would be valued, the value of the Participant's Retirement Account, or, in the event of death, Account, is at least fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). Any Participant whose Retirement Account, or in the event of death, Account, is valued at less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) as of the date on which any lump sum payment would be valued shall be defaulted to a lump sum payment.
 
 
 
 
 
 
If a Participant's distribution election does not satisfy the requirements of this Section 5.4(b), it will not be recognized or given effect by the Committee. In that event, distribution of the benefit will be made in accordance with the Participant's most recent distribution election which does satisfy the requirements of this Section 5.4(b).
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a Participant's Plan benefits are contingent upon the Participant not engaging in Gross Misconduct while employed with any Employer or Related Affiliate or any entity in which Walmart has an ownership interest, or during such additional period as provided in Walmart's Statement of Ethics. In the event the Committee determines that the Participant has engaged in Gross Misconduct during the prescribed period, then notwithstanding any provisions hereunder to the contrary: (a) the Participant shall forfeit all Matching Contribution Credits and credited Plan earnings thereon; (b) earnings credited to the Participant's Deferral Account shall be recalculated for each Plan Year to reflect the amount which would otherwise have been credited if the applicable per annum rate were fifty percent (50%) of the per annum rate in effect for such Plan Year; and (c) if the Participant is then receiving installment payments, any remaining installments shall be recalculated to reflect the amount which would otherwise have been paid if the applicable per annum rate were fifty percent (50%) of the per annum rate in effect with respect to such installment payments. Under no circumstances will a Participant forfeit any portion of the Participant's Deferred Compensation, Deferred MIP Bonus and Deferred Special Bonus. Any payments received hereunder by a Participant (or the Participant's beneficiary) are contingent upon the Participant not engaging (or not having engaged) in Gross Misconduct while employed with any Employer or Related Affiliate or any entity in which Walmart has an ownership interest, or during such additional period as provided in Walmart's Statement of Ethics. If the Committee determines, after payment of amounts hereunder, that the Participant has engaged in Gross Misconduct during the prescribed period, the Participant (or the Participant's beneficiary) shall repay to Walmart any amount in excess of that to which the Participant is entitled under this Section 5.6.
 
 
The Committee is responsible for the administration of the Plan and is granted the following rights and duties:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Any claim for benefits under the Plan must be filed by the Participant or beneficiary ("claimant") in writing with the Committee or its delegate within one (1) year of the Participant's Separation from Service. If the claim is not filed within one (1) year of the Participant's Separation from Service, neither the Plan nor any Employer nor any Related Affiliate shall have any obligation to pay the benefit and the claimant shall have no further rights under the Plan. If a timely claim for a Plan benefit is wholly or partially denied, notice of the decision will be furnished to the claimant by the Committee or its delegate within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed sixty (60) days, after receipt of the claim by the Committee or its delegate. Any claimant who is denied a claim for benefits will be furnished written notice setting forth:
 
 
 
 
 
To appeal a denial of a claim, a claimant or the claimant's duly authorized representative:
 
 
 
A decision on review of a denied claim will be made by the Committee not later than sixty (60) days after receipt of a request for review, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing, in which case a decision will be rendered within a reasonable period of time, but not later than one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of a request for review. The decision on review will be in writing and shall include the specific reasons for the denial and the specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based.
 
Walmart, by action of the Committee, reserves the right to amend, suspend or to terminate the Plan in any manner that it deems advisable; provided, however, that in no event shall a Participant's Account be distributed prior to the Participant's Separation from Service (except in the event of a Participant's Unforeseeable Emergency pursuant to Section 5.5). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Plan may not be amended, suspended or terminated to cause a Participant to forfeit the Participant's then-existing Account.
Notwithstanding the preceding, Walmart may, by action of the Committee within the thirty (30) days preceding or twelve (12) months following a change in control (within the meaning of Code Section 409A) of a relevant affiliate, partially terminate the Plan and distribute benefits to all Participants involved in such change in control within twelve (12) months after such action, provided that all plans sponsored by the service recipient immediately after the change in control (which are required to be aggregated with this Plan pursuant to Code Section 409A) are also terminated and liquidated with respect to each Participant involved in the change in control.
 
No interest or amounts payable under the Plan may be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, whether voluntary or involuntary. Notwithstanding the preceding, distribution may be made to the extent necessary to fulfill a domestic relations order as defined in Code Section 414(p)(1)(B) and in accordance with procedures established by the Committee from time to time; provided, however, that all such distributions shall be made in a single lump sum payment.
 
In the event any payments under the Plan are made on account of a mistake of fact or law, the recipient shall return such payment or overpayment to Walmart as requested by Walmart.
 
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as conferring upon any Eligible Participant or Participant the right to continue in the employ of any Employer or any Related Affiliate as an officer or in any other capacity.
 
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as conferring upon the Participant the right to receive a bonus from the MIP or any other bonus or award from any Employer or a Related Affiliate. A Participant's entitlement to such a bonus or award is governed solely by the provisions of the MIP or such other plan or arrangement.
 
To the extent required by law, the Employer or a Related Affiliate will withhold from a Participant's current compensation such taxes as are required to be withheld for employment taxes. To the extent required by law, the Employer or a Related Affiliate will withhold from a Participant's Plan distributions such taxes as are required to be withheld for federal, Puerto Rican, state or local government income tax purposes.
 
The Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiaries) is solely responsible for the payment of all federal, Puerto Rican, state and local income and excise taxes resulting from the Participant's participation in this Plan.
 
The provisions of this Plan are binding upon and inure to the benefit of Walmart and each other Employer, their successors and assigns, and the Participant, the Participant's beneficiaries, heirs, and legal representatives.
 
This Plan shall be subject to and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent not preempted by federal law.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Walmart") established the Officer Deferred Compensation Plan.

An Eligible Officer who first becomes a Participant after December 31, 2008 must make an election with respect to the allocation of his or her Incentive Payments, if any, between his or her Retirement Accounts. Such election must be made within the earliest of the time periods applicable under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3. and 3.4 for making an initial deferral election for the first Plan Year of participation. In the event the Participant fails to make a timely election with respect to the allocation of his or her Incentive Payments, the Participant shall be deemed to have elected to have his or her Incentive Payments allocated entirely to his or her Retirement Account #1. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, once made (or deemed made), a Participant's allocation election under this Section 3.5 is irrevocable.

As of any date during a Plan Year, Walmart may credit to a Participant's Company Account an amount determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, which amount may differ among Participants or categories of Participants designated by the Committee. A Participant shall become vested in his or her Company Account, plus earnings thereon, in accordance with the vesting schedule imposed by the Committee. The Participant's Company Account shall be distributed pursuant to Article V only to the extent vested as of the applicable distribution date.

Each Participant's Account will be used solely as a measuring device to determine the amount to be paid a Participant under this Plan. The Accounts do not constitute, nor will they be treated as, property or a trust fund of any kind. All amounts at any time attributable to a Participant's Account will be, and remain, the sole property of Walmart. A Participant's rights hereunder are limited to the right to receive Plan benefits as provided herein. The Plan represents an unsecured promise by Walmart to pay the benefits provided by the Plan.
 
Effective April 1, 2008, each Participant's Account will be valued daily as of each Valuation Date.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a Participant's Plan benefits are contingent upon the Participant not engaging in Gross Misconduct while employed with Walmart or any Employer or any entity in which Walmart has an ownership interest, or during such additional period as provided in Walmart's Statement of Ethics. In the event the Committee determines that the Participant has engaged in Gross Misconduct during the prescribed period, then notwithstanding any provisions hereunder to the contrary: (a) the Participant shall forfeit all Employer Contribution Credits and Incentive Payments, and credited Plan earnings thereon; (b) earnings credited to the Participant's Account derived from Deferred Compensation, Deferred Bonuses, Deferred Special Bonuses, Deferred Retention Bonuses and Deferred Equity shall be recalculated for each Plan Year to reflect the amount which would otherwise have been credited if the applicable per annum rate were fifty percent (50%) of the per annum rate in effect for such Plan Year; and (c) if the Participant is then receiving installment payments, any remaining installments shall be recalculated to reflect the amount which would otherwise have been paid if the applicable per annum rate were fifty percent (50%) of the per annum rate in effect with respect to such installment payments. Under no circumstances will a Participant forfeit any portion of the Participant's Deferred Compensation, Deferred Bonuses, Deferred Special Bonuses, Deferred Retention Bonuses or Deferred Equity. Any payments received hereunder by a Participant (or the Participant's beneficiary) are contingent upon the Participant not engaging (or not having engaged) in Gross Misconduct while employed with Walmart or any Employer or any entity in which Walmart has an ownership interest, or during such additional period as provided in Walmart's Statement of

Ethics. If the Committee determines, after payment of amounts hereunder, that the Participant has engaged in Gross Misconduct during the prescribed period, the Participant (or the Participant's beneficiary) shall repay to Walmart any amount in excess of that to which the Participant is entitled under this Section 5.6.
 
The Committee is responsible for the administration of the Plan and is granted the following rights and duties:

Walmart, by action of the Committee, reserves the right to amend, suspend or to terminate the Plan in any manner that it deems advisable; provided, however, that in no event shall a Participant's Account be distributed prior to the Participant's Separation from Service (except in the event of a Participant's Unforeseeable Emergency pursuant to Section 5.5). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Plan may not be amended, suspended or terminated to cause a Participant to forfeit the Participant's then-existing Account.
Notwithstanding the preceding, Walmart may, by action of the Committee within the thirty (30) days preceding or twelve (12) months following a change in control (within the meaning of Code Section 409A) of a relevant affiliate, partially terminate the Plan and distribute benefits to all Participants involved in such change in control within twelve (12) months after such action, provided that all plans sponsored by the service recipient immediately after the change in control (which are required to be aggregated with this Plan pursuant to Code Section 409A) are also terminated and liquidated with respect to each Participant involved in the change in control.
 
No interest or amounts payable under the Plan may be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, whether voluntary or involuntary.

Amounts deferred and vested on or before December 31, 2004 are subject to the terms of the Plan as it existed as of such date, which Plan is set forth in this Appendix A. The terms of this Appendix A shall not be materially modified (as that phrase is defined by Code Section 409A and guidance thereunder), either formally or informally, unless such modification specifically provides that it is intended to be a material modification within the meaning of Code Section 409A and guidance thereunder.
 
The purpose of the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Officer Deferred Compensation Plan ("Plan") is to: (a) attract and retain the valuable services of certain officers; (b) recognize, reward, and encourage contributions by such officers to the success of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Walmart") and its Related Affiliates; and (c) enable such officers to defer certain compensation and bonuses, and to be credited with earnings and Incentive Payments with respect to such amounts.
 
This Plan was initially effective February l, 1996 with respect to compensation and bonuses deferred (and credited earnings thereon) under the Plan on or after February 1, 1996. In addition, prior to February 1, 1995, certain Eligible Officers entered into deferred compensation agreements ("Prior Agreements") with Walmart containing terms similar to those contained in this Plan. Except as expressly provided herein, effective February 1, 1996 the Prior Agreements were amended and restated in the form of this Plan.
The Plan as initially adopted effective February 1, 1996, was amended from time-to-time, most recently by Amendment No. Three to the February 1, 1997 amended and restated Plan. The effective date of this amended and restated Plan is March 31, 2003, except as otherwise expressly provided herein.
 
The Plan is intended to be (and shall be administered as) an unfunded employee pension plan benefiting a select group of management or highly compensated employees under the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"). The Plan shall be "unfunded" for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA. Any and all payments

under the Plan shall be made solely from the general assets of Walmart and, to the extent such payments or benefits are attributable to services with a respective Related Affiliate or Related Affiliates, such Related Affiliate or Related Affiliates. For this purpose, payments or benefits under the Plan are deemed to be attributable to services with the last Related Affiliate by whom the Participant was employed at or prior to the time benefits become payable under Article V. A Participant's interests under the Plan do not represent or create a claim against specific assets of Walmart or any Related Affiliate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to create a trust of any kind or create any fiduciary relationship between Walmart, any Related Affiliate or the Committee, and a Participant, the Participant's beneficiary or any other person. To the extent any person acquires a right to receive payments from Walmart or a Related Affiliate under this Plan, such right is no greater than the right of any other unsecured general creditor of Walmart or such Related Affiliate.

The need to send a Participant's child to college or the desire to purchase a home does not constitute an Unforeseeable Emergency. The existence of an Unforeseeable Emergency will be determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, based upon the Participant's facts and circumstance and in accordance with restrictions imposed by the Code or guidance thereunder.

For each Plan Year, each Eligible Officer may elect to defer all or a portion of what would otherwise be the Eligible Officer's federal taxable base compensation, net of employment taxes and estimated bi-weekly deductions as are determined to be in effect on the first day of the deferral period, to be paid for such Plan Year by Walmart or a Related Affiliate designated by Walmart as a participating employer. Amounts deferred (the "Deferred Compensation") will be deferred pro ratably for each payroll period of the Plan Year. All deferral elections made under this Section 3.1 must be filed with the Committee on forms approved by the Committee. Deferral elections must be (a) filed no later than the day preceding the Plan Year for which the deferral election is to be effective; or (b) with respect to an Eligible Officer appointed during the Plan Year, within thirty (30) days of such appointment. Individuals appointed as Eligible Officers on or after April 1, 2003 and before October 1, 2003 shall have thirty (30) days from such latter date to file a deferral election for the balance of the Plan Year.
Once made for a Plan Year, a deferral election may not be revoked, changed or modified. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the event an Eligible Officer ceases to be employed as an Eligible Officer, such former Eligible Officer's deferral election shall automatically cease with respect to compensation earned on or after the individual ceases to be an Eligible Officer. A deferral election for one (1) Plan Year will not automatically be given effect for a subsequent Plan Year, so that if deferrals are desired for a subsequent Plan Year, a separate election must be made by the Eligible Officer for such Plan Year. An Eligible Officer's deferral election shall remain in effect with respect to any portion of base compensation paid while on a leave of absence, and, if the leave of absence is unpaid, shall resume upon return from the leave of absence during the same Plan Year and shall continue in effect for the balance of such Plan Year.
 
Each Eligible Officer may elect to defer all or a portion of the Eligible Officer's bonus (if any) for a Fiscal Year under the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Management Incentive Plan for Officers. All bonus deferral elections made under this Section 3.2 must be made on forms approved by the Committee, and be filed with the Committee: (a) for the 1996-1997 Fiscal Year, no later than January 31, 1996; (b) for Fiscal Years beginning on or after February 1, 1997, no later than the March 31 of the Fiscal Year for which such bonus (if any) is payable; and (c) within thirty (30) days of the individual's appointment as an Eligible Officer if the Eligible Officer is newly appointed after March 31 of the Fiscal Year. Individuals appointed as Eligible Officers on or after April 1, 2003 and before October 1, 2003 shall have thirty (30) days from such latter date to file a bonus deferral election with respect to the February 1, 2003 - January 31, 2004 Fiscal Year.
Once made for a Fiscal Year, a bonus deferral election may not be revoked, changed or modified. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the event an Eligible Officer ceases to be employed as an Eligible Officer but remains employed by Walmart or by one of its Related Affiliates, such former Eligible Officer's bonus deferral election shall automatically cease with respect to that portion of a bonus earned on or after the date the individual ceases to be an

Eligible Officer. For this purpose, the portion of a bonus earned on or after ceasing to be an Eligible Officer shall be determined by multiplying the bonus by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in such Fiscal Year in which the individual ceased to be an Eligible Officer, and the denominator of which is the total calendar days in such Fiscal Year. Effective for those bonuses payable for Fiscal Years beginning on or after February 1, 2003, in the event an Eligible Officer ceases to be employed as an Eligible Officer due to a Termination of Employment, or if an Eligible Officer takes an approved leave of absence, such Eligible Officer's bonus deferral election shall remain in effect with respect to that portion of a bonus earned while an Eligible Officer, even if such bonus is awarded after a Termination of Employment or while an Eligible Officer is on an approved leave of absence.
With respect to those Eligible Officers appointed on or after the first day of a Plan Year and who elect to defer all or a portion of their bonus (if any) for that initial Fiscal Year, such deferral elections shall apply only to that portion of the bonus earned after the date of such election, by multiplying the bonus by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in such Fiscal Year in which the individual elected to defer all or a portion of their bonus after first becoming appointed as an Eligible Officer, and the denominator of which is the total calendar days in such Fiscal Year. A bonus deferral election for one (1) Fiscal Year will not automatically be given effect for a subsequent Fiscal Year, so that if deferrals are desired for a subsequent Fiscal Year, a separate election must be made by the Eligible Officer for such Fiscal Year.
 
The Deferred Compensation, Deferred Bonuses, and Incentive Payments will be credited to a bookkeeping account ("Grandfathered Account") established by the Committee on behalf of each Participant. The Deferred Compensation will be credited to the Participant's Grandfathered Account as of the last day of the Plan Year during which the Deferred Compensation would otherwise be payable to the Participant. The Deferred Bonus will be credited to the Participant's Grandfathered Account as of the date the bonus would have otherwise been paid in cash. The Incentive Payments will be credited to the Participant's Grandfathered Account as of the last day of the Plan Year specified in Section 4.2. A Participant's Grandfathered Account, including earnings credited thereto, will be maintained by the Committee until the Participant's Plan benefits have been paid in full.
 
Each Participant's Grandfathered Account will be used solely as a measuring device to determine the amount to be paid a Participant under this Plan. The Grandfathered Accounts do not constitute, nor will they be treated as, property or a trust fund of any kind. All amounts at any time attributable to a Participant's Grandfathered Account will be, and remain, the sole property of Walmart and its Related Affiliates. A Participant's rights hereunder are limited to the right to receive Plan benefits as provided herein. The Plan represents an unsecured promise by Walmart and the applicable Related Affiliate to pay the benefits provided by the Plan.
 
Table of Contents
Each Participant's Grandfathered Account will be valued annually as of each Annual Valuation Date. The value of an Grandfathered Account as of any applicable Annual Valuation Date is the sum of the Grandfathered Account value as of the immediately preceding Annual Valuation Date, the Deferred Compensation, Deferred Bonuses and Incentive Payments allocated as of the applicable Annual Valuation Date, and the equivalent of interest credited to the Grandfathered Account under Section 4.1 as of the applicable Annual Valuation Date, less any distributions for Unforeseeable Emergencies since the preceding Annual Valuation Date but on or before the applicable Annual Valuation Date.
[Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, effective April 1, 2008, Grandfathered Accounts shall be credited with interest on a daily basis. The amount of interest to be credited each day shall be a daily rate of simple interest based on the interest rate in effect for the Plan Year as provided in Section 4.1. Also, effective January 1, 2009, the Plan Year for such purpose shall be the twelve-month period February 1 through January 31, with the period April 1, 2009 through January 31, 2010 being a short Plan Year. This Appendix A shall be construed in accordance with such modifications. It has been determined that these modifications do not constitute "material modifications" for purposes of Code Section 409A.]
 
For each Plan Year a Participant's Grandfathered Account will be credited with the equivalent of interest at the per annum rate established for such Plan Year by the Committee; provided, however, for the February 1, 1997 - March 31, 1997 Plan Year, the equivalent of interest shall be credited at one-sixth (1/6) of the per annum rate so established for such period. The per annum rate may be increased or decreased for any Plan Year to reflect changes in prevailing interest rates, as determined at the sole discretion of the Committee. Except for a Plan Year in which a Participant receives a distribution due to an Unforeseeable Emergency, the amount to be credited to a Participant's Grandfathered Account as of any Annual Valuation Date is the sum of: (a) the applicable per annum rate multiplied by the Participant's Grandfathered Account value as of the immediately preceding Annual Valuation Date; (b) fifty percent (50%) of the Participant's Deferred Compensation for the Plan Year ending on the Annual Valuation Date multiplied by the applicable full annum rate; and (c) effective for Deferred Bonuses attributable to Fiscal Years beginning on or after February 1, 2003, a pro rata amount of interest equivalent at the applicable per annum rate based upon the number of days from the date such bonus would have otherwise been paid in cash through the applicable Annual Valuation Date.
[: The annual rate in effect for a Plan Year for this purpose shall be determined in accordance with the following formula in effect as of October 3, 2004: the rate on 10-year Treasury notes determined as of the first business day of January preceding each Plan Year, plus 270 basis points. Such formula shall not be modified on or after October 3, 2004. Notwithstanding the preceding, in light of uncertainty regarding whether adjustment of the
NOTE
 
Table of Contents
annual rate would constitute a material modification of the Plan for Code Section 409A purposes, the annual rate was not adjusted for 2005. The annual rate for 2006 and future years will be adjusted in accordance with the above formula.]
For a Plan Year in which a Participant receives a distribution due to an Unforeseeable Emergency, the amount to be credited to the Participant's Grandfathered Account as of the applicable Annual Valuation Date is the sum of: (a) an equivalent amount of pro rata interest on the Participant's Grandfathered Account value as of the preceding Annual Valuation Date based upon the number of full calendar months in the Plan Year which the Grandfathered Account was not reduced due to the distribution; (b) an equivalent amount of pro rata interest on the Grandfathered Account value immediately after the distribution based upon the number of calendar months in the Plan Year in which the Participant's Grandfathered Account was reduced; (c) fifty percent (50%) of the Participant's Deferred Compensation for the Plan Year ending on the Annual Valuation Date multiplied by the applicable full annum rate; and (d) effective for Deferred Bonuses attributable to Fiscal Years beginning on or after February 1, 2003, a pro rata amount of interest equivalent at the applicable per annum rate based upon the number of days from the date such bonus would have otherwise been paid in cash through the applicable Annual Valuation Date.
 
The Incentive Payments described below will be credited to a Participant's Grandfathered Account. Incentive Payments awarded and credited to a Participant's Grandfathered Account under a Prior Agreement (such Incentive Payments were previously referred to as "incentive bonuses" under the Prior Agreements), and credited interest thereon, will remain credited to a Participant's Grandfathered Account hereunder as of January 31, 1996. Thereafter, a Participant's entitlement to an Incentive Payment will be governed by this Section 4.2, including any Incentive Payment which may be awarded with respect to recognized Deferred Compensation (and credited earnings thereon) deferred under a Prior Agreement. Incentive Payments hereunder shall not duplicate any Incentive Payment awarded and credited under a Prior Agreement as of January 31, 1996.

NOTE
 
Except in the event of a Participant's Unforeseeable Emergency, Plan benefits will not be payable to a Participant prior to the earliest occurrence of the Participant's Retirement, Early Retirement, Termination of Employment, Disability or death.
 
 
In the event of a Participant's Termination of Employment for reasons other than the Participant's Retirement, Early Retirement, Disability or death, the Participant's Plan benefits will be distributed in a lump sum under Section 5.2(b) or Section 5.2(c), as applicable, within sixty (60) days after the end of the calendar month in which the Termination of Employment occurs; provided, however, that if the Participant's Termination of Employment occurs after the Participant has attained age fifty (50), the Participant's Plan benefits will be distributed in a lump sum under Section 5.2(b) or Section 5.2(c), as applicable, or, subject to the minimum account value restrictions of Section 5.6 below, in substantially equal annual installments under Section 5.2(e) over a period not to exceed fifteen (15) years, in accordance with the Participant's distribution election given effect under the provisions of Section 5.6 below.
 
If the Participant's Termination of Employment occurs on the last business day (excluding for this purpose, Saturday and Sunday) of a Plan Year, the lump sum amount will be the sum of: (1) the value of the Participant's Grandfathered Account, as determined under Section 3.5, as of the Annual Valuation Date coincident with or immediately following the Participant's Termination of Employment and (2) a pro rata amount of interest equivalent (determined at the per annum rate in effect for the Plan Year in which distribution occurs) on the amount determined in (1) through the date of distribution based upon the number of calendar days since such Annual Valuation Date.
 
If the Participant's Termination of Employment occurs on a date other than the last business day (excluding for this purpose, Saturday and Sunday) of a Plan Year, the lump sum amount will equal the sum of: (1) the value of the Participant's Grandfathered Account as of the Annual Valuation Date immediately preceding Termination of Employment; (2) a pro rata amount of interest equivalent (determined at the per annum rate in effect for a Plan Year

under Section 4.1) on the Participant's Grandfathered Account value as of such immediately preceding Annual Valuation Date based upon the number of calendar days since such Annual Valuation Date through the date of distribution; (3) the Participant's Deferred Compensation for the Plan Year in which Termination of Employment occurs; (4) a pro rata amount of interest equivalent (determined by multiplying fifty percent (50%) of the amount determined in (3) by the applicable full annum rate in effect for a Plan Year under Section 4.1) based upon the number of calendar days since the Annual Valuation Date immediately preceding Termination of Employment through the date of distribution; and (5) the Participant's Incentive Payments (if any) as provided in Section 4.2(f).
 
In the event of a Participant's death before full payment of Plan benefits under this Section 5.2, payment shall be made (or continue to be made) to the Participant's beneficiary designated under Section 5.5 in accordance with Participant's separate election for death benefits under Section 5.6, or, with respect to those Participants in pay status who die on or after October 1, 2003, if the Participant did not designate a beneficiary under Section 5.5 or if no such beneficiary survives the Participant, payment shall be made in the form of a lump sum to the Participant's estate.
 
If distribution is to be made in the form of annual installments pursuant to Section 5.2(a), the Participant's installments will be based upon the value of the Participant's Grandfathered Account as of the January 31 coincident with or immediately following the Participant's Termination of Employment. For this purpose, the Participant's Grandfathered Account value as of such January 31 shall be equal to the sum of: (1) the value of the Participant's Grandfathered Account as of the Annual Valuation Date immediately preceding the Participant's Termination of Employment; (2) a pro rata amount of interest equivalent (determined at the applicable per annum rate in effect for a Plan Year under Section 4.1) on the Participant's Grandfathered Account value as of such immediately preceding Annual Valuation Date based upon the number of calendar days since such Annual Valuation Date through the January 31; (3) the Participant's Deferred Compensation for the Plan Year in which Termination of Employment occurs; (4) the Participant's Incentive Payments (if any) as provided in Section 4.2(e) or Section 4.2(f); and (5) a pro rata amount of interest equivalent (determined by multiplying fifty percent (50%) of the amount determined in (3) by the applicable full annum rate in effect for a Plan Year under Section 4.1) based upon the number of calendar days since the Annual Valuation Date immediately preceding Termination of Employment through such January 31.
Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if the Participant's Termination of Employment occurs on a January 31 (excluding for this purpose, Saturday and Sunday), the Participant's installments will be based upon the sum of: (1) the value of the Participant's Grandfathered Account as of the Annual Valuation Date immediately following the Participant's Termination of Employment; (2) a pro rata amount of interest equivalent (determined at the applicable per annum rate in effect for a Plan Year under Section 4.1) on the Participant's Grandfathered Account value as of such immediately following Annual Valuation Date based upon the number of calendar days since such Annual Valuation Date through the following January 31; and (3) the Participant's Incentive Payments (if any) as provided in Section 4.2(e) or Section 4.2(f).

The Plan benefits determined above will be paid in equal annual installments in an amount which would fully amortize a loan equal to such Plan benefits over the period covered by the installment period (such period commencing on the February 1 following the January 31 on which the Participant's Grandfathered Account is valued under this Section), with interest calculated at the per annum rate in effect for the Plan Year in which the Participant's Termination of Employment occurs. The first installment will be paid as of the January 31 following the Participant's Termination of Employment, and continue on each successive January 31 until the Participant's benefits are distributed in full. For purposes of the preceding sentence, it is expressly provided that, if a Participant's Termination of Employment occurs on a January 31, the first installment will be paid on the next-following January 31.
 
 
In the event of a Participant's Termination of Employment due to the Participant's Retirement, Early Retirement or Disability, the Participant's Plan benefits will be distributed in a lump sum or in substantially equal annual installments over a period not to exceed fifteen (15) years, subject to the minimum account value restrictions of Section 5.6 below and in accordance with the Participant's distribution election given effect under the provisions of Section 5.6 below.
 
If distribution is to be made in the form of a lump sum, the Participant's Plan benefits will be distributed within sixty (60) days after the end of the calendar month in which the Retirement, Early Retirement or Disability occurs. If the Participant's Retirement, Early Retirement or Disability occurs on the last business day (excluding for this purpose Saturday and Sunday) of a Plan Year, the lump sum amount will be the sum of: (1) the value of the Participant's Grandfathered Account, as determined under Section 3.5, as of the Annual Valuation Date coincident with or immediately following the Participant's Retirement, Early Retirement or Disability; (2) a pro rata amount of interest equivalent (determined at the per annum rate in effect for the Plan Year in which distribution occurs) on the amount determined in (1) through the date of distribution based upon the number of calendar days since such Annual Valuation Date; and (3) the Participant's Incentive Payment (if any) as provided in Section 4.2(e).

In the event of a Participant's death before full payment of Plan benefits under this Section 5.3, payment shall be made (or continue to be made) to the Participant's beneficiary designated under Section 5.5 in accordance with Participant's separate election for death benefits under Section 5.6, or, with respect to those Participants in pay status who die on or after October 1, 2003, if the Participant did not designate a beneficiary under Section 5.5 or if no such beneficiary survives the Participant, payment shall be made in the form of a lump sum to the Participant's estate.
 
 
In the event of a Participant's Termination of Employment due to the Participant's death, the Participant's Plan benefits will be distributed in a lump sum or, subject to the minimum account value restrictions of Section 5.6 below, in substantially equal annual installments over a period not to exceed fifteen (15) years, in accordance with the Participant's distribution election given effect under the provisions of Section 5.6 below. Amounts will be distributed to the beneficiary designated under 5.5 below.
 
If distribution is to be made in the form of a lump sum, the Participant's Plan benefits will be distributed within sixty (60) days after the end of the calendar month in which the Participant's death occurs. If the Participant's death occurs on the last business day (excluding for this purpose Saturday and Sunday) of a Plan Year, the lump sum amount will be the sum of: (1) the value of the Participant's Grandfathered Account, as determined under Section 3.5, as of the Annual Valuation Date coincident with or immediately following the Participant's death; (2) a pro rata amount of interest equivalent (determined at the per annum rate in effect for the Plan Year in which distribution occurs) on the amount determined in (1) through the date of distribution based upon the number of calendar days since such Annual Valuation Date; and (4) the Participant's Incentive Payment (if any) as provided in Section 4.2(e).

If distribution is to be made in the form of annual installments, the installments will be based upon the value of the Participant's Grandfathered Account as of the January 31 coincident with or immediately following the Participant's death. For this purpose, a Participant's Grandfathered Account value as of such January 31 shall be determined in accordance with the manner specified in Section 5.3(c). The Plan benefits determined
-
above will be paid in equal annual installments in an amount which would fully amortize a loan equal to such Plan benefits over the period covered by the installment period (such period commencing on the February 1 following the January 31 on which the Participant's Grandfathered Account is valued under this Section), with interest calculated at the per annum rate in effect for the Plan Year in which the Participant's death occurs. The first installment will be paid as of the January 31 coincident with or following the Participant's death; and continue on each successive January 31 until the Participant's benefits are distributed in full. For purposes of the preceding sentence, it is expressly provided that if a Participant dies on a January 31, the first installment will be paid on the next-following January 31.
 
A Participant may, by written or electronic instrument delivered to the Committee in the form prescribed by the Committee, designate primary and contingent beneficiaries to receive any benefit payments which may be payable under this Plan following the Participant's death, and may designate the proportions in which such beneficiaries are to receive such payments. Any such designation will apply to both the Participant's Account (as defined in the Plan) and his or her Grandfathered Account, if any; a Participant may not designate different beneficiaries for his or her Account and Grandfathered Account. A Participant may change such designations from time to time and the last written designation filed with the Committee prior to the Participant's death will control. In the event no beneficiary is designated, or if the designated beneficiary predeceases the Participant, payment shall be payable to the Participant's estate. For this purpose, a Participant's most recent written beneficiary designation properly filed under a Prior Agreement shall continue to be given effect until otherwise modified in accordance with the provisions of this Section.
 
If a Participant's Termination of Employment is due to the Participant's Retirement, Early Retirement Disability or death, or occurs after the Participant has attained age fifty (50), distribution may be made, at the Participant's election, in a lump sum or in substantially equal annual installments over a period not to exceed fifteen (15) years; provided, however, with respect to Terminations of Employment occurring on or after October 1, 2003, an installment election will be given effect only if, as of the date on which any lump sum payment would be valued, the participant's Grandfathered Account is valued at greater than fifty-thousand dollars ($50,000). Any Participant whose Grandfathered Account is valued at less than fifty-thousand dollars as of the date on which any lump sum payment would be valued shall be defaulted to a lump sum payment. A Participant may file a distribution election with the Committee on forms prescribed by the Committee. A distribution election, once given effect under this Section 5.6, will apply to the Participant's total Plan benefits. A Participant may, however, file a separate election for death benefits payable under Section 5.2 - 5.4. To be given effect under this Section
 
Table of Contents
5.6, any distribution election for benefits payable under Section 5.2 or Section 5.3 to the Participant must have been filed with the Committee at least six (6) full calendar months before the occurrence of an event entitling the Participant to a distribution thereunder. If a Participant's distribution election has not been on file with the Committee for the full six (6)-month period, it will not be recognized or given effect by the Plan. In that event, distribution will be made in accordance with the Participant's most recent distribution election which was filed with the Committee at least six (6) months prior to the Participant's Retirement, Early Retirement, Disability, or Termination of Employment after age fifty (50). The six (6)- month period provided above shall not apply to death benefits payable under Section 5.2 - 5.4. For purposes of this Section 5.6, a Participant's last distribution election filed with Walmart under a Prior Agreement will be given effect for the Participant's total Plan benefits until superseded or amended by the Participant in accordance with the provisions of this Section, except that death benefits under Section 5.4 will be paid in a lump sum unless an affirmative election to the contrary is filed by the Participant. If the Participant has not been a Participant in the Plan for at least six (6) months prior to the Participant's Retirement, Early Retirement Disability, or Termination of Employment after age fifty (50), the Participant's initial distribution election filed with Walmart will be given effect. For purposes of this Section 5.6, it is expressly provided that any installment election which would be given effect hereunder for benefits payable under Section 5.3 shall automatically be given effect for Participants who incur a Termination of Employment on or after June 1, 1999 and after attaining age fifty (50), without the consent or ratification of any such Participant.
 
A Participant's Plan benefits are contingent upon the Participant not engaging in Gross Misconduct while employed with Walmart or any Related Affiliate or any entity in which Walmart has an ownership interest, or during such additional period as provided in Walmart's Statement of Ethics. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event the Committee determines that the Participant has engaged in Gross Misconduct during the prescribed period: (a) the Participant shall forfeit all Incentive Payments, and credited Plan earnings thereon; and (b) earnings credited to the Participant's Grandfathered Account derived from Deferred Compensation and Deferred Bonuses shall be recalculated for each Plan Year to reflect the amount which would otherwise have been credited if the applicable per annum rate were fifty percent (50%) of the per annum rate in effect for such Plan Year. Under no circumstances will a Participant forfeit any portion of the Participant's Deferred Compensation or Deferred Bonuses. Any payments received hereunder by a Participant (or the Participant's beneficiary) are contingent upon the Participant not engaging (or not having engaged) in Gross Misconduct while employed with Walmart or any Related Affiliate or any entity in which Walmart has an ownership interest, or during such additional period as provided in Walmart's Statement of Business Ethics. If the Committee determines, after payment of amounts hereunder, that the Participant has engaged in Gross Misconduct during the prescribed period, the Participant (or the Participant's beneficiary) shall repay to Walmart, or the applicable Related Affiliate, any amount in excess of that to which the Participant is entitled under this Section 5.7.
 
In the event of an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion and upon written application of such Participant, may direct immediate distribution of

all or a portion of the Participant's Plan benefits. The Committee will permit distribution because of an Unforeseeable Emergency only to the extent reasonably needed to satisfy the emergency need.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the provisions of this paragraph apply in the event a Participant receives a distribution under this Section 5.8, the Participant's Termination of Employment for any reason occurs on a date other than the last business day of a Fiscal Year (excluding for this purpose Saturday or Sunday), and the Participant's benefits hereunder for any reason are paid in the same Fiscal Year in which the Participant received a distribution for Unforeseeable Emergencies under this Section 5.8. In that event, the Participant's lump sum amount calculated under Sections 5.2, 5.3, or 5.4 will be reduced by the amount distributed under this Section 5.8 and the applicable interest equivalent will be calculated in a manner consistent with Section 4.1.
 
The Committee is responsible for the administration of the Plan and is granted the following rights and duties:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
 
Any claim for benefits under the Plan must be filed by the Participant or beneficiary ("claimant") in writing with the Committee or its delegate. If a claim for a Plan benefit is wholly or partially denied, notice of the decision will be furnished to the claimant by the Committee or its delegate within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed sixty (60) days, after receipt of the claim by the Committee or its delegate. Any claimant who is denied a claim for benefits will be furnished written notice setting forth:

A decision on review of a denied claim will be made by the Committee not later than sixty (60) days after receipt of a request for review, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing, in which case a decision will be rendered within a reasonable period of time, but not later than one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of a request for review. The decision on review will be in writing and shall include the specific reasons for the denial and the specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based.
 
Walmart, by action of the Committee, reserves the right to amend, suspend or to terminate the Plan in any manner that it deems advisable. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Plan may not be amended, suspended or terminated to cause a Participant to forfeit the Participant's then-existing Grandfathered Account.

The rights of a Participant to the payment of benefits as provided in the Plan may not be assigned, transferred, pledged or encumbered or be subject in any manner to alienation or anticipation. No Participant may borrow against the Participant's interest in the Plan. No interest or amounts payable under the Plan may be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, whether voluntary or involuntary. Notwithstanding the preceding, distribution may be made to the extent necessary to fulfill a domestic relations order as defined in Code Section 414(p)(1)(B) and in accordance with procedures established by the Committee from time to time; provided, however, that all such distributions shall be made in a single lump sum payment.
 
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as conferring upon the Participant the right to continue in the employ of Walmart or any of its Related Affiliates as an officer or in any other capacity.
 
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as conferring upon the Participant the right to receive a bonus from the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Management Incentive Plan for Officers. A Participant's entitlement to such a bonus is governed solely by the provisions of that plan.
 
To the extent required by law, Walmart, or a Related Affiliate will withhold from a Participant's current compensation or from Plan distributions, as the case may be, such taxes as are required to be withheld for federal, state or local government purposes.
 
The Participant (or the Participant's beneficiaries or estate) is solely responsible for the payment of all federal, state and local income and excise taxes resulting from the Participant's participation in this Plan.
 
In the event any payments under the Plan are made on account of a mistake of fact or law, the recipient shall return such payment or overpayment to Walmart as requested by Walmart.

Table of Contents
 
The purpose of this Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan is to supplement the Walmart 401(k) Plan and the Walmart Puerto Rico 401(k) Plan. This Plan is intended to be in compliance with Code Section 409A and shall be interpreted, applied and administered at all times in accordance with Code Section 409A and guidance issued thereunder.
 
This Plan was initially effective January 31, 1990. The Plan has been amended from time to time, most recently effective January 1, 2009. The Plan is hereby further amended and restated as of February 1, 2011 (except as otherwise specifically stated herein).
 
The Plan is intended to be (and shall be administered as) an unfunded employee pension plan benefiting a select group of management or highly compensated employees under the provisions of ERISA. The Plan shall be "unfunded" for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA. Any and all payments under the Plan shall be made solely from the general assets of Walmart. A Participant's interests under the Plan do not represent or create a claim against specific assets of Walmart or any Employer. Nothing herein shall be deemed to create a trust of any kind or create any fiduciary relationship between the Committee, Walmart or any Employer and a Participant, a Participant's Beneficiary or any other person. To the extent any person acquires a right to receive payments from Walmart under this Plan, such right is no greater than the right of any other unsecured general creditor of Walmart.
 
Except as otherwise expressly provided below, capitalized terms used in the Plan shall have the same meanings as set forth for such terms in the 401(k) Plan, and such 401(k) Plan definitions and operative terms are incorporated herein by reference. Should there be any conflict between the meanings of terms used in the Plan and the meaning of terms used in the 401(k) Plan, the meaning as set forth in the Plan shall prevail.

The following individuals shall be eligible to participate in the Plan:
 
 
Notwithstanding the above, Participants shall not include 401(k) Plan participants who are primarily compensated on a commission basis.
 
An eligible individual under Section 3.1 shall become a Plan Participant on the later of:
 
 
provided, however, that no new Participant shall be added to the Plan on or after February 1, 2013.
Once amounts are credited to a Participant's Account under Section 4.2, such individual shall remain a Participant until his or her Account is distributed in full in accordance with Article V; provided, however, in order for the Participant's Account to be credited with employer contributions credits for a Plan Year, the Participant must satisfy the requirements of Section 4.2 for such Plan Year.
 
A Participant's Account shall be used solely as a measuring device to determine the amount (if any) to be paid to a Participant. No amounts shall actually be set aside with respect to any Account. All amounts at any time attributable to an Account shall be, and remain, the sole property of Walmart. A Participant's rights hereunder are limited to the right to receive Plan benefits as provided herein. An Account represents an unsecured promise by Walmart to pay the benefits provided by the Plan.

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.2 to the contrary, in no event will an initial contribution be made to a Participant's Account unless the aggregate of such initial contributions is at least one hundred dollars ($100).

A Participant may, by written or electronic instrument delivered to the Committee in the form prescribed by the Committee, designate primary and contingent beneficiaries to receive any benefit payments which may be payable under this Plan following the Participant's death, and may designate the proportions in which such beneficiaries are to receive such payments. A Participant may change such designation from time to time and the last written designation filed with the Committee prior to the Participant's death will control. In the event no beneficiaries are designated, or if the designated beneficiaries die before the Participant's Account is distributed, the Account shall be paid to the Participant's beneficiary given effect with respect to the Participant's Profit Sharing Contribution Account under the 401(k) Plan, whether an affirmative or default election. In the event the Participant has a beneficiary designation in effect with respect to a Profit Sharing Contribution Account under both the Walmart 401(k) Plan and the Walmart Puerto Rico 401(k) Plan, the beneficiary designation for the Plan in which the Participant was a participant immediately preceding his or her death shall apply.
 
In no event shall benefits hereunder be payable to a Participant prior to the Participant's Separation from Service.
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a Participant's Plan benefits are contingent upon the Participant not engaging in Gross Misconduct while employed with Walmart, any Employer, or any entity in which Walmart has an ownership interest, or during such additional period as provided in Walmart's Statement of Ethics. In the event the Committee determines that a Participant has engaged in Gross Misconduct during the prescribed period, then notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Participant's Account shall be recalculated as if no employer contributions were credited to the Participant's Account under Section 4.2 (including adjustments for earnings or losses thereon under Section 4.3) on or after January 31, 1996. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, such a Participant's Plan benefits (if any)
 
Table of Contents
shall be based upon the amount recalculated under the preceding sentence. Any payments received hereunder by a Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary) are contingent upon the Participant not engaging (or not having engaged) in Gross Misconduct while employed with Walmart or any Employer, or during such additional period as provided in Walmart's Statement of Ethics. If the Committee determines, after payment of amounts hereunder, that the Participant has engaged in Gross Misconduct during the prescribed period, the Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary) shall repay to Walmart any amount in excess of that to which the Participant is entitled under this Section 6.1.
 
The Committee is responsible for the management, interpretation and administration of the Plan. The Committee shall have discretionary authority with respect to the determination of benefits under the Plan and the construction and interpretation of Plan provisions. In such capacity, the Committee is granted the following rights and duties:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
 
 
A Participant or Beneficiary ("claimant") who believes he or she is entitled to Plan benefits which have not been paid may file a written claim for benefits with the Committee within one (1) year of the Participant's Separation from Service. If any such claim is not filed within one (1) year of the Participant's Separation from Service, neither the Plan nor Walmart or any Employer shall have any obligation to pay the disputed benefit and the claimant shall have no further rights under the Plan. If a timely claim for a Plan benefit is wholly or partially denied, notice of the decision will be furnished to the claimant by the Committee within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed sixty (60) days (or forty-five (45) days in the event of a claim involving a Disability determination), after receipt of the claim by the Committee. The Committee may extend the initial period up to any additional sixty (60) days (or thirty (30) days, in the case of a claim involving a Disability determination), provided the Committee determines that the extension is necessary due to matters beyond the Plan's control and the claimant is notified of the extension before the end of the initial sixty (60)-day (or, as applicable, forty-five (45)-day) period and the date by which the Committee expects to render a decision. (In the case of a claim involving a Disability determination, the Committee may extend this period for an additional thirty (30) days if the claimant is notified of the extension before the end of the initial thirty (30)-day extension.) Any claimant who is denied a claim for benefits will be furnished written notice setting forth:

A decision on review of a denied claim will be made by the Committee not later than sixty (60) days (or forty-five (45) days in the event of a claim involving a Disability determination) after receipt of a request for review, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing, in which case a decision will be rendered within a reasonable period of time, but not later than one hundred twenty (120) days (or ninety (90) days in the event of a claim involving a Disability determination) after receipt of a request for review. The decision on review will be in writing and shall include the specific reasons for the denial and the specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based.
 
Walmart, by action of the Committee, reserves the right to amend, suspend or to terminate the Plan in any manner that it deems advisable. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Plan may not be amended, suspended or terminated to cause a Participant to forfeit his or her then-existing Account. In the event of a complete or partial termination of the Plan, the Vested Percentage applicable to the Accounts of the Participants affected by such complete or partial termination shall be one hundred percent (100%), and such Accounts shall be paid at the time and in the manner provided in Article V (subject to the provisions of Article VI). No amendment or termination of the Plan may accelerate the date of payment of a Participant's benefit as provided herein except as permitted by law.
Notwithstanding the preceding, Walmart may, by action of the Committee within the thirty (30) days preceding or twelve (12) months following a change in control (within the meaning of Code Section 409A) of a relevant affiliate, partially terminate the Plan and distribute benefits to all Participants involved in such change in control within twelve (12) months after such action, provided that all plans sponsored by the service recipient immediately after the change in control which are required to be aggregated with this Plan pursuant to Code Section 409A are also terminated and liquidated with respect to each Participant involved in the change in control.
