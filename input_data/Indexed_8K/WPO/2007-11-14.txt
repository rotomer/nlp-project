The Board of Directors of The Washington Post Company (the "Company") amended Article VII of the Company's Bylaws (the "Bylaws"), effective as of November 8, 2007, to allow for the issuance of uncertificated shares, as permitted under Delaware law. With this change to the Bylaws, the Company may now participate in the Direct Registration System, which is currently administered by The Depository Trust Company. The Direct Registration System allows shareholders to have securities registered in their names without the issuance of paper certificates and allows investors to electronically transfer securities to broker-dealers in order to effect transactions without the risks and delays associated with transferring paper certificates.
The full text of the Bylaws, as amended, is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Form 8-K, and amended Article VII thereof is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

(c) The ownership of record of shares of stock by or for the account of Aliens, and the citizenship of transferees thereof, shall be determined in conformity with regulations prescribed by the Board. There shall be maintained separate stock records, a domestic record of shares of stock held by citizens and a foreign record of shares of stock held by Aliens.
(d) Every certificate representing stock issued or transferred to an Alien shall be marked "Foreign Share Certificate," but under no circumstances shall certificates representing more than one-fifth of the aggregate number of shares of voting stock of any class outstanding at any one time be so marked, nor shall the total amount of voting stock represented by Foreign Share Certificates, plus the amount of voting stock owned by or for the account of Aliens and represented by certificates not so marked, exceed one-fifth of the aggregate number of shares of voting stock of any class outstanding. Every certificate issued not marked "Foreign Share Certificate" shall be marked "Domestic Share Certificate." Any stock represented by Foreign Share Certificates may be transferred to either Aliens or non-Aliens.
(e) If, and so long as, the stock records of the Company shall disclose that one-fifth of the outstanding shares of voting stock of any class is owned by Aliens, no transfer of shares of such class represented by Domestic Share Certificates shall be made to Aliens, and if it shall be found by the Company that stock represented by a Domestic Share Certificate is, in fact, held by or for the account of an Alien, the holder of such stock shall not be entitled to vote, to receive dividends or to have any other rights, except the right to transfer such stock to a citizen of the United States of America.
(f) The Company shall not be owned or controlled directly or indirectly by any other corporation of which any officer or more than one-fourth of the directors are Aliens, or of which more than one-fourth of the stock is owned of record or voted by Aliens.
