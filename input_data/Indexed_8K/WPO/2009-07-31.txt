Operating results were also down at the television broadcasting division and were relatively flat at the cable television division, while the education division reported improved results for the quarter in spite of the restructuring charges.
For the first six months of 2009, the Company reported a net loss of $8.1 million ($0.74 per share), compared with net income of $36.7 million ($3.77 per share) for the same period of 2008.

Revenue for the first half of 2009 was $2,182.6 million, up 1% from $2,169.4 million in the first half of 2008, due to increased revenues at the Company's education and cable television divisions, offset by revenue declines at the Company's newspaper publishing, magazine publishing and television broadcasting divisions.

operating loss of $13.4 million for the first half of 2009, compared to operating income of $71.7 million for the first half of 2008. Excluding charges related to early retirement plan buyouts and accelerated depreciation at The Washington Post, the newspaper publishing and magazine publishing divisions reported increased losses in the first six months of 2009, compared to the first six months of 2008. Operating results were also down at the education and television broadcasting divisions, while the cable television division reported improved results for the period.
The Company's operating results for the second quarter and first six months of 2009 included $1.6 million and $2.9 million of net pension credits, respectively, compared to $6.6 million and $13.2 million of net pension credits, respectively, for the same periods of 2008, excluding charges related to early retirement programs.
Divisional Results
Education
Education division revenue totaled $649.3 million for the second quarter of 2009, a 13% increase over revenue of $576.5 million for the same period of 2008. Kaplan reported operating income of $58.1 million for the second quarter of 2009, up 23% from $47.4 million in the second quarter of 2008.
For the first six months of 2009, education division revenue totaled $1,242.9 million, an 11% increase over revenue of $1,119.7 million for the same period of 2008. Kaplan reported operating income of $69.3 million for the first six months of 2009, down 26% from $94.2 million for the first six months of 2008.
A summary of Kaplan's operating results for the second quarter and the first six months of 2009 compared to 2008 is as follows:

Kaplan Higher Education (KHE) includes Kaplan's domestic and international post-secondary education businesses, made up of fixed-facility colleges as well as online post-secondary and career programs. Higher education revenue grew 36% for the second quarter of 2009 and 31% for the first half of 2009 due mostly to strong enrollment growth. Operating income at KHE improved 74% in the second quarter of 2009, reflecting this strong enrollment growth. Operating income increased 31% for the first half of 2009 as the strong enrollment growth was offset by increased marketing and advertising costs in the first quarter of 2009, including a $21.0 million national media campaign. At June 30, 2009, KHE's enrollments totaled 103,300, a 31% increase compared to total enrollments of 78,700 at June 30, 2008. All KHE divisions contributed to the enrollment growth in the first half of 2009, with Kaplan University's online offerings growing the strongest at 45%.
Test prep includes Kaplan's standardized test preparation and English-language course offerings, as well as the K12 and Score businesses. Test prep revenue, excluding Score and revenue from acquired businesses, declined 7% in the second quarter and the first half of 2009 due primarily to declines in English-language, K12 and the traditional test prep programs. Test prep operating income, excluding Score, was down in the first half of 2009 due largely to declines in K12, English-language and the traditional test prep programs.
Score revenues declined 57% in the second quarter of 2009 to $3.6 million and 49% in the first half of 2009 to $8.4 million. Operating losses at Score increased from $1.9 million and $5.6 million in the second quarter and first half of 2008, respectively, to $18.5 million and $36.2 million for the same periods of 2009, inclusive of restructuring-related charges. At the end of March 2009, the Company approved a plan to offer tutoring services, previously provided at Score, in Kaplan test prep centers. The plan was substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of 2009; 14 existing Score centers were converted into Kaplan test prep centers and the remaining 64 Score centers were closed. The Company recorded charges of $24.9 million in asset write-downs, lease terminations, severance and accelerated depreciation of fixed assets in the first half of 2009, including a $9.2 million write-down on Score's software product. Of this amount, $13.4 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2009.
Professional includes domestic and overseas training businesses. Professional revenue declined 16% in the second quarter of 2009 and 15% in the first half of 2009. Excluding revenue from acquired businesses, professional revenue was down 18% for the second quarter of 2009 and 17% in the first six months of 2009. The declines are the result of unfavorable exchange rates in the U.K. and Australia and continued declines in the Kaplan Professional (U.S.) real estate and financial education businesses. These declines were offset by revenue growth at professional's Asian operations. Likewise, professional operating income is down largely due to weakness in professional's real estate and financial education businesses in the U.S. and the U.K., offset by improved operating results at professional's Asian operations.
In 2007, Kaplan announced restructuring plans at Kaplan Professional (U.S.) that involved product changes and decentralization of certain operations, in addition to employee terminations. In the fourth quarter of 2008, Kaplan expanded the Kaplan Professional (U.S.) restructuring to include additional operations. Total restructuring-related expenses of $1.8 million and $7.2 million were recorded in the second quarter and first half of 2009, respectively, related to lease termination, accelerated depreciation of fixed assets and severance

costs, compared to $1.8 million and $3.2 million in restructuring-related severance costs recorded in the second quarter and first half of 2008, respectively.
Corporate represents unallocated expenses of Kaplan, Inc.'s corporate office and other minor activities.
Other includes amortization of certain intangible assets and charges for incentive compensation arising from equity awards under the Kaplan stock option plan. Kaplan recorded stock compensation expense of $1.7 million and $14.0 million in the second quarter of 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $3.5 million and $7.3 million in the first six months of 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to this plan.
Cable Television
Cable television division revenue of $186.7 million for the second quarter of 2009 represents a 4% increase from $178.9 million in the second quarter of 2008; for the first six months of 2009, revenue increased 5% to $370.2 million, from $353.2 million in the same period of 2008. The 2009 revenue increase is due to continued growth in the division's cable modem, telephone and digital revenues, and a $4 monthly rate increase for most basic subscribers in June 2009.
Cable division operating income declined 1% to $39.8 million in the second quarter of 2009, versus $40.1 million in the second quarter of 2008; cable division operating income for the first six months of 2009 increased 10% to $81.8 million, from $74.4 million for the first six months of 2008. The decline in operating income in the second quarter of 2009 is due to increased programming, bad debt and general and administrative costs. The increase in operating income for the first six months of 2009 is due to the division's revenue growth.
At June 30, 2009, Revenue Generating Units (RGUs) grew 2% due to continued growth in high-speed data and telephony subscribers, partially offset by a reduction in basic subscribers. A summary of RGUs is as follows:
 
Newspaper Publishing
Newspaper publishing division revenue totaled $168.8 million for the second quarter of 2009, a decrease of 14% from $197.3 million in the second quarter of 2008; division revenue decreased 18% to $329.7 million for the first six months of 2009, from $403.4 million for the first six months of 2008. Print advertising revenue at The Post in the second quarter of 2009 declined 20% to $80.0 million, from $99.8 million in the second quarter of 2008, and decreased 27% to $154.3 million for the first six months of 2009, from $211.4 million in the same period
 
6
 
of 2008. The print revenue decline in the second quarter of 2009 is due to large decreases in classified, zones and general advertising; the decline in the first half of 2009 includes similar declines. Revenue generated by the Company's newspaper online publishing activities, primarily washingtonpost.com, declined 9% to $23.5 million for the second quarter of 2009, versus $25.9 million for the second quarter of 2008; newspaper online revenues declined 9% to $45.6 million in the first six months of 2009, versus $49.8 million for the first six months of 2008. Display online advertising revenue grew 2% for the second quarter and first six months of 2009. Online classified advertising revenue on washingtonpost.com declined 29% and 26% for the second quarter and first six months of 2009, respectively.
For the first six months of 2009, Post daily and Sunday circulation declined 1.5% and 2.6%, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year. For the six months ended June 28, 2009, average daily circulation at The Post totaled 622,700 and average Sunday circulation totaled 858,100.
As previously announced, the Company offered a Voluntary Retirement Incentive Program to certain employees of The Washington Post newspaper in the first quarter of 2009. A total of 220 employees accepted the offer, and early retirement program expense of $56.8 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2009, which will be funded primarily from the assets of the Company's pension plans. The Company estimates future annual salary and employee benefits savings of approximately $20.0 million in connection with this early retirement program. In the first quarter of 2008, a Voluntary Retirement Incentive Program was also offered, with 231 employees accepting the offer; $79.8 million in early retirement program expense was recorded in the second quarter of 2008, also funded primarily from the assets of the Company's pension plans.
The Post closed its College Park, MD, printing plant in July 2009 and has consolidated its printing operations in Springfield, VA. The Post also intends to consolidate certain other operations in Washington, DC. In connection with these activities, accelerated depreciation of $14.3 million and $27.7 million was recorded in the second quarter and first six months of 2009, respectively; accelerated depreciation of $1.2 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2008. The Company estimates that additional accelerated depreciation of $4.5 million will be recorded for the rest of 2009.
The newspaper division reported an operating loss of $89.3 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared to an operating loss of $96.7 million in the second quarter of 2008. For the first six months of 2009, the newspaper division reported an operating loss of $143.1 million, compared to an operating loss of $95.5 million for the first six months of 2008. Excluding early retirement program charges and accelerated depreciation, operating results declined in the second quarter and first six months of 2009 due to the significant decline in division advertising revenue and increased bad debt expense, offset by expense reductions. Newsprint expense was down 19% and 9% for the second quarter and first six months of 2009, respectively, due to a decline in newsprint consumption and recent newsprint price declines.

A summary of newspaper division operating results for the second quarter and the first six months of 2009 compared to 2008 is as follows:
 
 
Television Broadcasting
Revenue for the television broadcasting division decreased 20% in the second quarter of 2009 to $66.7 million, from $82.8 million in 2008; operating income for the second quarter of 2009 declined 52% to $14.3 million, from $29.7 million in 2008. For the first six months of 2009, revenue decreased 20% to $127.8 million, from $160.5 million in 2008; operating income for the first six months of 2009 declined 53% to $26.4 million, from $56.3 million in 2008. The decrease in revenue and operating income is due to weaker advertising demand in all markets and most product categories, particularly automotive; political advertising revenue also declined by $0.4 million and $3.2 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2009, respectively.
Magazine Publishing
Revenue for the magazine publishing division totaled $45.5 million in the second quarter of 2009, a 27% decrease from $62.7 million in the second quarter of 2008; division revenue totaled $91.6 million for the first six months of 2009, a 21% decrease from $116.1 million in the first six months of 2008. The decline is due to a 40% and 32% reduction in advertising revenue at Newsweek for the second quarter and first six months of 2009, respectively, resulting from fewer ad pages at both the domestic and international editions. In February 2009, Newsweek announced a circulation rate base reduction at its domestic edition, from 2.6 million to 1.5 million, by January 2010.
As previously announced, Newsweek offered a Voluntary Retirement Incentive Program to certain employees in November 2008 and 44 employees accepted the offer in the first quarter of 2009; early retirement program expense of $6.6 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2009, which is being funded primarily from the assets of the Company's pension plans. In the first quarter of 2008, Newsweek also offered a Voluntary Retirement Incentive Program to certain employees and 117 employees accepted the offer. The early retirement program expense in 2008 totaled $29.2 million, which is being funded mostly from the assets
 
8
 
of the Company's pension plans. Of this amount, $24.6 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2008 and $4.6 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2008.
The division had an operating loss of $5.0 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared to an operating loss of $3.7 million in the second quarter of 2008; the division had an operating loss of $25.4 million for the first six months of 2009, compared to an operating loss of $36.0 million for the first six months of 2008. Excluding early retirement program expense, the division's operating loss increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2009 due to the revenue reductions discussed above, offset by a decline in subscription and editorial expenses at the domestic edition of Newsweek.
Other Businesses and Corporate Office
Other businesses and corporate office included the expenses of the Company's corporate office and the operating results of Avenue100 Media Solutions (formerly CourseAdvisor). In the second quarter of 2008, the corporate office recorded $3.0 million in early retirement program expense.
Equity in (Losses) Earnings of Affiliates
The Company's equity in losses of affiliates for the second quarter of 2009 was $0.2 million, compared to losses of $5.7 million for the second quarter of 2008. For the first six months of 2009, the Company's equity in losses of affiliates totaled $1.0 million, compared to losses of $8.9 million for the same period of 2008. Results for the second quarter of 2008 included $6.8 million in impairment charges at two of the Company's affiliates.
The Company holds a 49% interest in Bowater Mersey Paper Company and interests in several other affiliates.
Other Non-Operating Income (Expense)
The Company recorded other non-operating income, net, of $19.7 million for the second quarter of 2009, compared to other non-operating income, net, of $2.9 million for the second quarter of 2008. The second quarter 2009 non-operating income, net, included $19.8 million in unrealized foreign currency gains. The second quarter 2008 non-operating income, net, included $2.9 million in unrealized foreign currency gains.
The Company recorded other non-operating income, net, of $15.7 million for the first six months of 2009, compared to other non-operating income, net, of $7.0 million for the same period of the prior year. The 2009 non-operating income, net, included $18.4 million in unrealized foreign currency gains, offset by $2.9 million in impairment write-downs on cost method investments and other items. The 2008 non-operating income, net, included $7.3 million in unrealized foreign currency gains.
As noted above, a large part of the Company's non-operating income (expense) is from unrealized foreign currency gains arising from the translation of British pound and Australian
 
9
 
dollar-denominated intercompany loans into U.S. dollars. The unrealized foreign currency gains in the first half of 2009 and 2008 were the result of a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and the Australian dollar in the first half of 2009 and 2008, versus the exchange rates in effect at the end of 2008 and 2007.
Net Interest Expense
The Company incurred net interest expense of $7.2 million and $14.3 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2009, respectively, compared to $4.8 million and $9.3 million for the same periods of 2008. The increases are due to a decline in interest income, as well as higher average interest rates in the first half of 2009 versus the same period of the prior year. At June 28, 2009, the Company had $399.1 million in borrowings outstanding at an average interest rate of 7.2%.
(Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes

In the first quarter of 2009, the Company repurchased 3,359 shares of its Class B common stock at a cost of $1.4 million from recipients of vested awards of restricted shares at market price.
