To the extent that the claim with respect to which an indemnity obligation arises and has been satisfied has not given rise to an actual net Tax benefit in a prior year or in the year in which the indemnity payment is to be made, but gives rise to an actual net Tax benefit with respect to the Indemnified Party in a later year, the Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such Tax benefit, but not in excess of the amount paid to or for the benefit of the Indemnified Party by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss.

Exhibit 99.1
On September 30, 2010, The Washington Post Company ("the Company") completed the sale of Newsweek magazine to Harman Media, LLC and Dr. Sidney Harman. Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, the buyer assumed Newsweek's subscription obligations and received Newsweek's intellectual property, target working capital and selected equipment used in the business. The Company retained the pension assets and liabilities and certain employee obligations, including severance, and other liabilities arising prior to the sale.
The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet presents the Company's financial position assuming the sale of Newsweek magazine occurred on July 4, 2010.
The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of income present the Company's results of operations for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 3, 2010 assuming the sale of Newsweek magazine occurred on January 1, 2007. The Company reported the disposition of Newsweek magazine as a discontinued operation in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 205, "Presentation of Financial Statements" ("ASC 205") for the twenty six weeks ended July 4, 2010 and June 28, 2009 in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended July 4, 2010, and therefore the Company did not include the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of income for these periods in this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared using assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances and are intended for informational purposes only. They are not necessarily indicative of the financial results that would have occurred if the transactions described herein had taken place on the dates indicated, nor are they indicative of the future consolidated results of the Company. However, management believes that the estimates and assumptions used provide a reasonable basis for presenting the significant effects of the sale of Newsweek magazine. Management also believes the pro forma adjustments give appropriate effect to the estimates and assumptions and are applied in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of July 4, 2010 and the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of income for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 3, 2010 should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements of the Company for the twenty six weeks ended July 4, 2010 (unaudited) and for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 3, 2010 (audited), including the related notes, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, respectively, on Form 10-Q on August 11, 2010 and on Form 10-K on March 2, 2010.
The following is a brief description of the amounts recorded under each of the column headings in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet and the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income:
