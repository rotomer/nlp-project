Explanatory Note
This Current Report on Form 8-K/A amends and supplements the Current Report on Form 8-K of The Washington Post Company (the "Company"), originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 16, 2011 (the "Initial Filing"). The sole purpose for filing this Form 8-K/A is to disclose the Company's determination with respect to the frequency of future shareholder non-binding advisory votes on the executive compensation of the Company. No other changes have been made to the Initial Filing.
Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
On May 16, 2011, the Company reported in its Initial Filing that a majority of Class A shareholders entitled to vote at the 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders had voted to recommend, on a non-binding advisory basis, an annual frequency for future shareholder votes on the executive compensation of the Company.
On June 9, 2011, the Company's Board of Directors determined that the Company will hold future shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation on an annual basis until the next vote on the frequency of such votes is conducted or until the Board of Directors determines that a different frequency for such votes is in the best interests of the shareholders of the Company.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
