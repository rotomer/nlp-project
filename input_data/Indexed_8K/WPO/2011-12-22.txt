Section 5  Corporate Governance and Management
 
On December 22, 2011, the executive committee of the board of directors of The Washington Post Company (the "Company"), pursuant to a delegation of authority from the board of directors, approved a change in the Company's fiscal year from a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to December 31 to a quarterly month end, with the new fiscal year ending on December 31 of each year. The Company's 2011 fiscal year will end on December 31, 2011. This change is not deemed a change in fiscal year for purposes of reporting subject to Rule 13a-10 or Rule 15d-10 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as the new fiscal year commences within seven days of the prior fiscal year end and the new fiscal year commences with the end of the prior fiscal year. As a result, the Company will not be filing a transition report and will include the one-day transition period of January 1, 2012 with the first quarter of 2012.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
