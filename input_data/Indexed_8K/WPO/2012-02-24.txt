WASHINGTON  The Washington Post Company (NYSE: WPO) today reported net income attributable to common shares of $116.2 million ($14.70 per share) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, compared to net income attributable to common shares of $277.2 million ($31.04 per share) for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2011.

(Non-GAAP measures are discussed below).
 
Excluding these items, the Companys net income attributable to common shares was $68.9 million ($8.96 per share) for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2011, compared to net income attributable to common shares of $97.2 million ($11.59 per share) for the fourth quarter of last year.

(Non-GAAP measures are discussed below).

For the fourth quarter of 2011, revenue was $1,063.4 million, down 10% from $1,182.2 million in 2010.

Revenues and operating results were down at the education, newspaper publishing and television broadcasting divisions, while revenues were flat and operating income improved at the cable television division.
 
 
Division Results
 
Education
 
Education division revenue in 2011 totaled $2,465.0 million, a 14% decline from revenue of $2,862.3 million in 2010.  Excluding revenue from acquired businesses, education division revenue declined 16% in 2011.  For the fourth quarter of 2011, education division revenue totaled $597.7 million, a 14% decline from revenue of $691.9 million for the same period of 2010.  Excluding revenue from acquired businesses, education division revenue declined 16% in the fourth quarter of 2011.
 
Kaplan reported operating income of $89.4 million for 2011, down from $346.7 million in 2010; operating income for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $32.3 million, down from $66.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
 
In light of recent revenue declines and other business challenges, Kaplan has formulated and implemented restructuring plans at its various businesses that have resulted in significant costs in 2010 and 2011, with the objective of establishing lower cost levels in future periods.  Across all businesses, severance and restructuring costs totaled $29.2 million in 2011 and $27.5 million in 2010.  Severance and restructuring costs totaled $9.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $19.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
 
 
 
 
A summary of Kaplans operating results for 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to 2010 is as follows (in thousands):
 
 
Kaplan sold Kaplan Compliance Solutions in October 2011, Kaplan Virtual Education in July 2011 and Education Connection in April 2010.  Consequently, the education divisions operating results exclude these businesses.
 
Kaplan Higher Education (KHE) includes Kaplans domestic postsecondary education businesses, made up of fixed
-facility colleges and online postsecondary and career programs.  KHE also includes the Kaplan University School of Professional and Continuing Education.  In 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2011, KHE revenue declined 27% and 26%, respectively, due to declines in average enrollments.  Operating income decreased 63% and 60% for 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2011, respectively.  These declines were due to lower revenue, increased regulatory compliance costs and $13.2 million and $6.1 million in severance and restructuring costs in 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2011, respectively.  Offsetting the declines were lower advertising costs, other expense reductions associated with lower enrollments, incentive compensation credits recorded in 2011 related to amounts previously accrued and $9.3 million in fourth quarter 2010 severance costs.
 
KHE has implemented a number of marketing and admissions changes to increase student selectivity and help KHE comply with recent regulations.  KHE also implemented the Kaplan Commitment program, which provides first-time students with a risk-free trial period.  Under the program, KHE also monitors academic progress and conducts academic assessments to help determine whether students are likely to be successful in their chosen course of study.  Students who withdraw or are subject to academic dismissal during the risk-free trial period do not incur any significant financial obligation.  These changes, along with generally lower demand, have resulted in a 37% decline in new enrollments for 2011 as a whole, in comparison to 2010; however, new enrollments increased 3% in the fourth quarter of 2011.  Management estimates that without the Kaplan Commitment, the decline for 2011 would have been approximately 20%.  Management also estimates that revenue for 2011 would have been approximately $63 million higher if the Kaplan Commitment had not been implemented.  KHE does not recognize tuition revenue for students during the risk-free period. 
 
Student enrollments at December 31, 2011, excluding the
School of Professional and Continuing Education,
were down 23% compared to December 31, 2010, and down 6% compared to September 30, 2011, as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
Kaplan University enrollments included 5,799, 6,036 and 7,426 campus-based students as of December 31, 2011, September 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively.
 
Kaplan University and KHE Campuses enrollments at December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010, by degree and certificate programs, are as follows:
 
 
Test Preparation includes Kaplans standardized test preparation and tutoring offerings and other businesses.  In the first quarter of 2010, the Company discontinued certain offerings of the K12 business; $7.8 million in severance and other closure costs were recorded in the first half of 2010 in connection with this plan.  In the fourth quarter of 2010,
Kaplan Test Preparation began implementing a plan to reorganize its business consistent with the migration of students to Kaplans online and hybrid test preparation offerings, reducing the number of leased test preparation centers; $10.4 million in costs were incurred, mostly comprised of charges related to early lease termination and property, plant and equipment write-downs.  In 2011, implementation of the plan was completed and $12.5 million in additional restructuring and severance costs were incurred ($0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2011). 
 
Test Preparation revenue declined 4% in 2011 and 11% in the fourth quarter of 2011.  Higher enrollment, particularly in the health and bar review programs, was offset by reduced prices for many programs due to increased competition and a shift in demand to lower priced online test preparation offerings. Test Preparation operating results improved in 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2011, due to a $5.7 million and $9.9 million decline in restructuring costs, respectively, and lower operating expenses, offset by revenue reductions.
 
Kaplan International includes professional training and postsecondary education businesses outside the United States, as well as English-language programs.  In May 2011, Kaplan Australia acquired Franklyn Scholar and Carrick Education Group, leading national providers of vocational training and higher education in Australia.  In June 2011, Kaplan acquired Structuralia, a provider of e-learning for the engineering and infrastructure sector in Spain.  Kaplan International revenue increased 18% in 2011.  Excluding revenue from acquired businesses, Kaplan International revenue increased 10% in 2011 due to favorable exchange rates and enrollment growth in the pathways and English-language programs.  Kaplan International revenue increased 14% in the fourth quarter of 2011.  Excluding revenue from acquired businesses, Kaplan International revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2011 due to enrollment growth in the pathways and English-language programs.  Kaplan International operating income declined in 2011 due to overall losses from newly acquired businesses, as well as up-front spending for admission and occupancy at its Asian and United Kingdom businesses to support expanding operations.  In addition, Kaplan International operating income decreased due to enrollment declines at its UK professional training schools arising from new pending student visa restrictions. 
 
Kaplan Ventures is made up of several businesses in various stages of development that are managed separately from the other education businesses.  Revenue at Kaplan Ventures increased 26% and 20% in 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2011, respectively.  Kaplan Ventures reported an operating loss of $10.1 million and operating income of $1.1 million in 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2011, respectively, compared to operating losses of $17.5 million and $3.5 million in 2010 and the fourth quarter of 2010, respectively.  Kaplan Ventures sold one small business in February 2012 and is exploring other alternatives with respect to the remaining Kaplan Ventures businesses, including possible sales. 
 
Corporate represents unallocated expenses of Kaplan, Inc.s corporate office and other minor shared activities.  Corporate results decreased slightly in 2011.  Corporate expenses in the fourth quarter of 2010 were offset by the reversal of incentive compensation accruals.
 
 
 
 
Cable Television
 
Cable television division revenue for 2011 increased slightly to $760.2 million, from $759.9 million in 2010; revenue totaled $190.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, a small decline from $191.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.  The revenue results reflect continued growth of the divisions Internet and telephone service revenues, offset by an increase in promotional discounts and a decline in basic video subscribers. 
 
Cable television division operating income in 2011 decreased to $156.8 million, from $163.9 million in 2010; operating income for the fourth quarter of 2011 increased to $41.9 million, from $37.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.  The cable television divisions operating income for 2011 declined primarily due to increased programming, technical and sales costs.  The divisions operating income for the fourth quarter of 2011 increased primarily due to a reduction in telephony and general and administrative expenses, offset by increased programming costs.
 
At December 31, 2011, Primary Service Units (PSUs) were up 2% from the prior year due to growth in high-speed data and telephony subscribers, offset by a decrease in basic video subscribers.  A summary of PSUs is as follows:
 
 
 
Newspaper Publishing
 
Newspaper publishing division revenue in 2011 declined 5% to $648.0 million, from $680.4 million in 2010; revenue totaled $181.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, a 4% decrease from $188.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.  Print advertising revenue at The Washington Post in 2011 declined 11% to $264.5 million, from $297.9 million in 2010, and decreased 6% to $77.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, from $82.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.  The decline is largely due to reductions in classified, zoned and general advertising.  Revenue generated by the Companys newspaper online publishing activities, primarily washingtonpost.com and Slate, decreased 8% to $105.8 million, from $114.8 million in 2010; revenue decreased 12% to $31.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, versus $35.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.  Display online advertising revenue declined 11% in 2011, and 15% for the fourth quarter of 2011.  Online classified advertising revenue decreased 2% in 2011 and 5% for the fourth quarter of 2011.  The revenue declines from print advertising and newspaper online publishing activities were partially offset by increased revenue from new lines of business in 2011.    
 
Daily circulation at The Washington Post declined 6.3%, and Sunday circulation declined 4.0% in 2011.  For 2011, average daily circulation at The Washington Post totaled 516,200 and average Sunday circulation totaled 732,300.    
 
The newspaper publishing division reported an operating loss of $18.2 million in 2011, compared to an operating loss of $9.8 million in 2010.  For the fourth quarter of 2011, the newspaper division reported operating income of $7.4 million, compared to operating income of $19.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.  As previously disclosed, The Herald reported a $2.4 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2011 in connection with its withdrawal from the CWA-ITU Negotiated Pension Plan (CWA-ITU Plan); in 2010, The Washington Post recorded a $20.4 million charge in connection with its withdrawal from the CWA-ITU Plan.  Excluding these charges and a $3.1 million loss recorded on an office lease in the first quarter of 2010, operating results declined in 2011 due to the revenue reductions discussed above, offset by a small decrease in overall costs.  Newsprint expense was down 7% in 2011 and 8% in the fourth quarter of 2011, respectively, due to a decline in newsprint consumption.
 
 
 
 
Television Broadcasting
 
Revenue for the television broadcasting division declined 7% to $319.2 million in 2011, from $342.2 million in 2010; for the fourth quarter of 2011, revenue declined 14% to $88.3 million, from $102.9 million in 2010.  Television broadcasting division operating income for 2011 declined 4% to $117.1 million, from $121.3 million in 2010.  For the fourth quarter of 2011, operating income declined 10% to $40.9 million, from $45.3 million in 2010. 
 
The decline in revenue is due primarily to the absence of $4.7 million in incremental winter Olympics-related advertising in the first quarter of 2010 and a $32.8 million and $18.9 million decrease in political advertising revenue for 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2011, respectively.  For 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2011, operating results declined as a result of revenue reductions discussed above, offset by expense reductions from various cost control initiatives. 
 
 
Other Businesses
 
Other businesses includes the operating results of Avenue100 Media Solutions, the Companys digital marketing business that sources leads for academic institutions and recruiting organizations, and other small businesses. 
 
In 2011, revenues declined substantially due to volume declines as a result of changes implemented at Avenue100 Media Solutions to improve lead quality.  Goodwill and other intangible assets impairment charges of $11.9 million and $27.5 million were recorded at Avenue100 Media Solutions in 2011 and 2010, respectively.  Excluding these charges, operating losses increased in 2011 due to the revenue declines discussed above and increased costs at other small businesses.
 
 
Corporate Office
 
Corporate office includes the expenses of the Companys corporate office as well as the pension credit previously reported in the magazine publishing division (refer to Discontinued Operations discussion below).
 
In the fourth quarter of 2010, certain Kaplan operations moved to the former Newsweek headquarters facility.  In connection with this move, $11.5 million in lease termination and other charges were recorded by the corporate office in the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
 
Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Affiliates
 
The Company holds a 49% interest in Bowater Mersey Paper Company, a 16.5% interest in Classified Ventures, LLC, and interests in several other affiliates.  The Companys equity in earnings of affiliates for 2011 was $5.9 million, compared with losses of $4.1 million in 2010.  For the fourth quarter of 2011, the Companys equity in earnings of affiliates totaled $0.6 million, compared to losses of $0.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.  The results for 2011 reflect improved earnings at the Companys Classified Ventures affiliate and other affiliates, offset by a $9.2 million impairment charge recorded in 2011 on the Companys interest in Bowater Mersey Paper Company.
 
 
Other Non-Operating (Expense) Income
 
The Company recorded other non-operating expense, net, of $55.2 million in 2011, compared to other non-operating income, net, of $7.5 million in 2010.  For the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company recorded other non-operating income, net, of $1.1 million, compared to other non-operating income, net, of $2.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
The 2011 non-operating expense, net, included a $53.8 million write-down of a marketable equity security (Corinthian Colleges, Inc.), $3.3 million in unrealized foreign currency losses ($0.4 million in unrealized foreign currency gains in the fourth quarter) and other items.  The 2010 non-operating income, net, included $6.7 million in unrealized foreign currency gains ($1.9 million in unrealized foreign currency gains in the fourth quarter).
 
 
 
 
Net Interest Expense
 
The Company incurred net interest expense of $29.1 million in 2011, compared to $27.9 million in 2010; net interest expense totaled $7.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, versus $6.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.  At December 31, 2011, the Company had $565.2 million in borrowings outstanding at an average interest rate of 5.7%; at January 2, 2011, the Company had $399.7 million in borrowings outstanding at an average interest rate of 7.2%.
 
 
Provision for Income Taxes
 
The effective tax rate for income from continuing operations in 2011 was 44.2%.  This effective tax rate was adversely impacted by $17.8 million in valuation allowances provided against deferred income tax benefits where realization is doubtful, and $4.5 million from nondeductible goodwill in connection with an impairment charge recorded in 2011.  The effective tax rate benefited from lower rates at jurisdictions outside the United States.     
 
The effective tax rate for income from continuing operations in 2010 was 40.5%.  This effective tax rate was adversely impacted by $16.8 million in valuation allowances provided against deferred income tax benefits where realization is doubtful, and $9.1 million from nondeductible goodwill in connection with an impairment charge recorded in 2010; these items were offset by permanent U.S. Federal tax benefit items and tax benefits from lower rates at jurisdictions outside the United States. 
 
 
Discontinued Operations
 
On September 30, 2010, the Company completed the sale of Newsweek.  In addition, Kaplan sold Kaplan Compliance Solutions in October 2011, Kaplan Virtual Education in July 2011 and Education Connection in April 2010.  Consequently, the Companys income from continuing operations excludes these businesses, which have been reclassified to discontinued operations, net of tax.
 
 
Earnings (Loss) Per Share
 
The calculation of diluted earnings per share for 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2011 were based on 7,904,983 and 7,681,799 weighted average shares, respectively, compared to 8,930,608,and 8,384,755 weighted average shares, respectively, for 2010 and the fourth quarter of 2010.  In 2011, the Company repurchased 644,948 shares of its Class B common stock at a cost of $248.0 million.  On September 8, 2011, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to acquire up to 750,000 shares of its Class B common stock.  The Company did not announce a ceiling price or a time limit for the purchases, and the authorization included 43,573 shares that remained under the previous authorization.  At December 31, 2011, there were 7,591,000 shares outstanding and the Company had remaining authorization from the Board of Directors to purchase up to 493,474 shares of Class B common stock.
