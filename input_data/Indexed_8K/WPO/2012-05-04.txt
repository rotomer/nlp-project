WASHINGTON  The Washington Post Company (NYSE: WPO) today reported net income attributable to common shares of $31.0 million ($4.07 per share) for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012, compared to $15.2 million ($1.87 per share) for the first quarter of last year. Net income includes $20.2 million ($2.70 per share) in income from discontinued operations and $2.8 million ($0.34 per share) in losses from discontinued operations for the first quarter of 2012 and 2011, respectively. Income from continuing operations attributable to common shares was $10.8 million ($1.37 per share) for the first quarter of 2012, compared to $17.9 million ($2.21 per share) for the first quarter of 2011. As a result of the Companys share repurchases, there were 6% fewer diluted average shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2012.  
 
Items included in the Companys income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2012:
$1.9 million in severance and early retirement charges at the newspaper publishing division (after-tax impact of $1.2 million, or $0.16 per share);
a $5.8 million gain on sales of cost method investments (after-tax impact of $3.7 million, or $0.48 per share); and
$2.7 million in non-operating unrealized foreign currency gains (after-tax impact of $1.7 million, or $0.22 per share).
                                          
Items included in the Companys income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2011:
$2.3 million in severance and restructuring charges at Kaplan (after-tax impact of $1.4 million, or $0.18 per share);
a $3.8 million gain on the sale of a cost method investment (after-tax impact of $2.4 million, or $0.29 per share);
a $30.7 million write-down of a marketable equity security (after-tax impact of $19.8 million, or $2.44 per share); and
$2.7 million in non-operating unrealized foreign currency gains (after-tax impact of $1.7 million, or $0.21 per share).
Excluding these items, the Companys net income attributable to common shares was $26.9 million ($3.53 per share) for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012, compared to net income attributable to common shares of $32.3 million ($3.99 per share) for the first quarter of last year. Excluding these items, income from continuing operations attributable to common shares was $6.7 million ($0.83 per share) for the first
quarter of 2012, compared to income of $35.0 million ($4.33 per share) for the first quarter of 2011. (Non-GAAP measures are discussed below). 
 
Revenue for the first quarter of 2012 was $972.5 million, down 7% from $1,041.9 million in the first quarter of 2011. The Company reported operating income of $17.5 million in the first quarter of 2012, compared to operating income of $56.6 million in the first quarter of 2011. Revenues were down at the education and newspaper publishing divisions and flat at the cable television division, offset by an increase at the television broadcasting division. Operating results were down at all of the Companys divisions, except for the television broadcasting division.
 
 
 
Division Results
Education
 
Education division revenue totaled $553.4 million for the first quarter of 2012, an 11% decline from revenue of $618.9 million for the first quarter of 2011. Excluding revenue from acquired businesses, education division revenue declined 13% in the first quarter of 2012. Kaplan reported a first quarter 2012 operating loss of $13.2 million, compared to operating income of $20.0 million in the first quarter of 2011.
 
A summary of Kaplans first quarter 2012 operating results compared to 2011 is as follows:
 
 
Kaplan sold Kaplan Learning Technologies in February 2012 and EduNeering in April 2012.  Consequently, the education divisions operating results exclude these businesses. Also, Kaplans Colloquy and U.S. Pathways business moved from Kaplan Ventures to Kaplan International. The comparative division results presented above reflect this change. 
 
Kaplan Higher Education (KHE) includes Kaplans domestic postsecondary education businesses, made up of fixed
-facility colleges and online postsecondary and career programs. KHE also includes the domestic professional training and other continuing education businesses. In the first quarter of 2012, KHE revenue declined 20% due to a decline in average enrollments, reflecting weaker market demand over the past year. Operating income decreased 82% due primarily to lower revenue, offset by expense reductions associated with lower enrollments and recent restructuring efforts.
 
Although revenues were down substantially compared to the first quarter of 2011, new student enrollments at Kaplan University and Kaplan Higher Education Campuses increased 5% in the first quarter of 2012.
Student enrollments at March 31, 2012 were down 18% compared to March 31, 2011, but increased 2% compared to December 31, 2011, as follows:
 
Kaplan University enrollments included 5,979, 5,799 and 7,928 campus-based students as of March 31, 2012, December 31, 2011, and March 31, 2011, respectively.
 
 
 
 
Kaplan University and KHE Campuses enrollments at March 31, 2012, and March 31, 2011, by degree and certificate programs, are as follows:
 
Kaplan Test Preparation (KTP) includes Kaplans standardized test preparation and tutoring offerings and other businesses. KTP revenue declined 14% in the first quarter of 2012. Enrollment increases of 11%, driven by strength in the medical and bar review programs, were offset by competitive pricing pressure and a shift in demand to lower priced online test preparation offerings. Revenues also declined from the prior year as changes in certain programs and the mix of courses resulted in an increase in average course length and related revenue recognition periods. Total sales bookings at KTP during the first quarter of 2012 were down 2% compared to the first quarter of 2011. KTP operating results reflected lower operating expenses in the first quarter of 2012 due to recent restructuring activities. The first quarter of 2011 also included $2.3 million in restructuring costs.
 
Kaplan International includes professional training and postsecondary education businesses outside the United States and English-language programs. In May 2011, Kaplan Australia acquired Franklyn Scholar and Carrick Education Group, national providers of vocational training and higher education in Australia. In June 2011, Kaplan acquired Structuralia, a provider of e-learning for the engineering and infrastructure sector in Spain. Kaplan International revenue increased 16% in 2012. Excluding revenue from acquired businesses, Kaplan International revenue increased 6% in the first quarter of 2012 due largely to enrollment growth in the English-language and Singapore higher education programs. Kaplan International operating income increased in the first quarter of 2012 due to strong results in Singapore and the English-language programs, offset by a combined loss from businesses acquired in 2011. 
 
Most of the businesses previously included in Kaplan Ventures have been sold or moved to other Kaplan divisions. Kaplan Ventures is exploring other alternatives with respect to its remaining businesses, including possible sales. 
 
Corporate represents unallocated expenses of Kaplan, Inc.s corporate office and other minor shared activities. 
 
Cable Television
 
Cable television division revenue for the first quarter of 2012 was $190.2 million, flat compared to $190.3 million for the first quarter of 2011. The revenue results reflect continued growth of the divisions internet and telephone service revenues, offset by an increase in promotional discounts and a decline in basic video subscribers. 
 
Cable television division operating income decreased 13% to $32.8 million, from $37.7 million in the first quarter of 2011. The divisions operating income declined primarily due to increased programming and sales costs.
 
At March 31, 2012, Primary Service Units (PSUs) were up 1% from the prior year due to growth in high-speed data and telephony subscribers, offset by a decrease in basic video subscribers. A summary of PSUs is as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
Newspaper Publishing
 
Newspaper publishing division revenue totaled $142.3 million for the first quarter of 2012, down 8% from revenue of $155.0 million for the first quarter of 2011. Print advertising revenue at The Washington Post (the Post) in the first quarter of 2012 declined 17% to $52.7 million, from $63.2 million in the first quarter of 2011. The decline is largely due to reductions in general, classified and preprint advertising. Revenue generated by the Companys newspaper online publishing activities, primarily washingtonpost.com and Slate, decreased 7% to $24.2 million for the first quarter of 2012, versus $26.2 million for the first quarter of 2011. Display online advertising revenue declined 11% for the first quarter of 2012. Online classified advertising revenue on washingtonpost.com decreased 1% for the first quarter of 2012.  
 
For the first quarter of 2012, daily and Sunday circulation at the Post declined 9.8% and 5.2%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2011. For the first quarter of 2012, average daily circulation at the Post totaled 492,600, and average Sunday circulation totaled 714,600.    
  
The newspaper division reported an operating loss of $22.6 million in the first quarter of 2012, compared to an operating loss of $12.8 million in the first quarter of 2011. These operating losses include noncash pension expense of $8.6 million and $6.7 million for the first quarter of 2012 and 2011, respectively. The decline in operating results is primarily due to the revenue reductions discussed above and $1.9 million in severance and early retirement expenses, offset partially by a reduction in other operating expenses. Newsprint expense was down 11% for the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2011, due to a decline in newsprint consumption.
 
Television Broadcasting
 
Revenue for the television broadcasting division increased 13% in the first quarter of 2012 to $81.5 million, from $72.2 million in 2011; operating income for the first quarter of 2012 increased 58% to $31.0 million, from $19.6 million in 2011. The increase in revenue and operating income reflects improved advertising demand across many product categories, including a $2.2 million increase in political advertising revenue. Expense reductions from various cost control initiatives also contributed to the improvement in operating results.
 
Other Businesses
 
Other businesses includes the operating results of Avenue100 Media Solutions, the Companys digital marketing business that sources leads for academic institutions and recruiting organizations, and other small businesses.
 
Corporate Office
 
Corporate office includes the expenses of the Companys corporate office as well as a net pension credit.
 
Equity in Earnings of Affiliates, Net
 
The Company holds a 49% interest in Bowater Mersey Paper Company, a 16.5% interest in Classified Ventures, LLC and interests in several other affiliates.
 
The Companys equity in earnings of affiliates, net, for the first quarter of 2012 was $3.9 million, compared to $3.7 million for the first quarter of 2011. 
 
Other Non-Operating Income (Expense)
 
The Company recorded other non-operating income, net, of $8.6 million for the first quarter of 2012, compared to other non-operating expense, net, of $24.0 million for the first quarter of 2011. The first quarter 2012 non-operating income, net, included a $5.8 million gain on sales of cost method investments, $2.7 million in unrealized foreign currency gains and other items. 
 
The first quarter 2011 non-operating expense, net, included a $30.7 million write-down of a marketable equity security (Corinthian Colleges, Inc.), offset by a $3.8 million gain on the sale of a cost method investment, $2.7 million in unrealized foreign currency gains and other items.
 
 
 
 
Net Interest Expense
 
The Company incurred net interest expense of $8.1 million for the first quarter of 2012, compared to $7.0 million for the first quarter of 2011. At March 31, 2012, the Company had $456.4 million in borrowings outstanding at an average interest rate of 7.0%.
 
Provision for Income Taxes
 
The effective tax rate for income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2012 was 48.1%, compared to 37.2% for the first quarter of 2011. The higher effective tax rate in 2012 results primarily from losses in Australia for which no tax benefit is recorded.   
 
Discontinued Operations
 
Kaplan sold EduNeering in April 2012, Kaplan Learning Technologies in February 2012, Kaplan Compliance Solutions in October 2011 and Kaplan Virtual Education in July 2011. Consequently, the Companys income from continuing operations excludes these businesses, which have been reclassified to discontinued operations, net of tax.
 
The sale of Kaplan Learning Technologies resulted in a pre-tax loss of $3.1 million that was recorded in the first quarter of 2012. The sale of EduNeering resulted in an estimated pre-tax gain of $30 million, which will be recorded in the second quarter of 2012.
 
In connection with each of the sales of the Companys stock in EduNeering and Kaplan Learning Technologies, in the first quarter of 2012, the Company recorded $23.2 million of income tax benefits related to the excess of the outside stock tax basis over the net book value of the net assets disposed.
 
Earnings (Loss) Per Share
 
The calculation of diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2012 was based on 7,614,623 weighted average shares outstanding, compared to 8,119,373 for the first quarter of 2011. At March 31, 2012, there were 7,617,409 shares outstanding and the Company had remaining authorization from the Board of Directors to purchase up to 493,074 shares of Class B common stock.
