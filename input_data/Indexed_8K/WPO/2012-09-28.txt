Item 8.01  Other Events
 
On September 27, 2012, Kaplan Higher Education (KHE) finalized a plan (the Plan) to consolidate its market presence at certain of its fixed-facility campuses.  Under the Plan, KHE has ceased new enrollments at nine ground campuses as it considers alternatives for these locations, and will consolidate operations of four other campuses into existing, nearby locations.  KHE will be teaching out the current students at these campuses.
 
Revenues at these campuses represent approximately 4% of KHEs total revenues and 2% of Kaplan, Inc.s total revenues for the first six months of 2012.  In connection with the Plan, KHE expects to incur an estimated $18 million in restructuring costs from fixed asset write-downs and lease and severance obligations; a portion of these restructuring costs will be recorded in the third quarter of 2012, with the remainder recorded through the end of 2013.
