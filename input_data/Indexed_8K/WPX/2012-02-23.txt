Exhibit 99.1
 
Feb. 23, 2012
DATE:
 
TULSA, Okla.  WPX Energy (NYSE:WPX) today announced its unaudited financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and the year-ended Dec. 31, 2011. Highlights for the year include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
2011 FINANCIAL RESULTS
WPX results for the year-ended Dec. 31, 2011, were impacted by non-cash impairment charges during the fourth quarter primarily due to a decline in forward natural gas prices.
Including these non-cash charges, WPX reported an unaudited net loss attributable to WPX Energy of $302 million in 2011, or a loss of $1.53 per share on a diluted basis. This compares with a net loss of $1,291 million, or a loss of $6.55 per share, on a diluted basis for 2010.
WPX's adjusted EBITDAX was $1,330 million in 2011  essentially equal to 2010. Adjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP measure. It is not a measure of net income or cash flows as determined by U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDAX to net income (loss) is included in this announcement, as well as a definition.
The 2011 pre-tax, non-cash charges of approximately $547 million related to certain proved and unproved natural gas properties, primarily in the Powder River Basin and Barnett Shale.
WPX also reported $61 million in non-cash charges for dry-hole and leasehold write offs during third-quarter 2011 associated with an unsuccessful exploratory well in Columbia County, Pa., and associated acreage.
Results in 2010 were impacted by non-cash impairment charges of approximately $1 billion to goodwill and $678 million related to certain proved and unproved natural gas properties, primarily in the Barnett Shale.
For the fourth quarter of 2011, WPX reported an unaudited net loss of $338 million, or a loss of $1.72 per share on a diluted basis, compared with net income $12 million, or $0.06 per share on a diluted basis, for the fourth quarter of 2010.
MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE
"Our oil and NGL production and revenues reached an all-time high, reflecting our emphasis on the development of our assets in the Bakken Shale and the liquids-rich Piceance Basin," CEO Ralph Hill said.
"And as we've announced, we're decreasing our natural gas drilling in this commodity environment in favor of pursuing opportunities to grow our oil and NGL production even more.
"Currently, our Bakken Shale development has the highest incremental returns of any of our drilling programs.
"Overall, our operations, balance sheet, cash, liquidity and cash flow place us in a position of strength for 2012," Hill added.
PRODUCTION
The company's overall domestic and international production climbed nearly 10 percent in 2011 to an average of 1,399 MMcfe/d, excluding production attributable to discontinued operations in the Arkoma Basin.
The production increase was led by advances in oil and NGL production, which jumped 65 percent and 25 percent respectively in 2011.
Oil production in the company's highest rate-of-return basin  the Bakken Shale  increased to approximately 6,400 barrels per day in the fourth quarter, which is more than triple first-quarter 2011 production of approximately 1,700 barrels per day. As of mid-February 2012, WPX's oil production from the Bakken increased to 7,600 barrels per day.
NGL production in the liquids-rich Piceance Basin saw a notable increase as well, up 24 percent overall for the full year. In 2011, NGL production averaged 27.1 Mbbl/d, compared with 21.9 Mbbl/d in 2010.
Natural gas production in the Marcellus Shale rose significantly in late 2011 following the delayed startup of a third-party gathering system. Production in fourth-quarter 2011 rose to 27 MMcf/d, up 238 percent vs. 8 MMcf/d in the same period in 2010. As of mid-February 2012, Marcellus production increased to 59 MMcf/d.
Overall, total natural gas production increased 5 percent in 2011, from an average of 1,096 MMcf/d in 2010 to 1,153 MMcf/d in 2011.
The domestic net realized averaged price for natural gas in 2011 was $4.30 per Mcf vs. $4.57 in 2010. The domestic net realized averaged price for NGL in 2011 was $40.17 per barrel vs. $35.02 in 2010. The net realized averaged price for domestic oil in 2011 was $85.38 per barrel vs. $66.32 in 2010. All amounts are inclusive of hedges.
 
WPX has previously announced that it expects to grow its overall production by 4 percent in 2012 on an Mcf equivalent basis, driven by capital investments in oil and NGL production. Natural gas production is expected to remain flat in 2012.
EXPENSES
On a per-unit basis, WPX's domestic lease operating expense (LOE) decreased 8 percent in 2011 to $0.55 per Mcfe vs. $0.60 per Mcfe in 2010. Actual charges were $268 million in 2011 vs. $267 million in 2010.
In 2011, WPX negotiated new fee-based contracts for liquids processing in the Piceance Basin. While these contributed to domestic gathering, processing and transportation charges of $1.02 per Mcfe in 2011 vs. $0.73 per Mcfe in 2010, they allow WPX to retain the vast majority of its NGL production in this basin.
Revenues associated with the new fee-based contracts more than offset the increase in fees. Actual charges for the domestic gathering, processing and transportation charges were $499 million in 2011 vs. $326 million in 2010.
Taxes other than income for domestic operations were $0.24 per Mcfe in 2011 and 2010. Actual charges were $119 million in 2011 vs. $109 million in 2010. The slight increase is primarily associated with greater oil and NGL volumes.
Domestic general and administrative expenses (G&A) totaled $0.56 per Mcfe in 2011 vs. $0.55 per Mcfe in 2010 due in part to the formation of two new asset teams who manage and operate WPX's developments in the Bakken and Marcellus shales. Actual charges were $273 million in 2011 vs. $244 million in 2010.
Domestic depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses (DD&A) were $1.89 per Mcfe in 2011 vs. $1.92 per Mcfe in 2010. Actual charges were $927 million in 2011 vs. $858 million in 2010.
 
ADJUSTED EBITDAX
EBITDAX represents earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization and exploration expenses. Adjusted EBITDAX includes adjustments for impairments and discontinued operations.
WPX had adjusted EBITDAX of $1,330 million for the year-ended Dec. 31, 2011  essentially equal to adjusted EBITDAX in 2010.
For the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2011, WPX had adjusted EBITDAX of $340 million, up 5.5 percent from $322 million of adjusted EBITDAX for the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
WPX is forecasting full-year EBITDAX of approximately $1.2 billion for 2012. This assumes the impact of the company's existing hedges, a $3 NYMEX natural gas price and a $99 per barrel oil price.
A $0.10 change in the price of natural gas equates to an estimated $20 million impact to EBITDAX. A $1 change in the price of oil equates to an estimated $5 million impact to EBITDAX, inclusive of the related impact to NGL.
CASH AND LIQUIDITY
In connection with the separation from Williams, WPX entered into a $1.5 billion revolving credit agreement that became effective in November. The facility remains undrawn.
In November, WPX also issued $1.5 billion of senior notes consisting of $1.1 billion at 6.0 percent due 2022 and $400 million at 5.25 percent due 2017. Approximately $981 million of these proceeds were distributed to Williams.
At Dec. 31, 2011, WPX had approximately $526 million in cash and cash equivalents  including $38 million for international operations  resulting in total liquidity of approximately $2 billion.
2011 DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
In 2011, WPX participated in 1,241 gross (694 net) wells in the United States, of which only two were nonproductive. The number of gross wells refers to the number of wells completed during 2011.
Last year, WPX invested $1.461 billion in drilling and development, excluding costs for facilities construction. Approximately 84 percent of this capital was deployed in the Bakken Shale, Piceance Basin and Marcellus Shale.
WPX's 2011 domestic drilling, finding and development cost for adding proved reserves was $1.57 per Mcfe, compared with $1.95 a year ago.
Highlights for each of the company's areas are provided below. All volumes are reported on a net basis.
 
 
 
 
 
 
RESERVES
As of Dec. 31, 2011, WPX's total proved reserves increased to a company high of nearly 5.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent  up approximately 9 percent vs. 2010.
Approximately 77 percent of WPX's 2011 total proved reserves are natural gas and 23 percent natural gas liquids (NGL) and crude oil. At year-end 2010, natural gas accounted for 83 percent of the company's reserves using an industry standard ratio of 6-to-1 to convert oil and NGL to natural gas equivalent.
Today, WPX also is reporting that its total proved, probable, and possible (3P) reserves increased 7 percent to approximately 18.5 Tcfe. The 3P figure consists of approximately 5.3 Bcfe in proved reserves, 7.7 Bcfe in probable reserves and 5.5 Bcfe in possible reserves.
 
At year-end 2010, WPX had 3P reserves of approximately 17.3 Tcfe after using an industry standard ratio of 6-to-1 to convert oil and NGL reserves to natural gas equivalent.
2012 CAPITAL INVESTMENT
As previously reported, 95 percent of WPX's 2012 $1.2 billion domestic capital budget is focused on the company's core areas in the Bakken Shale, Piceance Basin and Marcellus Shale, with approximately 65 percent of the budget designated for areas with oil and NGL production.
For 2012, WPX plans to add a sixth rig in the Bakken Shale at mid-year and deploy an average of five rigs in the Piceance Basin and three rigs in Susquehanna County in the Marcellus Shale.
In keeping with the company's philosophy for capital discipline, this equates to a more than 40 percent decrease in the company' s rig count in the Piceance and Marcellus vs. the original plan for 2012 activity.
The company's 2012 capital spending is expected to yield a 50-60 percent increase in domestic oil production and an 8 percent increase in NGL production.

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press release that address activities, events or developments that the company expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the company. Statements regarding future drilling and production are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties normally incident to the exploration for and development and production of oil and gas. These risks include, but are not limited to, the volatility of oil, natural gas and NGL prices; uncertainties inherent in estimating oil, natural gas and NGL reserves; drilling risks; environmental risks; and political or regulatory changes. Investors are cautioned that any such statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release are made as of the date of this press release, even if subsequently made available by WPX Energy on its website or otherwise. WPX Energy does not undertake and expressly disclaims any obligation to update the forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Investors are urged to consider carefully the disclosure in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, available from us at WPX Energy, Attn: Investor Relations, P.O. Box 21810, Tulsa, Okla., 74102, or from the SEC's website at .

Additionally, the SEC requires oil and gas companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose proved reserves, which are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible  from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and governmental regulations. The SEC permits the optional disclosure of probable and possible reserves. From time to time, we elect to use "probable" reserves and "possible" reserves, excluding their valuation. The SEC defines "probable" reserves as "those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered." The SEC defines"possible" reserves as "those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves." The Company has applied these definitions in estimating probable and possible reserves. Statements of reserves are only estimates and may not correspond to the ultimate quantities of oil and gas recovered. Any reserve estimates provided in this presentation that are not specifically designated as being estimates of proved reserves may include estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with, or contemplated by, the SEC's reserves reporting guidelines. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our SEC filings that may be accessed through the SEC's website at .

The SEC's rules prohibit us from filing resource estimates. Our resource estimations include estimates of hydrocarbon quantities for (i) new areas for which we do not have sufficient information to date to classify as proved, probable or even possible reserves, (ii) other areas to take into account the low level of certainty of recovery of the resources and (iii) uneconomic proved, probable or possible reserves. Resource estimates do not take into account the certainty of resource recovery and are therefore not indicative of the expected future recovery and should not be relied upon. Resource estimates might never be recovered and are contingent on exploration success, technical improvements in drilling access, commerciality and other factors.
