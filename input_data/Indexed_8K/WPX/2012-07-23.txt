The terms of the Agreements are the same for all of the NEOs except as specifically noted below.
Company
NEOs
Agreements
A "Change in Control" occurs if any one or more of the following happens during the term of the Agreements:
 
 
 
 
A Change in Control will not occur if the NEO agrees in writing prior to an event that such an event will not constitute a Change in Control.
If a Change in Control occurs and, within two years following the Change in Control, (i) the NEO's employment is terminated other than for Cause (as defined in the Agreements), Disability (as defined in the Agreements), death, or a Disqualifying Disaggregation (as defined in the Agreements) or (ii) the NEO resigns for Good Reason (as defined in the Agreements), then, in addition to any accrued but unpaid salary, earned bonus, paid time off, or other accrued benefits, the NEO is entitled to a lump-sum cash amount equal to the sum of (1) the NEO's target annual bonus for the year in which the termination occurs prorated through the termination date, plus (2) a severance amount equal to:
 
 
 
 
 
 
The effect on any stock options or restricted shares held by the NEO will be determined in accordance with the applicable award agreements.
The NEO will also receive continued participation in the Company's welfare benefit plans for so long as he elects coverage, up to a maximum of 18 months from the termination, in the same manner and at the same cost as similarly situated active employees; continued participation in the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance for six years or any known longer applicable statute of limitations period; continued indemnification on the same terms as other peer executives to the greatest extent permitted by law and the Company's bylaws; and reimbursement for outplacement services for six months at a cost not exceeding $25,000.
The Change in Control Agreements contain a "best-net" provision which provides that, if IRS Code Section 280G applies to payments made under the agreement and such payments trigger an excise tax, then those payments may be reduced to an amount that will not trigger the excise tax, if such reduction would result in a greater net amount paid to the NEO.
If the NEO's employment is terminated for cause within two years following a Change in Control, the NEO will be entitled to a lump sum payment consisting of accrued but unpaid base salary, accrued earned but unpaid annual bonus, accrued but unpaid paid time off, and any other amounts or benefits due but not paid.
The severance benefits described above are subject to the NEOs execution of a release and waiver of claims against the Company and its affiliates and continued compliance with certain restrictive covenants such as confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation following the NEO's termination. The Agreements supersede all prior change in control agreements relating to severance or benefits between the NEOs and the Company.
The foregoing description of the Agreements is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement for Mr. Hill, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated into this Item 5.02 by reference, and the Agreement for Mr. Sailor, Mr. Bender, Mr. Guderian, and Mr. Buck, which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated into this Item 5.02 by reference.

This Agreement is intended to accomplish these objectives and does not apply to any termination of employment not occurring during the Post-Change Period (as defined below).

(c) . In the event that the existence of Cause during a Post-Change Period shall become an issue in any action or proceeding between Executive and WPX, WPX shall, notwithstanding the Cause Determination, have the burden of establishing that the actions or omissions specified in the Notice of Consideration did in fact occur and do constitute Cause and that WPX has satisfied all applicable substantive and procedural requirements of this Section.

For purposes of this Section 2.6, "spread" in respect of any Stock Option shall mean the product of the number of shares as to which such Stock Option has been exercised during the one year period prior to the Breach Date multiplied by the difference between the closing price of the common stock on the exercise date (or if the common stock did not trade on the New York Stock Exchange or other exchange, if any, on which common stock had a higher trading volume at the time, on the exercise date, the most recent date on which the common stock did so trade) and the exercise price of the Stock Options.
Breach of Covenants
3.1 . If at any time or from time to time, it shall be determined by independent tax professionals selected by WPX ("") that any payment or other benefit to Executive pursuant to Article II of this Agreement or otherwise ("") is or will, but for the provisions of this Article III, become subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any similar tax payable under any state, local, foreign or other law, but expressly excluding any income taxes and penalties or interest imposed pursuant to Section 409A of the Code (""), then Executive's Potential Parachute Payment shall be either (a) provided to Executive in full, or (b) provided to Executive as to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such benefits being subject to the Excise Taxes, whichever of the foregoing amounts, when taking into account applicable federal, state, local and foreign income and employment taxes, the Excise Tax, and any other applicable taxes, results in the receipt by Executive, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such benefits may be taxable under the Excise Taxes ("").

reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of the Code and other applicable legal authority. WPX and Executive shall furnish to the Tax Professional such information and documents as the Tax Professional may reasonably request in order to make a determination under Section 3.1. WPX shall bear all costs the Tax Professional may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by Section 3.1.

The Repayment Amount shall be the smallest such amount, if any, as shall be required to be paid to WPX so that Executive's net after-tax proceeds with respect to the Payments (after taking into account the payment of the Excise Taxes and all other applicable taxes imposed on such benefits) shall be maximized. The Repayment Amount shall be zero if a Repayment Amount of more than zero would not result in Executive's net after-tax proceeds with respect to the Payments being maximized. If the Excise Taxes are not eliminated pursuant to this Section 3.3, Executive shall pay the Excise Taxes.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article III, if (i) there is a reduction in the payments to an Executive as described above in this Article III, (ii) the IRS later determines that Executive is liable for Excise Taxes, the payment of which would result in the maximization of Executive's net after-tax proceeds (calculated based on the full amount of the Potential Parachute Payment and as if Executive's benefits had not previously been reduced), and (iii) Executive pays the Excise Tax, then WPX shall pay to Executive those payments which were reduced pursuant to Section 3.1 or 3.3(a) as soon as administratively possible after Executive pays the Excise Taxes to the extent that Executive's net after-tax proceeds with respect to the payment of the Payments are maximized.

For this purpose, (i) any reimbursement shall be for expenses incurred during Executive's lifetime or within two additional years following Executive's death, (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or benefits provided, in one calendar year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year, (iii) the reimbursement of any eligible expense will be made no later than the last day of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred, and (iv) the right to any reimbursement or benefit shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit.
(c) If Executive does not prevail (after exhaustion of all available judicial remedies) in respect of a claim by Executive or by WPX, hereunder, and such party establishes before a court of competent jurisdiction that Executive had no reasonable basis for his claim hereunder, or for his response to such party's claim hereunder, or acted in bad faith, no further payment of or reimbursement for Legal and Other Expenses shall be due to Executive in respect of such claim and Executive shall refund any amounts previously paid or reimbursed hereunder with respect to such claim.
4.2 . If an amount due is not paid to Executive under this Agreement within five business days after such amount first became due and owing, interest shall accrue on such amount from the date it became due and owing until the date of payment at an annual rate equal to 200 basis points above the base commercial lending rate published in in effect from time to time during the period of such nonpayment.

These obligations shall continue during and after the termination of Executive's employment for any reason and for so long as the Confidential Information remains Confidential Information.

Authorized
WPX Executive

Business, (ii) give Executive any right or ability, directly or indirectly, to control or influence the policy decisions or management of such Competitive Business, or (iii) create a conflict of interest between Executive's duties to WPX and its Affiliates or under this Agreement and his interest in such investment.

Executive agrees that any Work Product shall be the property of WPX and, if subject to copyright, shall be considered a "work made for hire" within the meaning of the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended. If and to the extent that any such Work Product is not a "work made for hire" within the meaning of the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended, Executive hereby assigns,
 
and agrees to assign, to WPX all right, title and interest in and to the Work Product and all copies thereof, and all copyrights , patent rights, trademark rights, trade secret rights and all other proprietary and intellectual property rights in the Work Product, without further consideration, free from any claim, lien for balance due, or rights of retention thereto on the part of Executive.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, WPX agrees and acknowledges that the provisions of Section 6.4(a) relating to ownership and disclosure of Work Product do not apply to any inventions or other subject matter for which no equipment, supplies, facility, or trade secret information of WPX or an Affiliate was used and that are developed entirely on Executive's own time, unless: (i) the invention or other subject matter relates (a) to the business of WPX or an Affiliate, or (b) to the actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of WPX or any Affiliate, or (ii) the invention or other subject matter results from any work performed by Executive for WPX or any Affiliate.
(c) Executive agrees that, upon disclosure of Work Product to WPX, Executive will, during his employment by WPX or an Affiliate and at any time thereafter, at the request and cost of WPX, execute all such documents and perform all such acts as WPX or an Affiliate (or their respective duly authorized agents) may reasonably require: (i) to apply for, obtain and vest in the name of WPX alone (unless WPX otherwise directs) letters patent, copyrights or other intellectual property protection in any country throughout the world, and when so obtained or vested to renew and restore the same; and (ii) to prosecute or defend any opposition proceedings in respect of such applications and any opposition proceedings or petitions or applications for revocation of such letters patent, copyright or other intellectual property protection, or otherwise in respect of the Work Product.
(d) In the event that WPX is unable, after reasonable effort, to secure Executive's execution of such documents as provided in Section 6.4(c), whether because of Executive's physical or mental incapacity or for any other reason whatsoever, Executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints WPX and its duly authorized officers and agents as his agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on his behalf to execute and file any such application or applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution, issuance and protection of letters patent, copyright and other intellectual property protection with the same legal force and effect as if personally executed by Executive.
6.5 .
Non-Disparagement
(a) Executive agrees not to make, or cause to be made, any statement, observation or opinion, or communicate any information (whether oral or written, directly or indirectly) that (i) accuses or implies that WPX and/or any of its Affiliates, together with their respective present or former officers, directors, partners, stockholders, employees and agents, and each of their predecessors, successors and assigns, engaged in any wrongful, unlawful or improper conduct, whether relating to Executive's employment (or the termination thereof), the business or operations of WPX, or
 
otherwise; or (ii) disparages, impugns or in any way reflects adversely upon the business or reputation of WPX and/or any of its Affiliates, together with their respective present or former officers, directors, partners, stockholders, employees and agents, and each of their predecessors, successors and assigns.
(b) WPX agrees not to authorize any statement, observation or opinion, or communicate any information (whether oral or written, direct or indirect) that (i) accuses or implies that Executive engaged in any wrongful, unlawful or improper conduct relating to Executive's employment or termination thereof with WPX, or otherwise; or (ii) disparages, impugns or in any way reflects adversely upon the reputation of Executive.
(c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude Executive or WPX from providing truthful testimony or information pursuant to subpoena, court order or other similar legal or regulatory process, provided, that to the extent permitted by law, Executive will promptly inform WPX of any such obligation prior to participating in any such proceedings.
6.6 .
Reasonableness of Restrictive Covenants
(a) Executive acknowledges that the covenants contained in this Agreement are reasonable in the scope of the activities restricted, the geographic area covered by the restrictions, and the duration of the restrictions, and that such covenants are reasonably necessary to protect WPX's legitimate interests in its Confidential Information, its proprietary work, and in its relationships with its employees, customers, suppliers and agents.
(b) WPX has, and Executive has had an opportunity to, consult with their respective legal counsel and to be advised concerning the reasonableness and propriety of such covenants. Executive acknowledges that his observance of the covenants contained herein will not deprive Executive of the ability to earn a livelihood or to support his or her dependents.
(c) Executive understands he is bound by the terms of this Article VI, whether or not he receives severance payments under the Agreement or otherwise.
6.7 .
Right to Injunction: Survival of Undertakings
(a) In recognition of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information, and in recognition of the necessity of the limited restrictions imposed by this Agreement, Executive and WPX agree that it would be impossible to measure solely in money the damages which WPX would suffer if Executive were to breach any of his obligations hereunder. Executive acknowledges that any breach of any provision of this Agreement would irreparably injure WPX. Accordingly, Executive agrees that if he breaches any of the provisions of Article VI of this Agreement, WPX shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedies to which WPX may be entitled under this Agreement or otherwise, to an injunction to be issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, to restrain any breach, or threatened breach, of any provision of this Agreement without the necessity of posting a bond or other security therefor, and Executive hereby waives any right to assert any claim or defense that WPX has an adequate remedy at law for any such breach.
 
(b) If a court determines that any covenant included in this Article VI is unenforceable in whole or in part because of such covenant's duration or geographical or other scope, such court shall have the power to modify the duration or scope of such provision, as the case may be, so as to cause such covenant as so modified to be enforceable. Furthermore, if a court determines that a certain form of remedy or relief sought by WPX for the breach of a covenant included in this Article VI is unavailable under applicable law, such a finding shall not prohibit WPX from obtaining a different form of remedy or relief with respect to such breach which such court has not found to be unavailable.
(c) All of the provisions of this Agreement shall survive any Separation from Service of Executive, without regard to the reasons for such termination. Notwithstanding Section 2.6, in addition to any other rights it may have, neither WPX nor any Affiliate shall have any obligation to pay or provide severance or other benefits (except as may be required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended) after the Termination Date if Executive has materially breached any of Executive's obligations under Article VI of this Agreement.
7.1 . To the extent that Executive shall have received severance payments or other severance benefits under any other plan, program, policy, practice or procedure or agreement of WPX prior to receiving severance payments or other severance benefits pursuant to Article II, the severance payments or other severance benefits under such other plan, program, policy, practice or procedure or agreement shall reduce (but not below zero) the corresponding severance payments or other benefits to which Executive shall be entitled under Article II. To the extent that Executive accepts payments made pursuant to Article II, he shall be deemed to have waived his right to receive a corresponding amount of future severance payments or other severance benefits under any other plan, program, policy, practice or procedure or agreement of WPX.
Waiver of Certain Other Rights
7.2 . Except as expressly provided in Section 7.1 and as provided in the Recitals to this Agreement, this Agreement shall not prevent or limit Executive's continuing or future participation in any benefit, bonus, incentive or other plan, program, policy, practice or procedure provided by WPX and for which Executive may qualify, nor shall this Agreement limit or otherwise affect such rights as Executive may have under any other agreements with WPX. Amounts that are vested benefits or that Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan, program, policy, practice or procedure and any other payment or benefit required by law at or after the Termination Date shall be payable in accordance with such plan, program, policy, practice or procedure or applicable law except as expressly modified by this Agreement.
Other Rights
 
7.3 . Nothing in this Agreement shall guarantee the right of Executive to continue in employment, and WPX retains the right to terminate Executive's employment at any time for any reason or for no reason.
No Right to Continued Employment

8.2 . If a Claim is denied, in whole or in part, or if a Claim is neither approved nor denied within the 30-day period specified Section 8.1(b), the Claimant (or his or her authorized representative) shall have the right at any time to (a) request that WPX (or such other person as shall be designated in writing by WPX) review the denial or the failure to approve or deny the Claim, (b) review pertinent documents, and (c) submit issues and comments in writing. Within 30 days after such a request is received, WPX shall complete its review and give the Claimant written notice of its decision.

This Agreement is intended to accomplish these objectives and does not apply to any termination of employment not occurring during the Post-Change Period (as defined below).

6.5 .
Non-Disparagement
(a) Executive agrees not to make, or cause to be made, any statement, observation or opinion, or communicate any information (whether oral or written, directly or indirectly) that (i) accuses or implies that WPX and/or any of its Affiliates, together with their respective present or former officers, directors, partners, stockholders, employees and agents, and each of their predecessors, successors and assigns, engaged in any wrongful, unlawful or improper conduct, whether relating to Executive's employment (or the termination thereof), the business or operations of WPX, or

Right to Injunction: Survival of Undertakings
(a) In recognition of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information, and in recognition of the necessity of the limited restrictions imposed by this Agreement, Executive and WPX agree that it would be impossible to measure solely in money the damages which WPX would suffer if Executive were to breach any of his obligations hereunder.

(b) If a court determines that any covenant included in this Article VI is unenforceable in whole or in part because of such covenant's duration or geographical or other scope, such court shall have the power to modify the duration or scope of such provision, as the case may be, so as to cause such covenant as so modified to be enforceable. Furthermore, if a court determines that a certain form of remedy or relief sought by WPX for the breach of a covenant included in this Article VI is unavailable under applicable law, such a finding shall not prohibit WPX from obtaining a different form of remedy or relief with respect to such breach which such court has not found to be unavailable.
(c) All of the provisions of this Agreement shall survive any Separation from Service of Executive, without regard to the reasons for such termination. Notwithstanding Section 2.6, in addition to any other rights it may have, neither WPX nor any Affiliate shall have any obligation to pay or provide severance or other benefits (except as may be required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended) after the Termination Date if Executive has materially breached any of Executive's obligations under Article VI of this Agreement.
7.1 . To the extent that Executive shall have received severance payments or other severance benefits under any other plan, program, policy, practice or procedure or agreement of WPX prior to receiving severance payments or other severance benefits pursuant to Article II, the severance payments or other severance benefits under such other plan, program, policy, practice or procedure or agreement shall reduce (but not below zero) the corresponding severance payments or other benefits to which Executive shall be entitled under Article II. To the extent that Executive accepts payments made pursuant to Article II, he shall be deemed to have waived his right to receive a corresponding amount of future severance payments or other severance benefits under any other plan, program, policy, practice or procedure or agreement of WPX.
Waiver of Certain Other Rights
7.2 . Except as expressly provided in Section 7.1 and as provided in the Recitals to this Agreement, this Agreement shall not prevent or limit Executive's continuing or future participation in any benefit, bonus, incentive or other plan, program, policy, practice or procedure provided by WPX and for which Executive may qualify, nor shall this Agreement limit or otherwise affect such rights as Executive may have under any other agreements with WPX. Amounts that are vested benefits or that Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan, program, policy, practice or procedure and any other payment or benefit required by law at or after the Termination Date shall be payable in accordance with such plan, program, policy, practice or procedure or applicable law except as expressly modified by this Agreement.
