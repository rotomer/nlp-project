Issuance of Floating Rate Notes due 2008, 5.400% Notes due 2011 and 6.200% Notes due 2036
On November 17, 2006, The Western Union Company ("Western Union" or the "Company") issued $2,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's fixed and floating rate notes, comprised of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's Floating Rate Notes due 2008 (the "Floating Rate Notes"), $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.400% Notes due 2011 (the "2011 Notes") and $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6.200% Notes due 2036 (the "2036 Notes"). The Floating Rate Notes, the 2011 Notes and the 2036 Notes are collectively referred to herein as the "Notes." Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will be set at a per annum rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 0.15%, which will be reset quarterly. The Notes were issued in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture (the "Indenture") dated as of November 17, 2006, between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). A copy of the Indenture is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and incorporated herein by reference into this Item 2.03. A copy of the form of Floating Rate Note, a copy of the form of 2011 Note and a copy of the form of 2036 Note are attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2, Exhibit 4.3 and Exhibit 4.4, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference into this Item 2.03.
The Company used the net proceeds of the offering of the Notes, together with the proceeds of commercial paper the Company issued, to repay the entire $2.4 billion in principal amount outstanding under a bridge loan facility entered into by the Company's subsidiary, First Financial Management Corporation ("FFMC"). This repayment resulted in the release and termination of the outstanding guarantees by FFMC of the Company's 5.930% notes due 2016 and the Company's revolving credit facility.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
Registration Rights Agreement
In connection with the issuance of the Notes, on November 17, 2006, Western Union entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the initial purchasers of the Notes which will give holders of the Notes certain exchange and registration rights with respect to the Notes.

At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series having attached thereto appropriate coupons, if any, executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication together with the applicable documents referred to below in this Section, and the Trustee shall thereupon authenticate and deliver such Securities to or upon the written order of the Company, signed by an Officer, or pursuant to such procedures acceptable to the Trustee and such recipients, without any further action by the Company. In authenticating such Securities, the Trustee shall be
 
entitled to receive prior to the authentication of any Securities of such series, and (subject to Article 7) shall be fully protected in relying upon, unless and until such documents have been superseded or revoked:
(a) any Board Resolution and/or executed supplemental indenture referred to in Sections 2.01 and 2.03 by or pursuant to which the forms and terms of the Securities of that series were established;
(b) an Officers' Certificate setting forth the form or forms and terms of the Securities, stating that the form or forms and terms of the Securities of such series have been, or, in the case of a Periodic Offering, will be when established in accordance with such procedures as shall be referred to therein, established in compliance with this Indenture; and
(c) an Opinion of Counsel substantially to the following effect, which Opinion of Counsel may contain such assumptions, qualifications and limitations as such counsel shall reasonably deem appropriate: (i) the form or forms and terms of the Securities of such series have been, or, in the case of a Periodic Offering, will be when established in accordance with such procedures as shall be referred to therein, established in compliance with this Indenture and the supplemental indenture, to the extent applicable, and (ii) such Securities have been duly authorized and, if executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered and duly paid for, would be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding of equity or law).
The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the Trustee reasonably determines that the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture in any material respect or may not be lawfully taken.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 2.01 and this Section 2.02, if, in connection with a Periodic Offering, all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Board Resolution otherwise required pursuant to Section 2.01 or the written order, Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to this Section 2.02 at or prior to the authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.
With respect to Securities of a series offered in a Periodic Offering, the Trustee may rely, as to the authorization by the Company of any of such
 
Securities, the forms and terms thereof and the legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability thereof, upon the Opinion of Counsel and the other documents delivered pursuant to Section 2.01 and this Section 2.02, as applicable, in connection with the first authentication of Securities of such series.
If the Company shall establish pursuant to or as contemplated by Section 2.03 that the Securities of a series or a portion thereof are to be issued in the form of one or more Registered Global Securities, then the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver one or more Registered Global Securities in temporary or permanent form that (i) shall represent and shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of all of the Securities of such series issued in such form and not yet cancelled, (ii) shall be registered in the name of the Depositary for such Registered Global Security or Securities or the nominee of such Depositary, (iii) shall be delivered by the Trustee to such Depositary or pursuant to such Depositary's instructions and (iv) shall bear a legend substantially to the following effect: "This Security is a Registered Global Security within the meaning of the Indenture hereinafter referred to and is registered in the name of a Depositary or a nominee thereof. This Security is exchangeable for Securities registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary or its nominee only in the limited circumstances described in the Indenture and, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive registered form, this Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to the nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary."

If the Securities of any series are issued in both registered and unregistered form, except as otherwise established pursuant to Section 2.03, at the option of the Holder thereof, Unregistered Securities of any series may be exchanged for Registered Securities of such series and tenor having authorized denominations and an equal aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of such Unregistered Securities to be exchanged at the agency of the Company that shall be maintained for such purpose in accordance with Section 4.02, with, in the case of Unregistered Securities that have coupons attached, all unmatured coupons and all matured coupons in default thereto appertaining, and upon payment, if the Company shall so require, of the charges hereinafter provided. At the option of the Holder thereof, if Unregistered Securities of any series, maturity date, interest rate and Original Issue Date are issued in more than

The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any exchange or registration of transfer of Securities. No service charge shall be made for any such transaction.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.07, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive registered form, a Registered Global Security representing all or a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
If at any time the Depositary for any Registered Global Securities of any series notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Registered Global Securities or if at any time the Depositary for such Registered Global Securities shall no longer be eligible under applicable
 
law, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to appoint a successor Depositary eligible under applicable law with respect to such Registered Global Securities. If a successor Depositary eligible under applicable law for such Registered Global Securities is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of the Company's order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Registered Securities of such series shall authenticate and deliver, as specified in such order, Registered Securities of such series in definitive form, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Registered Global Securities, in exchange for such Registered Global Securities.

If established by the Company pursuant to Section 2.03 with respect to any Registered Global Security, the Depositary for such Registered Global Security may surrender such Registered Global Security in exchange in whole or in part for Registered Securities of the same series in definitive registered form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge,
(a) to each Person specified by such Depositary, new Registered Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations as requested by such Person, in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Registered Global Security; and
(b) to such Depositary, a new Registered Global Security in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Registered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of Registered Securities authenticated and delivered pursuant to clause (a) above.
 
Registered Securities issued in exchange for a Registered Global Security pursuant to this Section 2.07 shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Registered Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee.

Notwithstanding anything herein or in the forms or terms of any Securities to the contrary, none of the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be required to exchange any Unregistered Security for a Registered Security if such exchange would result in adverse federal income tax consequences to the Company (such as, for example, the inability of the Company to deduct from its income, as computed for federal income tax purposes, the interest payable on the Unregistered Securities) under then applicable United States federal income tax laws. The Trustee and any such agent shall be entitled to rely on an Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel in determining such result.
The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of, or exchange Securities of any particular series during the period from the opening of business 15 days before the day a notice of redemption relating to such Securities selected for redemption is sent to the close of business on the day that notice is sent, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or part, except for the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
. . If any mutilated Security or a Security with a mutilated coupon appertaining to it is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for such mutilated Security or in exchange for the Security to which a mutilated coupon appertains, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, with coupons corresponding to the coupons, if any, appertaining to such mutilated Security or to the Security to which such mutilated coupon appertains.
Section 2.08
Replacement Securities
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security or coupon and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to hold each of them and any agent of any of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security or coupon has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and
 
deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for the Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains (with all appurtenant coupons not destroyed, lost or stolen), a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, with coupons corresponding to the coupons, if any, appertaining to such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or to the Security to which such destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or coupon has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security or coupon (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Security or coupon) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to hold each of them and any agent of any of them harmless, and in the case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee and any agent of them of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and the ownership thereof; that the Principal of and any interest on Unregistered Securities shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 4.02, be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States.
provided, however,
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Security of any series, with its coupons, if any, issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for any mutilated Security, or in exchange for a Security to which a mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains, shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security and its coupons, if any, or the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen coupon shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and any such new Security and coupons, if any, shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series and their coupons, if any, duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) any other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or coupons.
. . Securities outstanding at any time are all Securities that have been authenticated by the Trustee except for those cancelled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation, those described in this Section as not outstanding and those that have been defeased pursuant to Section 8.05.
Section 2.09
Outstanding Securities
 
If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.08, it ceases to be outstanding unless and until the Trustee and the Company receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Security is held by a holder in due course.
If the Paying Agent (other than the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) holds on the maturity date or any redemption date or date for repurchase of the Securities money sufficient to pay Securities payable or to be redeemed or repurchased on that date, then on and after that date such Securities cease to be outstanding and interest on them shall cease to accrue.
A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or one of its Affiliates holds such Security unless cancelled pursuant to Section 2.11, , that, in determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of the outstanding Securities have given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver hereunder, Securities owned by the Company or any affiliate of the Company shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding, except that, in determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying upon any such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver, only Securities as to which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has received written notice to be so owned shall be so disregarded. Any Securities so owned which are pledged by the Company, or by any Affiliate of the Company, as security for loans or other obligations, otherwise than to another such Affiliate of the Company, shall be deemed to be outstanding, if the pledgee is entitled to act with respect to such Securities.
provided, however
In determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of the outstanding Securities have given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver hereunder, the principal amount of an Original Issue Discount Security that shall be deemed to be outstanding shall be the amount of the principal thereof that would be due and payable as of the date of such determination upon acceleration of the maturity thereof pursuant to Section 6.02.
. . Until definitive Securities of any series are ready for delivery, the Company may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver temporary Securities of such series. Temporary Securities of any series shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities of such series but may have insertions, substitutions, omissions and other variations determined to be appropriate by the Officers executing the temporary Securities, as evidenced by their execution of such temporary Securities. If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company shall cause definitive Securities of such series to be prepared without unreasonable delay.
Section 2.10
Temporary Securities
After preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of such temporary Securities at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose pursuant to Section 4.02, without charge to
 
the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Securities of such series and tenor and authorized denominations. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.
. . The Company or one of its Affiliates at any time may deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company or one of its Affiliates may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold. The Registrar, any transfer agent and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Securities surrendered to them for transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee shall promptly cancel and dispose of in accordance with its customary procedures all Securities surrendered for transfer, exchange, payment or cancellation and shall deliver a certificate of disposition to the Company. The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities it has paid in full or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
Section 2.11
Cancellation
. . The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" and "CINS" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall, as a convenience, use CUSIP numbers or CINS numbers, as the case may be, in notices to Holders and no representation shall be made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice, and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities.
Section 2.12
CUSIP Numbers
. . If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on the Registered Securities, it shall pay, or shall deposit with the Paying Agent money in immediately available funds sufficient to pay, the defaulted interest to the Persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date, which shall mean the 15th day next preceding the date fixed by the Company for the payment of defaulted interest, whether or not such day is a Business Day. At least 10 days before such special record date, the Company shall mail to each Holder of such Registered Securities and to the Trustee a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest to be paid. Notice of the proposed payment of such defaulted interest and the special record date therefor having been so mailed, such defaulted interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective predecessor securities) are registered at the close of business on such special record date.

Section 3.03
Payment Of Securities Called For Redemption
 
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal shall, until paid or duly provided for, bear interest from the date fixed for redemption at the rate of interest or Yield to Maturity (in the case of an Original Issue Discount Security) borne by such Security.
If any Security with coupons attached thereto is surrendered for redemption and is not accompanied by all appurtenant coupons maturing after the date fixed for redemption, the surrender of such missing coupon or coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee, if there be furnished to each of them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them harmless.

Mandatory and Optional Sinking Funds
mandatory sinking fund payment
optional sinking fund payment
sinking fund payment date
In lieu of making all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any series of Securities of a series in cash, the Company may at its option (a) deliver to the Trustee Securities of such series theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company or receive credit for the principal amount of Securities of such series (not previously so credited) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except as aforesaid) by the Company and delivered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.11, (b) receive credit for optional sinking fund payments (not previously so credited) made pursuant to this Section
 
or (c) receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) redeemed by the Company at the option of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through any optional sinking fund payment pursuant to the terms of such Securities. Securities so delivered or credited shall be received or credited by the Trustee at the sinking fund redemption price specified in such Securities and the amount of mandatory sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
On or before the sixtieth day next preceding each sinking fund payment date for any series, or such shorter period as shall be acceptable to the Trustee, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate (a) specifying the portion of the mandatory sinking fund payment to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion to be satisfied by credit of specified Securities of such series and the basis for such credit and (b) stating whether or not the Company intends to exercise its right to make an optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series. Any Securities of such series to be credited and required to be delivered to the Trustee in order for the Company to be entitled to credit therefor as aforesaid which have not theretofore been delivered to the Trustee shall be delivered for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.11 to the Trustee with such Officers' Certificate (or reasonably promptly thereafter if acceptable to the Trustee). Such Officers' Certificate shall be irrevocable and upon its receipt by the Trustee the Company shall become obligated to make all the cash payments, delivery of Securities or crediting therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Failure of the Company, on or before any such sixtieth day, to deliver such Officer's Certificate and Securities specified in this paragraph, if any, shall not constitute a default but shall constitute, on and as of such date, the irrevocable election of the Company (i) that the mandatory sinking fund payment for such series due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date shall be paid entirely in cash without the option to deliver or credit Securities of such series in respect thereof and (ii) that the Company shall make no optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series as provided in this Section.
If the sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional) to be made in cash on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in cash shall exceed $50,000 or the equivalent in foreign currency if to be paid out in such currency (or a lesser sum if the Company shall so request with respect to the Securities of any series), such cash shall be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date to the redemption of Securities of such series at the sinking fund redemption price thereof together with accrued interest thereon to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption. If such amount shall be $50,000 (or such lesser sum) or less and the Company makes no such request then it shall be carried over until a sum in excess of $50,000 (or such lesser sum) is available. The Trustee shall select, in the manner provided in Section 3.02, for redemption on such sinking fund payment date a sufficient principal amount of Securities of such series to absorb said cash, as nearly as may be, and shall (if requested in writing by the Company) inform the Company of the serial numbers of the Securities of such series (or
 
portions thereof) so selected. Securities shall be excluded from eligibility for redemption under this Section if they are identified by registration and certificate number in an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee at least 60 days prior to the sinking fund payment date as being owned of record and beneficially by, and not pledged or hypothecated by either (a) the Company or (b) an entity specifically identified in such Officers' Certificate as being an Affiliate of the Company. The Trustee, in the name and at the expense of the Company (or the Company, if it shall so request the Trustee in writing) shall cause notice of redemption of the Securities of such series to be given in substantially the manner provided in Section 3.02 (and with the effect provided in Section 3.03) for the redemption of Securities of such series in part at the option of the Company. The amount of any sinking fund payments not so applied or allocated to the redemption of Securities of such series shall be added to the next cash sinking fund payment for such series and, together with such payment, shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section. Any and all sinking fund moneys held on the stated maturity date of the Securities of any particular series (or earlier, if such maturity is accelerated), which are not held for the payment or redemption of particular Securities of such series shall be applied, together with other moneys, if necessary, sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the Principal of, and interest on, the Securities of such series at maturity.
On or before 10:00 a.m. New York City time on each sinking fund payment date or, in the case of Unregistered Securities, 10:00 a.m. New York City time on the Business Day prior to the sinking fund payment date, the Company shall pay to the Trustee in cash or shall otherwise provide for the payment of all interest accrued to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption on Securities or portions thereof to be redeemed on the next following sinking fund payment date.
The Trustee shall not redeem or cause to be redeemed any Securities of a series with sinking fund moneys or mail any notice of redemption of Securities of such series by operation of the sinking fund during the continuance of a Default in payment of interest on such Securities or of any Event of Default except that, where the mailing of notice of redemption of any Securities shall theretofore have been made, the Trustee shall redeem or cause to be redeemed such Securities, provided that it shall have received from the Company a sum sufficient for such redemption. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such Default or Event of Default shall occur, and any moneys thereafter paid into the sinking fund, shall, during the continuance of such Default or Event of Default, be deemed to have been collected under Article 6 and held for the payment of all such Securities. In case such Event of Default shall have been waived as provided in Section 6.04 or the Default cured on or before the sixtieth day preceding the sinking fund payment date in any year, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date in accordance with this Section to the redemption of such Securities.
 
Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.03, the covenants contained in this Article 4 shall be applicable to the Securities of any series.
. . The Company shall pay the Principal of and interest, if any, on the Securities of a series on the dates and in the manner provided in the Securities of that series and this Indenture. The interest on Securities with coupons attached (together with any additional amounts payable pursuant to the terms of such Securities) shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the several coupons for such interest installments as are evidenced thereby as they severally mature. The interest on any temporary Unregistered Securities (together with any additional amounts payable pursuant to the terms of such Securities) shall be paid, as to the installments of interest evidenced by coupons attached thereto, if any, only upon presentation and surrender thereof, and, as to the other installments of interest, if any, only upon presentation of such Unregistered Securities for notation thereon of the payment of such interest. The interest on Registered Securities (together with any additional amounts payable pursuant to the terms of such Securities) shall be payable only to the Holders thereof (subject to Section 2.04) and at the option of the Company may be paid by mailing checks for such interest payable to or upon the written order of such Holders at their last addresses as they appear on the Security Register of the Company.
Section 4.01
Payment of Securities
Notwithstanding any provisions of this Indenture and the Securities of any series to the contrary, if the Company and a Holder of any Registered Security so agree, payments of interest on, and any portion of the Principal of, such Holder's Registered Security shall be made by the Paying Agent, upon receipt from the Company of immediately available funds by 11:00 A.M., New York City time (or such other time as may be agreed to between the Company and the Paying Agent), directly to the Holder of such Security (by Federal funds wire transfer or otherwise) if the Holder has delivered written instructions to the Trustee 15 days prior to such payment date requesting that such payment will be so made and designating the bank account to which such payments shall be so made and in the case of payments of Principal, surrenders the same to the Trustee in exchange for a Security or Securities aggregating the same principal amount as the unredeemed principal amount of the Securities surrendered. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the last instruction delivered by the Holder pursuant to this Section 4.01 unless a new instruction is delivered 15 days prior to a payment date. The Company shall indemnify and hold each of the Trustee and any Paying Agent harmless against any loss, liability or expense (including attorneys' fees) resulting from any act or omission to act on the part of the Company or any such Holder in connection with any such agreement or from making any payment in accordance with any such agreement.
 
. . The Company shall maintain an office or agency where Securities of any series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange or for presentation for payment and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of such series and this Indenture may be served. The Company hereby initially designates the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee as such office or agency of the Company. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company fails to maintain any such required office or agency or fails to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee and at the principal London office of the Trustee.
Section 4.02
Maintenance of Office or Agency
The Company shall maintain one or more agencies in a city or cities located outside the United States (including any city in which such an agency is required to be maintained under the rules of any stock exchange on which the Securities of any series are listed) where the Unregistered Securities, if any, of each series and coupons, if any, appertaining thereto may be presented for payment. No payment on any Unregistered Security or coupon shall be made upon presentation of such Unregistered Security or coupon at an agency of the Company within the United States nor shall any payment be made by transfer to an account in, or by mail to an address in, the United States unless, pursuant to applicable United States laws and regulations then in effect, such payment can be made without adverse tax consequences to the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if full payment in United States Dollars ("") at each agency maintained by the Company outside the United States for payment on such Unregistered Securities or coupons appertaining thereto is illegal or effectively precluded by exchange controls or other similar restrictions, payments in Dollars of Unregistered Securities of any series and coupons appertaining thereto which are payable in Dollars may be made at an agency of the Company.

Section 8.10
Qualifying Trustee.
 
. . The Company and the Trustee may, at any time and from time to time, amend the Indenture or the Securities of any series without notice to or the consent of any Holder for any of the following purposes:
Section 9.01
Amendments Without Consent of Holders
(i) to effect the assumption of the Company's obligations under this Indenture by a successor Person;
(ii) to impose additional covenants and events of default or to add guaranties of other Persons for the benefit of the Holders;
(iii) to add or change any of the provisions of this Indenture relating to the issuance or exchange of the Securities of such series in registered form, but only if such action does not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of the outstanding Securities of such series or related coupons in any material respect;
(iv) to change or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture, but only if the change or elimination becomes effective when there are no outstanding Securities of any series, or related coupon, which are entitled to the benefit of such provision and as to which such modification would apply;
(v) to secure the Securities of any series;
(vi) to supplement any of the provisions of this Indenture to permit or facilitate the defeasance and discharge of the Securities of any series, but only if such action does not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of outstanding Securities of any series or related coupons in any material respect;
(vii) to establish the form or terms of the Securities of any series and coupons, if any, of any Securities of such series as permitted by this Indenture;
(viii) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by a successor Trustee and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture to facilitate the administration of the trusts by more than one Trustee; and
(ix) to correct any mistakes or defects in this Indenture, but only if such action does not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of outstanding Securities or related coupons in any material respect or otherwise amend this Indenture in any respect that does not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of outstanding Securities or related coupons.
 
. . (a) The Company and the Trustee may amend the Indenture and the Securities of any series, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities affected by such modification, to add, change or eliminate any provision of, or to modify the rights of such Holders under, the Indenture.
Section 9.02
Amendments with Consent of Holders
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), without the consent of each Holder of outstanding Securities of any series affected, an amendment or waiver may not
(i) change the stated maturity of the principal of, or any installment of interest on, the Securities of any series (or related coupon), reduce the principal amount thereof, the interest thereon or any premium payable upon redemption thereof or change the currency or currencies in which the principal, premium or interest is denominated or payable;
(ii) reduce the amount of, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of, any payment on the Securities of any series following maturity thereof;
(iii) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of any series required for consent to any waiver of defaults or compliance with the provisions of this Indenture with respect to such series; or
(iv) modify any provision of this Indenture relating to modifications and waivers of defaults and covenants, except to increase any such percentage or to provide that certain other provisions cannot be modified or waived without the consent of each Holder of outstanding Securities affected thereby.
A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series or of the coupons appertaining to such Securities.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of any Holder under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
An amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section shall become effective on receipt by the Trustee of written consents from the Holders of the requisite percentage in principal amount of the outstanding Securities affected
 
thereby. After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 becomes effective, the Company shall give to the Holders affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. The Company shall mail supplemental indentures to Holders upon request. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture or waiver.
. . Until an amendment or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the Security of the consenting Holder, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Security. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to its Security or portion of its Security. Such revocation shall be effective only if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver shall become effective with respect to any Securities affected thereby on receipt by the Trustee of written consents from the requisite Holders of outstanding Securities affected thereby.
Section 9.03
Revocation and Effect of Consent
The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date (which may be not less than five nor more than 60 days prior to the solicitation of consents) for the purpose of determining the Holders of the Securities of any series affected entitled to consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver. If a record date is fixed, then, notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were such Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies) and only those Persons shall be entitled to consent to such amendment, supplement or waiver or to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be such Holders after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days after such record date.
After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective with respect to the Securities of any series affected thereby, it shall bind every Holder of such Securities unless it is of the type described in Section 9.02, in which case the amendment or waiver shall bind each such Holder who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Security that evidences the same indebtedness as the Security of the consenting Holder.
. . If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of any Security, the Trustee may require the Holder thereof to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security about the changed terms and return it to the Holder and the Trustee may place an appropriate notation on any Security of such series thereafter authenticated. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security of the same series and tenor that reflects the changed terms.
Section 9.04
Notation on or Exchange of Securities
 
. . The Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article 9 is authorized or permitted by this Indenture, stating that all requisite consents have been obtained or that no consents are required and stating that such supplemental indenture constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to customary exceptions. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, execute any such amendment, supplement or waiver that affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
Section 9.05
Trustee to Sign Amendments, Etc
. . Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article 9 shall conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act.
Section 9.06
Conformity With Trust Indenture Act
This Indenture shall incorporate and be governed by the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act that are required to be part of and to govern indentures qualified under the Trust Indenture Act. Failure of the Company to comply with Section 314(a) of the Trust Indenture Act shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default.

. . In any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified Person, it is not necessary that all such matters be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such Person, or that they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents.

(b) In the event that (i) the Company determines that the Exchange Offer Registration provided for in Section 2(a) above is not available or the Exchange Offer may not be completed as soon as practicable after the last Exchange Date because it would violate any applicable law or applicable interpretations of the Staff, (ii) the Exchange Offer is not for any other reason completed by November 12, 2007, (iii) in the case of any Holder that participates in the Exchange Offer, such Holder does not receive Exchange Securities on the date of the exchange that may be sold without restriction under state and federal securities laws (other than due solely to the status of such Holder as an affiliate of the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or as a broker-dealer) or (iv) the Company so elects, the Company shall (1) promptly deliver to the Holders written notice thereof and (2) at the Company's sole expense, (a) file, as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than 45 days after so required hereby), a Shelf Registration Statement providing for the sale of all the Registrable Securities by the Holders thereof and (b) use the Company's reasonable best efforts to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act.
The Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective until the expiration of the period referred to in Rule 144(k) (or any similar rule then in force, but not Rule 144A) under the Securities Act with respect to the Registrable Securities or such shorter period that will terminate when all the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement (the "Shelf Effectiveness Period"). The Company further agrees to supplement or amend the Shelf Registration Statement, the related Prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus if required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such
 
Shelf Registration Statement or by the Securities Act or by any other rules and regulations thereunder or if reasonably requested by a Holder of Registrable Securities with respect to information relating to such Holder, and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such amendment to become effective, if required, and such Shelf Registration Statement, Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus, as the case may be, to become usable as soon as thereafter practicable. The Company agrees to furnish to the Holders of Registrable Securities copies of any such supplement or amendment promptly after its being used or filed with the SEC.
(c) The Company shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with any registration pursuant to Section 2(a) or Section 2(b) hereof. Each Holder shall pay all underwriting discounts and commissions, brokerage commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of such Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement.
(d) An Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC. A Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC or is automatically effective upon filing with the SEC as provided in Rule 462 under the Securities Act.
If, with respect to any series of Securities: (i) neither the Exchange Offer Registration Statement nor the Shelf Registration Statement is filed with the SEC on or prior to August 14, 2007, (ii) no Shelf Registration Statement has been filed and the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not declared effective on or prior to October 13, 2007, or (iii) the Exchange Offer is not consummated and the Shelf Registration Statement is not declared effective on or prior to November 12, 2007, then a special interest premium (the "Special Interest Premium") will accrue in respect of such series of the Securities from and including the next calendar day following each of (a) August 14, 2007 in the case of clause (i) above, (b) October 13, 2007 in the case of clause (ii) above, and (c) November 12, 2007 in the case of clause (iii) above, in each case at a rate equal to 0.25% per annum. If, with respect to any series of Securities, the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not declared effective on or prior to October 13, 2007 and the Company requests Holders of the Registrable Securities of such series to provide the information called for hereby for inclusion in the Shelf Registration Statement, the Registrable Securities of such series owned by Holders who do not deliver such information to the Company when required hereby will not be entitled to any such increase in the interest rate for any day after October 13, 2007. With respect to a series of Securities, upon (1) the filing of an Exchange Offer Registration Statement or a Shelf Registration Statement after August 14, 2007, (2) the effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or the filing of such Shelf Registration Statement after October 13, 2007 or (3) the consummation of the Exchange Offer or the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration
 
Statement, as the case may be, after November 12, 2007, the interest rate on the Registrable Securities of such series from the day of such filing, effectiveness or consummation, as the case may be, will be reduced to the original interest rate for the Registrable Securities for such series.
If the Shelf Registration Statement, if required hereby, has become effective and thereafter either ceases to be effective or the Prospectus contained therein ceases to be usable, in each case whether or not permitted by this Agreement, at any time during the Shelf Effectiveness Period, and such failure to remain effective or usable exists for more than 120 days (whether or not consecutive) in any 12-month period, then the interest rate on the Registrable Securities of each affected series will be increased by 0.25% per annum commencing on the 121
st
day in such 12-month period and ending on such date that (i) the Shelf Registration Statement has again become effective or the Prospectus again becomes usable, (ii) the date that is the second anniversary of the date hereof (or, if Rule 144(k) is amended to provide a shorter restrictive period, such shorter period) or (iii) the date as of which all of the Registrable Securities are sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement.
(e) Without limiting the remedies available to the Initial Purchasers and the Holders, the Company acknowledges that any failure by the Company to comply with its obligations under Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof may result in material irreparable injury to the Initial Purchasers or the Holders for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it may not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Initial Purchasers or any Holder may seek to obtain such relief as may be required to specifically enforce the obligations of the Company under Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof.
(f) It is acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall be entitled to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement through the use of one or more Registration Statements; that the Company shall not be entitled to use more than one Registration Statement for each series of Securities.

(x) in the case of a Shelf Registration, upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 3(a)(vi)(5) hereof, use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a supplement or post-effective amendment to such Shelf Registration Statement or the related Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered (or, to the extent permitted by law, made available) to purchasers of the Registrable Securities, such Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus, as the case may be, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and the Company shall notify the Holders of Registrable Securities to suspend use of the Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus as promptly as practicable after the occurrence of such an event, and such Holders hereby agree to suspend use of the Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus, as the case may be, until the Company has amended or supplemented the Prospectus or the Free Writing Prospectus, as the case may be, to correct such misstatement or omission;

(xiv) in the case of a Shelf Registration, make available for inspection by any Underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement, any attorneys and accountants designated by Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities of each series to be included in such Shelf Registration and any attorneys and accountants designated by such Underwriter, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, all pertinent financial and other records, documents and properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, and cause the officers, directors and employees of the Company to supply all information reasonably requested by any such Underwriter, attorney or accountant in connection with a Shelf Registration Statement; if any such information is identified by the Company as being confidential or proprietary, each Person receiving such information shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary to protect the confidentiality of such information to the extent such action is otherwise not inconsistent with, an impairment of or in derogation of the rights and interests of any Inspector, Holder or Underwriter;

offerings and confirm the same if and when requested, (2) obtain opinions of counsel to the Company (which counsel and opinions, in form, scope and substance, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Holders and such Underwriters and their respective counsel) addressed to each selling Holder and Underwriter of Registrable Securities, covering the matters customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings, (3) obtain "comfort" letters from the independent certified public accountants of the Company (and, if necessary, any other certified public accountant of any subsidiary of the Company or of any business acquired by the Company for which financial statements and financial data are or are required to be included in the Registration Statement) addressed to each selling Holder (to the extent permitted by applicable professional standards) and Underwriter of Registrable Securities, such letters to be in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "comfort" letters in connection with underwritten offerings, including but not limited to financial information contained in any preliminary prospectus, Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus and (4) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Registrable Securities of each series being sold or the Underwriters, and which are customarily delivered in underwritten offerings, to evidence the continued validity of the representations and warranties of the Company made pursuant to clause (1) above and to evidence compliance with any customary conditions contained in an underwriting agreement.
(b) In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Company may require each Holder of Registrable Securities to furnish to the Company such information regarding such Holder and the proposed disposition by such Holder of such Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing.
(c) In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, each Holder of Registrable Securities covered in such Shelf Registration Statement agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(a)(vi)(3) or 3(a)(vi)(5) hereof, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus contemplated by Section 3(a)(x) hereof and, if so directed by the Company such Holder will deliver to the Company all copies in its possession, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities that is current at the time of receipt of such notice.

Participation of Broker-Dealers in Exchange Offer
The Company understands that it is the Staff's position that if the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement includes a plan of distribution containing a statement to the above effect and the means by which Participating Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange Securities, without naming the Participating Broker-Dealers or specifying the amount of Exchange Securities owned by them, such Prospectus may be delivered by Participating Broker-Dealers (or, to the extent permitted by law, made available to purchasers) to satisfy their prospectus delivery obligation under the Securities Act in connection with resales of Exchange Securities for their own accounts, so long as the Prospectus otherwise meets the requirements of the Securities Act.
(b) In light of the above, and notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, to the extent required by the applicable rules of the SEC, the Company agrees to amend or supplement the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement for a period of not less than 90 days after the last Exchange Date (as such period may be extended pursuant to Section 3(d) of this Agreement), in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of any Exchange Securities by Participating Broker-Dealers consistent with the positions of the Staff recited in Section 4(a) above. The Company further agrees that Participating Broker-Dealers shall be authorized to deliver such Prospectus (or, to the extent permitted by law, make available) during such period in connection with the resales contemplated by this Section 4.
 
(c) The Initial Purchasers shall have no liability to the Company or any Holder with respect to any request that they may make pursuant to Section 4(b) above.
5. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser and each Holder, their respective affiliates, directors and officers and each Person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser or any Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, (1) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or (2) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" ("Issuer Information") filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Initial Purchaser or information relating to any Holder furnished to the Company in writing through any Initial Purchaser or any selling Holder, respectively, expressly for use therein. In connection with any Underwritten Offering permitted by Section 3, the Company will also indemnify the Underwriters, if any participating in the distribution, their respective affiliates and each Person who controls such Persons (within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Holders, if requested in connection with any Registration Statement, any Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or any Issuer Information.
Indemnification and Contribution
(b) Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Initial Purchasers and the other selling Holders, the directors of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls the Company, any Initial Purchaser and any other selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement, any Prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus.
 
(c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any Person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such Person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 5 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 5. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm (x) for any Initial Purchaser, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control Persons of such Initial Purchaser shall be designated in writing by the Initial Purchasers, (y) for any Holder, its directors and officers and any control Persons of such Holder shall be designated in writing by the Majority Holders and (z) in all other cases shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person
provided that
provided, further
 
from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company from the offering of the Securities and the Exchange Securities, on the one hand, and by the Holders from receiving Securities or Exchange Securities registered under the Securities Act, on the other hand, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Holders on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Holders on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Holders and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e) The Company and the Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5 were determined by allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable
pro rata
 
by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, in no event shall a Holder be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities or Exchange Securities sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section (5) are several and not joint.
(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
(g) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 6 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers or any Holder or any Person controlling any Initial Purchaser or any Holder, or by or on behalf of the Company or the officers or directors of or any Person controlling the Company (iii) acceptance of any of the Exchange Securities and (iv) any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement.
6. .
General
(a) The Company represents, warrants and agrees that (i) the rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of any other outstanding securities issued or guaranteed by the Company under any other agreement and (ii) neither the Company has entered into, or on or after the date of this Agreement will enter into, any agreement that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable Securities in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.
No Inconsistent Agreements.
(b) The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given unless the Company has obtained the written consent of Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of each series of the outstanding Registrable Securities affected by such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent; no amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent to any departure from the provisions of Section 5
Amendments and Waivers.
