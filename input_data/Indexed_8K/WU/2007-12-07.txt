On December 4, 2007, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of The Western Union Company (the "Company") approved amendments to Article II, Sections 2 and 5 of the Company's By-laws (the "By-laws") to change the vote standard for the election of directors from plurality to a majority of votes cast in uncontested elections. A majority of the votes cast means that the number of votes cast "for" a director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that director's election, with "abstentions" and "broker nonvotes" not counted as a vote cast either "for" or "against" that director's election. In contested elections where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the vote standard will continue to be a plurality of votes cast.
In addition, if a nominee who already serves as a director is not elected and no successor has been elected at such meeting, the director shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Corporate Governance Committee or another committee designated by the Board will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the decision within 90 days following certification of the election results. The director who tenders his or her resignation shall not participate in the recommendation of the committee or the decision of the Board with respect to his or her resignation. If such incumbent director's resignation is not accepted by the Board, such director shall continue to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal. If the Board accepts a director's resignation, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy or decrease the size of the Board.
The By-laws were also amended, among other things, to allow the directors to act by electronic transmission and to make mandatory the prepayment by the Company of actual and reasonable expenses incurred by officers and employees of the Company in defending certain litigation and proceedings in advance of the final disposition of such litigation or proceedings if certain conditions are met. Prior to the amendment, the advancement of expenses to officers and employees of the Company was discretionary on the part of the Board.
The amended By-laws are effective as of December 4, 2007. The foregoing summary of the amended By-laws does not purport to be a complete description thereof and the summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the amended By-laws which are attached as Exhibit 3.1(ii) to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
The following is a list of the Exhibits furnished herewith.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

. . Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of a majority of the capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented.

Such votes may be cast in person or by proxy but no proxy shall be voted on or after three years from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period.

Section 5
Voting
In all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders.
Each director shall be elected by the vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to that director's election at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. However, if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. A majority of votes cast in an election of directors shall mean that the number of votes cast "for" a director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that director's election (with "abstentions" and "broker nonvotes" not counted as a vote cast either "for" or "against" that director's election).
If a nominee for director, who is an incumbent director, is not elected, the director shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. The Corporate Governance Committee, or such other committee designated by the Board of Directors, shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the resignation of such incumbent director, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors shall act on the resignation, taking into account the committee's
 
recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Securities Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the decision within 90 days following certification of the election results. The director who tenders his or her resignation shall not participate in the recommendation of the committee or the decision of the Board of Directors with respect to his or her resignation. If such incumbent director's resignation is not accepted by the Board of Directors, such director shall continue to serve until the next annual meeting and until his or her successor is duly elected or his or her earlier resignation or removal.
If the Board of directors accepts a director's resignation pursuant to this Section 5, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, the Board of Directors may fill the resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Article III, Section 2 or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Article III, Section 1 of these By-Laws.
. . The officer of the Corporation who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, the list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder of the Corporation who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder of the Corporation during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.

Indemnity if Successful on the Merits
