FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
The Western Union Company (NYSE:WU) (the "company") announced today that it has determined the total exchange price for its outstanding 5.400% notes due 2011 (the "old notes") in connection with its offer to exchange up to $500 million aggregate principal amount of its old notes for a new series of notes due April 1, 2020 (the "new notes").

ENGLEWOOD, CO  March 25, 2010 
The total exchange price for each $1,000 principal amount of old notes tendered and accepted for exchange, using a yield of 1.052%, will be $1,070.10 principal amount of new notes. The new notes will bear interest from the settlement date, which is expected to be Tuesday, March 30, 2010, at a rate per annum equal to 5.253%.
Holders who exchange their old notes will also receive accrued and unpaid interest on the old notes to, but not including, the settlement date and cash in lieu of any fractional amounts of new notes which result from the application of the total exchange price.
As outlined in the company's press release dated March 16, 2010, the condition that at least $250 million aggregate principal amount of the old notes be validly tendered for exchange and not validly withdrawn has been satisfied. Pursuant to the terms of the exchange offer, the company will only accept for exchange old notes in an aggregate principal amount up to $500 million on a pro rata basis among the tendering holders.
The exchange offer is scheduled to expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on March 29, 2010, unless extended.
The exchange offer is only being made, and copies of the exchange offer documents are only being made available to, holders of old notes who have certified to the company in an eligibility letter as to certain matters, including their status as either "qualified institutional buyers," as that term is defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or persons other than "U.S. persons," as that term is defined in Rule 902 under the Securities Act (collectively, "qualified holders").
