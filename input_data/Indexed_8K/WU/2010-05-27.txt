Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On May 25, 2010, the Board of Directors of the Western Union Company (the "Company") approved a multi-phase proposal (the "Restructuring Plan") designed to improve the Company's business processes and to leverage its cost structure. The Restructuring Plan contemplates the reduction of the Company's overall headcount and the migration and consolidation of positions from various facilities, primarily within the United States and Europe, to regionalized operating centers. If implemented as proposed, approximately 175 positions will be eliminated and approximately 550 positions will be migrated and consolidated. If implemented as proposed, the Company expects to incur approximately $75 million of costs related to the Restructuring Plan consisting of approximately $55 million for severance and employee related benefits, approximately $10 million for facility closures, and approximately $10 million for other expenses. Included in estimated expenses are approximately $2 million of non-cash expenses related to fixed asset and leasehold improvement write-offs and accelerated depreciation at impacted facilities. Subject to complying with and undertaking the necessary individual and collective employee information and consultation obligations as may be required by local law for potentially affected employees, the Company expects all of these activities and associated expenses to occur over the next 18 months and to be completed by December, 2011 with a significant majority of these costs expected to be incurred in the Company's fiscal year ended December 31, 2010. The Company expects the total Restructuring Plan costs of approximately $75 million to be offset by annual expense savings of approximately $50 million beginning in 2012, following completion of the Restructuring Plan as currently anticipated. The foregoing figures are the Company's estimates and are subject to change as the proposed Restructuring Plan is implemented and the employee information and consultation process is undertaken.
Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On May 26, 2010, as part of the Restructuring Plan, the Company notified Ranjana Clark that her position with the Company would be eliminated and that her employment would cease on June 30, 2010. Upon her departure, Ms. Clark will be eligible for benefits under the Company's existing Severance / Change in Control Policy (Executive Committee Level), which are described in the Company's 2010 Proxy Statement.
