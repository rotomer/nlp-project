Non-GAAP Measures
Western Union presents a number of non-GAAP measurements because management believes that these metrics provide meaningful supplemental information in addition to the GAAP metrics and provide comparability and consistency to prior periods. These non-GAAP measurements include revenue change constant currency adjusted, revenue change constant currency adjusted excluding Custom House, consumer-to-consumer segment revenue change constant currency adjusted and Global Business Payments segment revenue change excluding Custom House.
Reconciliations of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures are available in the accompanying schedules and in the "Investor Relations" section of the company's web site at .
www.westernunion.com
Currency
Constant currency results assume foreign revenues and expenses are translated from foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, at rates consistent with those in the prior year. Constant currency results also assume any benefit or loss caused by foreign exchange fluctuations between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, would have been consistent with the prior year. Additionally, the measurement assumes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency derivatives not designated as hedges and the portion of fair value that is excluded from the measure of effectiveness for those contracts designated as hedges is consistent with the prior year.

Western Union's management believes the non-GAAP measures presented provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results to assist management, investors, analysts, and others in understanding our financial results and to better analyze trends in our underlying business, because they provide consistency and comparability to prior periods.
A non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP financial measure. A non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, provide a more complete understanding of our business. Users of the financial statements are encouraged to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included below.
All adjusted year-over-year changes were calculated using prior year reported amounts.
All amounts for third quarter 2010 have been estimated. Final third quarter results will be released after market close on October 26, 2010.

MAJOR PAIN POINTS
Transaction ordering process through banks can be cumbersome and lengthy, with poor customer service.
Cross-border payments pass through several intermediaries, causing delays in delivery. Numerous handoffs drive high error rate in processing actual payments.

HOW CUSTOM HOUSE SOLVES THEM
A global network of branches dedicated to exceptional customer service Same-day notification, next-day delivery: experts in payment delivery Online channel with intuitive customer interface: 24/7 global service Network of domestic bank accounts in 34 countries: process transactions directly
 
TYPICAL TRANSACTION REVENUE STRUCTURE

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP
TO GAAP MEASURES
 
Western Union's management believes the non-GAAP measures presented provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results to assist management, investors, analysts, and others in understanding our financial results and to better analyze trends in our underlying business, because they provide consistency and comparability to prior periods. A non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP financial measure. A non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, provide a more complete understanding of our business. Users of the financial statements are encouraged to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included below. All adjusted year-over-year changes were calculated using prior year reported amounts. All amounts for third quarter 2010 have been estimated. Final third quarter results will be released after market close on October 26, 2010.

Non-GAAP related notes:
(a) Represents the impact from the fluctuation in exchange rates between all foreign currency denominated amounts and the United States dollar. Constant currency results exclude any benefit or loss caused by foreign exchange fluctuations between foreign currencies and the United States dollar, net of foreign currency hedges, which would not have occurred if there had been a constant exchange rate.
(b) Represents the incremental impact from the acquisition of Custom House on Global Business Payments segment revenue.
(c) Accrual for an agreement to resolve the Company's disputes with the State of Arizona and certain other states and to fund a multi-state not-for-profit organization focused on border safety and security ("settlement accrual"). This item has been included in the selling, general and administrative expense line of the consolidated statements of income, and was not allocated to the segments.
