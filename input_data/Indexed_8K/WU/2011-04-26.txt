Additional Statistics
Additional key statistics for the quarter and historical trends can be found in the supplemental table included with this press release.
, "The first quarter results demonstrate the benefits of our diversified business, with presence in more than 200 countries and territories. Strong revenue growth in Asia Pacific and solid increases in the Americas and much of Europe helped deliver another good quarter. Our U.S. domestic money transfer growth trends continued, bill payments revenue declines slowed, and Western Union Business Solutions provided strong growth."
Western Union President and Chief Executive Officer Hikmet Ersek said
Ersek continued, "Progress continued with our other strategic initiatives of expanding electronic channels and developing our product portfolio. We recently signed agreements to add on-line banking money transfer to our suite of services offered by US Bank, which is our first such agreement with a Top 10 bank in the U.S., and with Emirates NBD Bank in the UAE. We further developed our mobile money transfer capabilities across the world with new agreements in the Middle East and Africa and enablement of more agent locations for cash to mobile service. In prepaid, we have exceeded one million cards in force in the U.S., and will be introducing prepaid products in some international markets this year."
Ersek added, "We deployed capital constructively in the quarter, as we repurchased $525 million of shares. Last week we completed the acquisition of one of our leading money transfer network agents in Europe, Angelo Costa S.r.l. This acquisition will allow us to more directly access our network locations, more quickly introduce new products and services, and gain scale benefits on costs by leveraging existing European infrastructure. Our business model continues to generate strong cash flow, which we plan to invest back in the business, utilize for strategic acquisitions to aid our growth strategies, and return to shareholders through stock repurchase and dividends."

Non-GAAP Measures
Western Union presents a number of non-GAAP measurements because management believes that these metrics provide meaningful supplemental information in addition to the GAAP metrics and provide comparability and consistency to prior periods. These non-GAAP measurements include revenue change constant currency adjusted, operating income margin and earnings per share excluding restructuring expenses, consumer-to-consumer segment revenue change constant currency adjusted, 2011 earnings per share outlook excluding restructuring expenses, 2011 operating income margin outlook excluding restructuring expenses, and additional measures found in the supplemental schedule included with this press release.
Reconciliations of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures are available in the accompanying schedules and in the "Investor Relations" section of the company's web site at .

Restructuring
Western Union incurred $24 million in restructuring expenses in the first quarter from previously announced actions. Approximately $7 million was included in cost of services and $17 million was included in selling, general, and administrative expense. The Company did not incur any restructuring expenses in the first quarter of 2010.
For the 2010 full year, Western Union incurred $60 million in restructuring expenses from previously announced actions. Approximately $15 million was included in cost of services and $45 million was included in selling, general, and administrative expense.
The Company expects to record a total of approximately $50 million of restructuring charges in 2011. The restructuring charges relate primarily to organizational changes designed to simplify business processes, move decision-making closer to the marketplace, and leverage the cost structure. The Company realized pre-tax savings from the initiatives of $8 million in 2010, and expects approximately $50 million of savings in 2011, and $70 million annualized beginning in 2012. Restructuring expenses are not reflected in segment operating results.
Restructuring expenses include expenses related to severance, outplacement and other related benefits; facility closure and migration of IT infrastructure; and other expenses related to relocation of various operations to new or existing company facilities and
 
third-party providers, including hiring, training, relocation, travel, and professional fees. Also included in the facility closure expenses are non-cash expenses related to fixed asset and leasehold improvement write-offs, and the acceleration of depreciation and amortization.
Currency
Constant currency results assume foreign revenues and expenses are translated from foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, at rates consistent with those in the prior year. Constant currency results also assume any benefit or loss caused by foreign exchange fluctuations between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, would have been consistent with the prior year. Additionally, the measurement assumes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency derivatives not designated as hedges and the portion of fair value that is excluded from the measure of effectiveness for those contracts designated as hedges is consistent with the prior year.

Western Union's management believes the non-GAAP measures presented provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results to assist management, investors, analysts, and others in understanding our financial results and to better analyze trends in our underlying business, because they provide consistency and comparability to prior periods.
A non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP financial measure. A non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, provide a more complete understanding of our business. Users of the financial statements are encouraged to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included below.
All adjusted year-over-year changes were calculated using prior year reported amounts.
