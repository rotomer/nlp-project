This Current Report on Form 8-K/A is being filed as an amendment ("Amendment No. 1") to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by The Western Union Company (the "Company") with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 24, 2011 (the "Original Filing"). The sole purpose of this Amendment No. 1 is to disclose the Company's decision regarding how frequently it will conduct future stockholder advisory votes regarding executive compensation. No other changes are being made to the Original Filing.
 
As previously reported, in an advisory vote on the frequency of the advisory vote on executive compensation held at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company on Friday, May 20, 2011, 482,925,716 shares voted for one year, 1,606,134 shares voted for two years, 43,339,465 shares voted for 3 years, 203,930 shares abstained from voting, and there were 32,996,904 broker non-votes.
In light of these voting results and other factors, the Company's Board of Directors, at its meeting held July 22, 2011, determined that the Company will hold an annual advisory vote on executive compensation, until the next required vote on the frequency of the stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
