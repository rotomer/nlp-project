"Our business continues to demonstrate its resilience, with revenue growth in each of our major regions and businesses. Consumer-to-consumer trends remained solid, bill payments revenue grew for the second consecutive quarter, and business-to-business payments delivered very strong results, with reported revenue growth of 30%. We are on track to deliver our revenue and earnings per share outlook for the year."
Western Union President and Chief Executive Officer Hikmet Ersek commented,
Ersek continued, "Our electronic channel strategic initiatives continue to move forward, with revenue growth of 40% in the quarter. We now have money transfer service available through over 30,000 ATMs in Europe and Asia, and have signed over 70 banks for account based money transfer, including most recently La Banque Postale in France."
Ersek added, "In the quarter we also announced the formation of a new business unit structure to align with our key growth strategies. Global Consumer Financial Services consists of our core money transfer services and consumer bill payments and represents most of the Company's revenues today. Western Union Business Solutions includes our existing business-to-business payments services, which will triple in size with the acquisition of Travelex Global Business Payments. Western Union Ventures will focus on developing new service offerings, which will help build deeper relationships with existing and new consumers. Currently, Ventures includes Westernunion.com, prepaid, and mobile money transfer, but we plan to introduce additional services over time. The business units are now in place, and we are very excited about the long-term opportunities available in each of these strategic areas."

Revenue
 
 
The 2011 outlook does not include any revenue impact related to the TGBP acquisition, which remains on track to close in the fourth quarter.
EPS
 
 
These EPS ranges include a negative $0.02 impact from TGBP deal costs.
Operating Margins
The Company's GAAP operating margin continues to be projected at a range of 25% to 25.5%, or a range of 26% to 26.5% excluding restructuring charges. On a constant currency basis, excluding restructuring charges, the Company projects a full year operating margin of 26.5% to 27%, including the negative impact of TGBP deal costs. This compares to an operating margin of 26.2% in 2010, excluding restructuring charges.
Operating Cash Flow
The Company continues to expect GAAP cash flows from operating activities to be at the lower end of the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion.
Non-GAAP Measures
Western Union presents a number of non-GAAP measurements because management believes that these metrics provide meaningful supplemental information in addition to the GAAP metrics and provide comparability and consistency to prior periods. These non-GAAP measurements include revenue change constant currency adjusted, operating income margin and earnings per share excluding restructuring expenses, consumer-to-consumer segment revenue change constant currency adjusted, 2011 revenue outlook constant currency adjusted, 2011 operating income margin outlook restructuring and constant currency adjusted, 2011 earnings per share outlook restructuring adjusted, and additional measures found in the supplemental schedule included with this press release.
 
Reconciliations of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures are available in the accompanying schedules and in the "Investor Relations" section of the Company's web site at .

Restructuring
Western Union incurred $14 million in restructuring expenses in the third quarter from previously announced actions. Approximately $3 million was included in cost of services and $11 million was included in selling, general, and administrative expense. The Company incurred $14 million in restructuring expenses in the third quarter of 2010.
For the 2010 full year, Western Union incurred $60 million in restructuring expenses from previously announced actions. Approximately $15 million was included in cost of services and $45 million was included in selling, general, and administrative expense.
The Company has recorded a total of $47 million of restructuring charges in 2011. The restructuring charges relate primarily to organizational changes designed to simplify business processes, move decision-making closer to the marketplace, and create operating efficiencies. The Company realized pre-tax savings from the initiatives of $8 million in 2010, and expects approximately $55 million of savings in 2011, and $70 million annualized beginning in 2012. Restructuring expenses are not reflected in segment operating results.
Restructuring expenses include expenses related to severance, outplacement and other related benefits; facility closure and migration of IT infrastructure; and other expenses related to relocation of various operations to new or existing Company facilities and third-party providers, including hiring, training, relocation, travel, and professional fees. Also included in the facility closure expenses are non-cash expenses related to fixed asset and leasehold improvement write-offs, and the acceleration of depreciation and amortization.
As of the end of the 2011 third quarter, all restructuring actions related to these previously announced programs have been completed and all related restructuring expenses have been recorded.
Currency
Constant currency results assume foreign revenues and expenses are translated from foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, at rates consistent with those in the prior year. Constant currency results also assume any benefit or loss caused by foreign exchange fluctuations between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, would have been consistent with the prior year. Additionally, the measurement assumes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency derivatives not designated as hedges and the portion of fair value that is excluded from the measure of effectiveness for those contracts designated as hedges is consistent with the prior year.

Western Union's management believes the non-GAAP measures presented provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results to assist management, investors, analysts, and others in understanding our financial results and to better analyze trends in our underlying business, because they provide consistency and comparability to prior periods.
A non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP financial measure. A non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, provide a more complete understanding of our business. Users of the financial statements are encouraged to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included below.
All adjusted year-over-year changes were calculated using prior year reported amounts.
