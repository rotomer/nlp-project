Western Union Reports Second Quarter Results
Revenue Increases 4%
2012 Full Year Revenue Outlook Affirmed
Increasing EPS Outlook for Tax Benefit
Company Executing Against Strategic Plan
_________________________________________________________
Englewood, Colo., July 24, 2012
- The Western Union Company (NYSE: WU) today reported financial results for the 2012 second quarter.
Financial highlights for the quarter included:
 
Western Union President and Chief Executive Officer Hikmet Ersek commented,
Overall we are on track for our full year financial outlook. In the quarter, our core consumer money transfer business, which represents over 80% of Company revenue, delivered solid 3% constant currency growth with consistent margins. The Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific, and Latin America regions and on-line money transfer performed well, more than offsetting the impact of consumer slowdowns in Southern Europe and some expected softness in certain countries. The global diversification of our portfolio and resiliency of our consumers continue to drive revenue growth and strong cash flow, even in a challenging economic environment.
Ersek continued, We continue to invest for the future to support our strategic growth areas of Global Consumer Financial Services, Business Solutions, and Ventures. We are further expanding our consumer network, and now have 510,000 agent locations across the world. Business Solutions global expansion is on track and new customer acquisition is strong. In Ventures, our westernunion.com on-line money transfer service continues to deliver strong growth while we develop new capabilities, and our prepaid business will soon benefit from a significant increase in distribution points in the U.S.
Ersek added, The long-term opportunities are strong, and we believe in our growth strategies for the future. Our business continues to generate significant free cash flow, and we have returned over $430 million to shareholders through the combination of share repurchase and dividends in the first half of the year. We remain committed to strong cash deployment for our shareholders.
Additional highlights for the quarter included:
Additional Statistics
Additional key statistics for the quarter and historical trends can be found in the supplemental tables included with this press release.
2012 Outlook
The Company affirms its full year 2012 revenue and EBITDA margin outlook provided on April 24, and has increased its earnings per share outlook, primarily due to the tax benefit recorded in the second quarter. The Company has reduced its operating margin outlook due to increased compliance related costs; reduced its Business Solutions revenue outlook; and increased its outlook for cash flow from operations due to timing of tax payments.
The Company now expects the following outlook for 2012:
Revenue
Operating Margins
Tax Rate
Earnings Per Share
Cash Flow from Operations
Non-GAAP Measures
Western Union presents a number of non-GAAP financial measures because management believes that these metrics provide meaningful supplemental information in addition to the GAAP metrics and provide comparability and consistency to prior periods. These non-GAAP financial measures include revenue change constant currency adjusted, pro forma revenue change TGBP and constant currency adjusted, operating income margin excluding restructuring expense, operating income margin excluding restructuring and TGBP integration expense, EBITDA margin excluding restructuring and TGBP integration expense, earnings per share restructuring and TGBP integration expense adjusted, Consumer-to-Consumer segment revenue change constant currency adjusted, Consumer-to-Business segment revenue change constant currency adjusted, Business Solutions segment pro forma revenue change TGBP and constant currency adjusted, 2012 revenue change outlook constant currency adjusted, 2012 operating income margin outlook TGBP integration expense adjusted, 2012 EBITDA margin outlook TGBP integration expense adjusted, 2012 earnings per share outlook TGBP integration expense adjusted, 2012 operating cash flow outlook IRS Agreement adjusted, and additional measures found in the supplemental schedule included with this press release.
Reconciliations of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures are available in the accompanying schedules and in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at
www.westernunion.com
.
EBITDA
Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) results from taking operating income and adjusting for depreciation and amortization expenses. The 2012 EBITDA has been adjusted to exclude TGBP integration expense, and the 2011 EBITDA has been adjusted to exclude restructuring expenses and TGBP integration expense. EBITDA results provide an additional performance measurement calculation which helps neutralize the income statement effect of assets acquired in prior periods.
TGBP Integration
The Company expects approximately $50 million of integration expense for TGBP in 2012, of which approximately $14 million was incurred in the second quarter. TGBP integration expense consists primarily of severance and other benefits, retention, direct and incremental expense consisting of facility relocation, consolidation and closures; IT systems integration; amortization of a transitional trademark license; and other expenses such as training, travel, and professional fees. Integration expense does not include costs related to the completion of the TGBP acquisition.
Restructuring
The Company did not incur any restructuring expenses in the second quarter of 2012. The Company recorded $9 million of restructuring charges in the second quarter of 2011. Approximately $0.5 million was included in cost of services and $8.4 million was included in selling, general, and administrative expense. The restructuring charges relate primarily to organizational changes designed to simplify business processes, move decision-making closer to the marketplace, and create operating efficiencies. The Company realized pre-tax savings from the initiatives of approximately $55 million in 2011, and expects $70 million annualized beginning in 2012. Restructuring expenses are not reflected in segment operating results.
Restructuring expenses include expenses related to severance, outplacement and other related benefits; facility closure and migration of IT infrastructure; and other expenses related to relocation of various operations to new or existing Company facilities and third-party providers, including hiring, training, relocation, travel, and professional fees. Also included in the facility closure expenses are non-cash expenses related to fixed asset and leasehold improvement write-offs, and the acceleration of depreciation and amortization.
Currency
Constant currency results assume foreign revenues and expenses are translated from foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, at rates consistent with those in the prior year. Constant currency results also assume any benefit or loss caused by foreign exchange fluctuations between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, would have been consistent with the prior year. Additionally, the measurement assumes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency derivatives not designated as hedges and the portion of fair value that is excluded from the measure of effectiveness for those contracts designated as hedges is consistent with the prior year.

Footnote explanations 27 Non-GAAP related notes: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) Represents the estimated impact from the fluctuation in exchange rates between all foreign currency denominated amounts and the United States dollar. Constant currency results exclude any estimated benefit or loss caused by foreign exchange fluctuations between foreign currencies and the United States dollar, net of foreign currency hedges, which would not have occurred if there had been a constant exchange rate. Represents the impact from the tax benefit in December 2011 due to the agreement with the IRS resolving substantially all issues related to the restructuring of our international operations in 2003 of $204.7 million. The Company made tax payments of approximately $100 million through the second quarter of 2012 and expects to pay the majority of the remaining tax payments of approximately $90 million in 2013. TGBP integration expense consists primarily of severance and other benefits, retention, direct and incremental expense consisting of facility relocation, consolidation and closures; IT systems integration; amortization of a transitional trademark license; and other expenses such as training, travel and professional fees. Integration expense does not include costs related to the completion of the TGBP acquisition. Represents the impact from the fluctuation in exchange rates between all foreign currency denominated amounts and the United States dollar. Constant currency results exclude any benefit or loss caused by foreign exchange fluctuations between foreign currencies and the United States dollar, net of foreign currency hedges, which would not have occurred if there had been a constant exchange rate. In pro forma calculations, also includes the currency impact of $(1.6) million and $(1.3) million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 associated with the acquisition of Travelex Global Business Payments ("TGBP"). Represents the pro forma incremental impact of TGBP on Consolidated and Business Solutions segment revenues. Pro forma revenues presents the results of operations of the Company and its Business Solutions segment as they may have appeared had the acquisition of TGBP occurred as of January 1, 2011. The pro forma information is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to present what the actual results of operations would have been had the acquisition actually occurred on the date indicated. The results of operations for TGBP have been included in Consolidated and Business Solutions segment revenues from November 7, 2011, the date of acquisition. Restructuring and related expenses consist of direct and incremental expenses including the impact from fluctuations in exchange rates associated with restructuring and related activities, consisting of severance, outplacement and other related benefits; facility closure and migration of the Company's IT infrastructure; and other expenses related to the relocation of various operations to new or existing Company facilities and third-party providers, including hiring, training, relocation, travel, and professional fees. Also included in the facility closure expenses are non-cash expenses related to fixed asset and leasehold improvement write-offs and the acceleration of depreciation and amortization. Restructuring and related expenses were not allocated to the segments. Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) results from taking operating income and adjusting for depreciation and amortization expenses.
