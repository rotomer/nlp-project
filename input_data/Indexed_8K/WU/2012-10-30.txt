_________________________________________________________
Englewood, Colo., October 30, 2012
- The Western Union Company (NYSE: WU) today reported financial results for the 2012 third quarter.
Financial highlights for the quarter included:
 
Western Union President and Chief Executive Officer Hikmet Ersek commented,
In the third quarter our revenues increased 1%. Business was challenging, as soft global economic conditions, compliance related changes, and competitive pressures in certain money transfer corridors impacted revenues. Globally, Western Union branded consumer money transfer revenue grew slightly in constant currency terms, with our on-line business once again delivering very good results. We continue to generate strong cash flow, and year-to-date we have now returned over $600 million to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends.
Ersek continued, We are continuing to advance our growth strategies: expanding our network in consumer money transfer; adding on-line and other digital capabilities to attract new consumers; acquiring business customers and expanding geographies in our business-to-business segment; and establishing a global presence in stored value. As we have progressed through 2012, however, the market environment in consumer money transfer has become more difficult, especially in recent months. To better position us for the sustainable growth of this business we are implementing a series of strategic actions, with a focus on enhancing our value proposition, continuing to invest in the fast growing digital channels, and further optimizing our cost structure.
Ersek added, Enhancing our value proposition will include improving the customer experience and accelerating pricing investment in certain corridors. Although these investments will negatively impact short-term financial results, we believe they are the right actions to regain market share momentum and drive long-term revenue and profit growth. Similar initiatives have delivered solid results in the past, such as with our U.S. domestic money transfer repositioning in late 2009.
Ersek added, We remain very confident about the long-term prospects for the business. We are a leader in a growing market in consumer money transfer, and we are taking steps to enhance our position for the future. We will continue to execute our strategies in business-to-business, digital, and stored value. I am also pleased to announce our board of directors has approved a 25% increase in our dividend, to $0.50 per share annually, as well as a new $550 million share repurchase authorization, which gives us the opportunity to repurchase up to approximately $750 million of our shares through the end of 2013.
Strategic Action Plans
The Company is implementing a series of strategic actions focused on three key areas: consumer value proposition, digital channels, and cost optimization.
The Impact of Strategic Actions on 2013 Financial Results.
The strategic action plans are intended to drive immediate transaction increases and long-term revenue and profitability growth, but are anticipated to have a negative impact on 2013 financial results. The 2013 outlook will be highly dependent on the economic environment, the level of pricing actions, and the level of incremental investments. At this time the Company believes 2013 constant currency revenues may decline slightly and GAAP operating income may decline 10% to 15% from 2012 levels, if all actions are implemented as currently contemplated. The Company will provide its 2013 outlook when it releases fourth quarter earnings in February.
Dividend and Share Repurchase Authorization
The Company announced today that its board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per common share, payable December 31, 2012 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 17, 2012. The $0.125 quarterly dividend, which equates to $0.50 annually, represents a 25% increase from the previous quarterly dividend of $0.10 per common share, or $0.40 annually.
The Company also announced that its board of directors approved a new $550 million share repurchase authorization, which expires December 31, 2013. This is in addition to the $194 million remaining as of September 30 under the current authorization, which expires December 31, 2012.
Management Changes
The Company has implemented changes to its management structure to better support its multi-product, multi-channel focus. The changes are intended to improve and expedite customer focused decisions across all products and channels and reduce costs. As part of these changes, Stewart Stockdale, formerly EVP and President, Global Consumer Financial Services, has left the organization. The Company would like to thank Mr. Stockdale for his contributions over the last four years and wish him well in his future endeavors.
2012 Outlook
The Company has updated its full year 2012 revenue, margin, and EPS outlook to reflect lower second half revenue trends. Margins and EPS have also been adjusted to include approximately $30 million of anticipated pre-tax expenses related to new cost savings initiatives.
The Company now expects the following outlook for 2012:
Revenue
Operating Margins
Tax Rate
Earnings Per Share
Cash Flow from Operations
Additional highlights for the 2012 third quarter included:
Additional Statistics
Additional key statistics for the quarter and historical trends can be found in the supplemental tables included with this press release.
Non-GAAP Measures
Western Union presents a number of non-GAAP financial measures because management believes that these metrics provide meaningful supplemental information in addition to the GAAP metrics and provide comparability and consistency to prior periods. These non-GAAP financial measures include revenue change constant currency adjusted, pro forma revenue change TGBP and constant currency adjusted, operating income margin excluding restructuring and TGBP integration expense, EBITDA margin excluding restructuring and TGBP integration expense, earnings per share restructuring and TGBP integration expense adjusted, Consumer-to-Consumer segment revenue change constant currency adjusted, Business Solutions segment pro forma revenue change TGBP and constant currency adjusted, 2012 revenue change outlook constant currency adjusted, 2012 operating income margin outlook TGBP integration expense adjusted, 2012 EBITDA margin outlook TGBP integration expense adjusted, 2012 earnings per share outlook TGBP integration expense adjusted, 2012 operating cash flow outlook IRS Agreement adjusted, and additional measures found in the supplemental schedule included with this press release.
Reconciliations of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures are available in the accompanying schedules and in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at
www.westernunion.com
.
EBITDA
Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) results from taking operating income and adjusting for depreciation and amortization expenses. The 2012 EBITDA has been adjusted to exclude TGBP integration expense, and the 2011 EBITDA has been adjusted to exclude restructuring expenses and TGBP integration expense. EBITDA results provide an additional performance measurement calculation which helps neutralize the operating income effect of assets acquired in prior periods.
TGBP Integration
The Company expects approximately $50 million of integration expense for TGBP in 2012, of which approximately $10 million was incurred in the third quarter. TGBP integration expense consists primarily of severance and other benefits, retention, direct and incremental expense consisting of facility relocation, consolidation and closures; IT systems integration; amortization of a transitional trademark license; and other expenses such as training, travel, and professional fees. Integration expense does not include costs related to the completion of the TGBP acquisition.
Restructuring
The Company did not incur any restructuring expenses in the third quarter of 2012. The Company recorded $14 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter of 2011. Approximately $3 million was included in cost of services and $11 million was included in selling, general, and administrative expense. Restructuring expenses are not reflected in segment operating results.
Restructuring expenses include expenses related to severance, outplacement and other related benefits; facility closure and migration of IT infrastructure; and other expenses related to relocation of various operations to new or existing Company facilities and third-party providers, including hiring, training, relocation, travel, and professional fees. Also included in the facility closure expenses are non-cash expenses related to fixed asset and leasehold improvement write-offs, and the acceleration of depreciation and amortization.
Currency
Constant currency results assume foreign revenues and expenses are translated from foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, at rates consistent with those in the prior year. Constant currency results also assume any benefit or loss caused by foreign exchange fluctuations between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, would have been consistent with the prior year. Additionally, the measurement assumes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency derivatives not designated as hedges and the portion of fair value that is excluded from the measure of effectiveness for those contracts designated as hedges is consistent with the prior year.

Western Unions management believes the non-GAAP financial measures presented provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results to assist management, investors, analysts, and others in understanding our financial results and to better analyze trends in our underlying business, because they provide consistency and comparability to prior periods.
A non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP financial measure. A non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, provide a more complete understanding of our business. Users of the financial statements are encouraged to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included below.
All adjusted year-over-year changes were calculated using prior year reported amounts, unless indicated otherwise.

Non-GAAP Measures 24 Western Union's management believes the non-GAAP financial measures presented provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results to assist management, investors, analysts, and others in understanding our financial results and to better analyze trends in our underlying business, because they provide consistency and comparability to prior periods. These non-GAAP financial measures include revenue change constant currency adjusted, pro forma revenue change TGBP and constant currency adjusted, operating income margin excluding restructuring and TGBP integration expense, EBITDA margin excluding restructuring and TGBP integration expense, earnings per share restructuring and TGBP integration expense adjusted, Consumer-to-Consumer segment revenue change constant currency adjusted, Consumer-to-Consumer segment principal per transaction change constant currency adjusted, Consumer-to-Consumer segment cross-border principal change constant currency adjusted, Consumer-to-Business segment revenue change constant currency adjusted, Business Solutions segment pro forma revenue change TGBP and constant currency adjusted, Business Solutions segment EBITDA margin excluding TGBP integration expense, 2012 revenue change outlook constant currency adjusted, 2012 operating income margin outlook TGBP integration expense adjusted, 2012 EBITDA margin outlook TGBP integration expense adjusted, 2012 earnings per share outlook TGBP integration expense adjusted, and 2012 operating cash flow outlook IRS Agreement adjusted. A non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP financial measure. A non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, provide a more complete understanding of our business. Users of the financial statements are encouraged to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included below. All adjusted year-over-year changes were calculated using prior year reported amounts, unless indicated otherwise. Amounts included below are in millions, unless indicated otherwise.

Footnote explanations 28 Non-GAAP related notes: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) Represents the estimated impact from the fluctuation in exchange rates between all foreign currency denominated amounts and the United States dollar. Constant currency results exclude any estimated benefit or loss caused by foreign exchange fluctuations between foreign currencies and the United States dollar, net of foreign currency hedges, which would not have occurred if there had been a constant exchange rate. Represents the impact from the tax benefit in December 2011 due to the agreement with the IRS resolving substantially all issues related to the restructuring of our international operations in 2003 of $204.7 million. The Company made tax payments of $92.4 million through the third quarter of 2012 and expects to make the majority of the remaining tax payments of approximately $100 million in 2013. TGBP integration expense consists primarily of severance and other benefits, retention, direct and incremental expense consisting of facility relocation, consolidation and closures; IT systems integration; amortization of a transitional trademark license; and other expenses such as training, travel and professional fees. Integration expense does not include costs related to the completion of the TGBP acquisition. Represents the impact from the fluctuation in exchange rates between all foreign currency denominated amounts and the United States dollar. Constant currency results exclude any benefit or loss caused by foreign exchange fluctuations between foreign currencies and the United States dollar, net of foreign currency hedges, which would not have occurred if there had been a constant exchange rate. In pro forma calculations, also includes the currency impact of $(1.6) million and $(2.9) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 associated with the acquisition of Travelex Global Business Payments ("TGBP"). Represents the pro forma incremental impact of TGBP on Consolidated and Business Solutions segment revenues. Pro forma revenues presents the results of operations of the Company and its Business Solutions segment as they may have appeared had the acquisition of TGBP occurred as of January 1, 2011. The pro forma information is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to present what the actual results of operations would have been had the acquisition actually occurred on the date indicated. The results of operations for TGBP have been included in Consolidated and Business Solutions segment revenues from November 7, 2011, the date of acquisition. Restructuring and related expenses consist of direct and incremental expenses including the impact from fluctuations in exchange rates associated with restructuring and related activities, consisting of severance, outplacement and other related benefits; facility closure and migration of the Company's IT infrastructure; and other expenses related to the relocation of various operations to new or existing Company facilities and third-party providers, including hiring, training, relocation, travel, and professional fees. Also included in the facility closure expenses are non-cash expenses related to fixed asset and leasehold improvement write-offs and the acceleration of depreciation and amortization. Restructuring and related expenses were not allocated to the segments. Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) results from taking operating income and adjusting for depreciation and amortization expenses.
