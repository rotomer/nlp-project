WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY (a Washington corporation) UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT STANDARD PROVISIONS (DEBT) (December 12, 2002)
From time to time, Weyerhaeuser Company, a Washington corporation (the "COMPANY"), may enter into one or more underwriting agreements that provide for the sale of designated securities to the several underwriters named therein. The standard provisions set forth herein may be incorporated by reference in any such underwriting agreement (an "UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT"). The Underwriting Agreement, including the provisions incorporated therein by reference, is herein referred to as this "AGREEMENT". Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Underwriting Agreement are used herein as therein defined. I. The Company proposes to issue from time to time debt securities (the "SECURITIES") to be issued pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture dated as of April 1, 1986, as amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of February 15, 1991, the Second Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of February 1, 1993, the Third Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of October 22, 2001, and the Fourth Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of March 12, 2002 (as so amended and supplemented, the "INDENTURE"), each between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank and Chemical Bank), as trustee (the "TRUSTEE"). The Securities will have varying designations, maturities, rates and times of payment of interest, selling prices, redemption terms and other terms. The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "COMMISSION") a registration statement (No. 333-72356) including a prospectus relating to the Securities and has filed or will file with the Commission a prospectus supplement or supplements specifically relating to the Offered Securities pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act of 1933. The term "REGISTRATION STATEMENT" means the registration statement as amended to the date of the Underwriting Agreement. The term "BASIC PROSPECTUS" means the prospectus dated February 8, 2002 relating to the Securities in the form first provided to the Underwriters for use in confirming sales of the Offered Securities. The term "PROSPECTUS" means the Basic Prospectus together with the prospectus supplement (other than a preliminary prospectus supplement) specifically relating to the Offered Securities in the form first provided to the Underwriters for use in confirming sales of the Offered Securities. The term "PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS" means any preliminary form of the Prospectus used in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities. If the Company files an abbreviated registration statement to register Offered Securities pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "RULE 462(B) REGISTRATION STATEMENT), then any reference in this Agreement to the term "Registration Statement" shall be deemed to include such Rule 462(b) Registration Statement. As used herein, the terms "REGISTRATION STATEMENT", "BASIC PROSPECTUS", "PROSPECTUS" and "PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS" shall include, in each case, the materials, if any, incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein. The term "UNDERWRITERS' SECURITIES" means the Offered Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement. The term "CONTRACT SECURITIES" means the Offered Securities, if any, to be purchased pursuant to the delayed delivery contracts referred to below. II. If the Prospectus provides for sales of Offered Securities pursuant to delayed delivery contracts, the Company hereby authorizes the Underwriters to solicit offers to purchase Contract Securities on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Prospectus pursuant to delayed delivery contracts substantially in the form of Schedule I attached hereto ("DELAYED DELIVERY CONTRACTS") but with such changes therein as the Company may authorize or approve. Delayed Delivery Contracts are to be with institutional investors approved by the Company and of the types set forth in the Prospectus. On the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), the Company will pay the Manager as compensation, for the accounts of the Underwriters, the fee set forth in the Underwriting Agreement in respect of the Contract Securities. The Underwriters will not have any responsibility in respect of the validity or the performance of Delayed Delivery Contracts. If the Company executes and delivers Delayed Delivery Contracts with institutional investors, the Contract Securities shall be deducted from the Offered Securities to be purchased by the several Underwriters and the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter shall be reduced pro rata in proportion to the principal amount of Offered Securities set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in the Underwriting Agreement, except to the extent that the Manager determines that such reduction shall be otherwise and so advises the Company. III. The Company is advised by the Manager that the Underwriters propose to make a public offering of their respective portions of the Underwriters' Securities as soon after this Agreement is entered into as in the Manager's judgment is advisable. The terms of the public offering of the Underwriters' Securities are set forth in the Prospectus. IV. Payment for the Underwriters' Securities shall be made in Federal or other immediately available funds in New York City at the time and on the date set forth in the Underwriting Agreement, upon delivery to the Manager for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters of the Underwriters' Securities registered in such names and in such denominations as the Manager shall request in writing not less than one business day prior to the date of delivery. The time and date of such payment and delivery with respect to the Underwriters' Securities are herein referred to as the "CLOSING DATE". V. The several obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement are subject to the following conditions: (a) (i) subsequent to the execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, there shall not have been any downgrading nor any notice given of any intended or potential downgrading, or of a possible change that does not indicate the direction of the possible change, in the rating accorded any of the Company's securities by any 2
"nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933; (ii) subsequent to the execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, there shall not have occurred any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business or operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from that set forth in the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendments or supplements thereto subsequent to the date of the Underwriting Agreement), that, in the judgment of the Manager, is material and adverse and that makes it, in the judgment of the Manager, impracticable to market the Offered Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus; and (iii) the Manager shall have received on the Closing Date a certificate, dated the Closing Date and signed by an executive officer of the Company, to the effect set forth in clause (i) above and to the effect that the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement are true and correct as of the Closing Date and that the Company has complied with all of the agreements and satisfied all of the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied on or before the Closing Date. (b) The Manager shall have received on the Closing Date an opinion of Lorrie D. Scott, Senior Legal Counsel of the Company, or other counsel satisfactory to the Manager, dated the Closing Date, to the effect set forth as Exhibit A. (c) The Manager shall have received on the Closing Date an opinion of Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, dated the Closing Date and in form and substance satisfactory to the Manager, with respect to this Agreement, the Offered Securities, the Indenture, the Delayed Delivery Contracts (if any), the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and such other matters as the Manager may request, it being understood that, in rendering such opinion, such counsel need not express any opinion with respect to matters governed by or arising under the laws of the State of Washington. (d) The Manager shall have received on the Closing Date a letter, dated the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Manager, from KPMG LLP, independent auditors, containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information of the Company and Willamette Industries, Inc. and their respective subsidiaries contained in or incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto. VI. In further consideration of the agreements of the Underwriters contained in this Agreement, the Company covenants as follows: (a) To furnish the Manager, without charge, three signed copies of the Registration Statement including exhibits and materials, if any, incorporated or deemed 3
to be incorporated by reference therein and, during the period mentioned in paragraph (c) below, as many copies of the Prospectus, any documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein and any supplements and amendments thereto as the Manager may reasonably request. The terms "SUPPLEMENT" and "AMENDMENT" or "AMEND" as used in this Agreement with respect to the Registration Statement or Prospectus shall include all documents filed by the Company with the Commission subsequent to the date of the Basic Prospectus, pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Prospectus. (b) Before amending or supplementing the Registration Statement or the Prospectus with respect to the Offered Securities, to furnish the Manager a copy of each such proposed amendment or supplement. (c) If, during such period after the first date of the public offering of the Offered Securities as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters the Prospectus is required by law to be delivered with respect thereto, any event shall occur as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if it is necessary to amend or to supplement the Prospectus to comply with law, forthwith to prepare and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters, either amendments or supplements to the Prospectus so that the statements in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading or so that the Prospectus will comply with law. (d) To qualify the Offered Securities for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Manager shall reasonably request and to pay all expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) in connection with such qualification and in connection with the determination of the eligibility of the Offered Securities for investment under the laws of such jurisdiction as the Manager may designate. (e) To make generally available to the Company's security holders as soon as practicable an earnings statement covering a twelve-month period beginning after the date of the Underwriting Agreement, which shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. (f) During the period beginning on the date of the Underwriting Agreement and continuing to and including the Closing Date not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of the Company substantially similar to the Offered Securities without the prior written consent of the Manager. 4
VII. The Company represents and warrants to each Underwriter that (i) each document, if any, filed or to be filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus complied or will comply, as the case may be, when so filed in all material respects with such Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder, (ii) each part of the Registration Statement (including the documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein) filed with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 relating to the Securities, when such part became effective under the Securities Act of 1933, did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (iii) each preliminary prospectus, if any, filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act of 1933 complied when so filed in all material respects with such Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder, (iv) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus comply and, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, will comply in all material respects with the Securities Act of 1933 and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder and (v) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus do not contain and, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; except that these representations and warranties do not apply to statements or omissions in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus based upon information furnished to the Company in writing by any Underwriter expressly for use therein. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 or Section 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any Underwriter or any such controlling person in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (if used within the period set forth in paragraph (c) of Article VI hereof and as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to the Company by any Underwriter expressly for use therein. Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 or Section 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus. 5
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Manager in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the first preceding paragraph. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. If the indemnification provided for in this Article VII is unavailable to an indemnified party under the second or third paragraphs of this Article VII or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the Total Net Proceeds from the offering of such Offered Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Total Discounts and Commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the Total Offering Price of the Offered Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one 6
hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Article VII were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses (including expenses of local counsel) reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article VII, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten and distributed to the public by such Underwriter were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act of 1933) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Article VII are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Article VII are several, in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Offered Securities purchased by each of such Underwriters, and not joint. The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Article VII and the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its directors or officers or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Offered Securities. VIII. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the Manager's absolute discretion, by notice given to the Company, if (a) after the execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any 7
calamity or crisis that, in the judgment of the Manager, is material and adverse and (b) in the case of any of the events specified in clauses (a) (i) through (iv), such event, singly or together with any other such event, makes it, in the judgment of the Manager, impracticable to market the Offered Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus. IX. If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase the Offered Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase under the Underwriting Agreement on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Offered Securities of each series set forth opposite their names in the Underwriting Agreement pursuant to which the Offered Securities are being purchased bear to the aggregate principal of Offered Securities of the respective series set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Manager may specify, to purchase the Offered Securities of each series which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided, however, that in no event shall the principal amount of Offered Securities which any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to such Underwriting Agreement be increased pursuant to this Article IX by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Offered Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Offered Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Manager and the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case the non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement. If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters or any of them because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement, with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with the Offered Securities. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. 8
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. 9

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Issuer issued under and pursuant to an Indenture dated as of April 1, 1986 (the "Original Indenture"), as amended and supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of February 15, 1991 (the "First Supplemental Indenture"), a Second Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of February 1, 1993 (the "Second Supplemental Indenture"), a Third Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of October 22, 2001 (the "Third Supplemental Indenture") and a Fourth Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of March 12, 2002 (the "Fourth Supplemental Indenture;" the Original Indenture, as amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, the Second Supplemental Indenture, the Third Supplemental Indenture, the Fourth Supplemental Indenture and any other indentures supplemental thereto, is hereinafter called the "Indenture"), each duly executed and delivered by the Issuer to JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank and Chemical Bank), as trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Issuer and the Holders of the Securities. The Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest (if any) at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions (if any), may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds (if any) and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Note is one of the series of Securities designated on the face hereof (the "Notes"). The Notes may be redeemed, in whole or from time to time in part, at the option of the Issuer on any date at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, and -2-
(2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the applicable Redemption Date) discounted to that Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 25 basis points, plus, in the case of both clause (1) and clause (2) above, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed to such Redemption Date; provided, however, that payments of interest on the Notes that are due and payable on or prior to a date fixed for redemption of Notes will be payable to the Holders of those Notes registered as such at the close of business on the relevant record dates according to their terms and the terms and provisions of the Indenture. Any such redemption shall be effected in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. As used in this Note, the following terms have the meanings set forth below: "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date for the Notes, (1) the yield, under the heading that represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the Final Maturity Date for the Notes, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month), or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the applicable Redemption Date. As used in the immediately preceding sentence and in the definition of "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" below, the term "Business Day" means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday that is not a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means, with respect to any Redemption Date for the Notes, the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues -3-
of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date for the Notes, (1) the average of four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations. "Final Maturity Date" means December 15, 2009. "Independent Investment Banker" means, with respect to any Redemption Date for the Notes, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and its successors or J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and its successors, whichever shall be selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Issuer, or, if both such firms or the respective successors, if any, to such firms, as the case may be, are unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Issuer. "Redemption Date" means, with respect to any Note or portion thereof to be redeemed, the date fixed for such redemption pursuant to the Indenture and the Notes. "Reference Treasury Dealers" means, with respect to any Redemption Date for the Notes, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and their respective successors (provided, however, that if any such firm or any such successor, as the case may be, shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Trustee, after consultation with the Issuer, shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer), and two other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Issuer. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date for the Notes, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by that Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding that Redemption Date. Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the applicable Redemption Date to each Holder of the Notes to be redeemed at the Holder's registered address. If less than all the Notes are to be redeemed at the option of the Issuer, the Trustee will select, in a manner it deems fair and appropriate, the Notes, or portions of the Notes, to be redeemed. Unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the redemption price (including interest accrued to the applicable Redemption Date), on and after the applicable Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions of the Notes called for redemption on that Redemption Date. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12.2 of the Indenture, any notice of redemption of the Notes need not set forth the redemption price but only the manner of -4-
calculation thereof. The Issuer will notify the Trustee of the redemption price promptly after the calculation thereof. The Trustee shall have no responsibility for such calculation. In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof and accrued and unpaid interest hereon may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture. The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Issuer and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected (voting as one class), evidenced as in the Indenture provided, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each such series; provided, that no such supplemental indenture shall, among other things, (i) extend the final maturity of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of any interest thereon, or reduce any amount payable on the redemption thereof, or make the principal thereof or the interest thereon payable in any coin or currency other than that provided in the Securities or in accordance with the terms thereof, or impair or affect the rights of any Holder to institute suit for the payment thereof, without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities the Holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected. It is also provided in the Indenture that, with respect to certain defaults or Events of Default, prior to any declaration accelerating the maturity of the Securities of any series, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series (or, in the case of certain defaults or Events of Default, all or certain series of the Securities) may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series (or all or certain series of the Securities, as the case may be) waive any such past default or Event of Default and its consequences. The preceding sentence shall not, however, apply to a default or Event of Default in respect of the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities or a default or Event of Default in respect of a covenant or provision of the Indenture which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and any Notes which may be issued in exchange or substitution herefor or on registration of transfer hereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Note or such other Notes. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Note in the manner, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed. The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000. Notes may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations upon surrender of the Notes to be exchanged at the agency of the Issuer maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of -5-
New York in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. The Notes are not subject to any sinking fund. Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note at the agency of the Issuer maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor, subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. The Issuer, the Trustee and any authorized agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon), for the purpose of receiving payment of, or on account of, the principal hereof and premium, if any, and, subject to the provisions of the first paragraph hereof, interest hereon and for all other purposes, and neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any authorized agent of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Issuer in the Indenture or in any Note, or because of any indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, of the Issuer or of any successor entity, either directly or through the Issuer or any successor entity, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof. This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, except as may otherwise be required by mandatory provisions of law. Terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Indenture. The Indenture contains provisions whereby the Issuer may be discharged from its obligations with respect to the Notes, subject to exceptions, if the Issuer deposits with the Trustee cash or U.S. Government Obligations in the amount and in the manner, and satisfies certain other conditions, as in the Indenture provided. This Note shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been signed by or on behalf of the Trustee under the Indenture by manual signature of an authorized officer of the Trustee.

(1) 100% of the principal amount of the Debentures to be redeemed, and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Debentures to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the applicable Redemption Date) discounted to that Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 30 basis points, plus, in the case of both clause (1) and clause (2) above, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Debentures being redeemed to such Redemption Date; provided, however, that payments of interest on the Debentures that are due and payable on or prior to a date fixed for redemption of Debentures will be payable to the Holders of those Debentures registered as such at the close of business on the relevant record dates according to their terms and the terms and provisions of the Indenture. Any such redemption shall be effected in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. As used in this Debenture, the following terms have the meanings set forth below: "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date for the Debentures, (1) the yield, under the heading that represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the Final Maturity Date for the Debentures, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month), or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the applicable Redemption Date. As used in the immediately preceding sentence and in the definition of "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" below, the term "Business Day" means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday that is not a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means, with respect to any Redemption Date for the Debentures, the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Debentures to be redeemed that -3-
would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Debentures to be redeemed. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date for the Debentures, (1) the average of four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations. "Final Maturity Date" means December 15, 2033. "Independent Investment Banker" means, with respect to any Redemption Date for the Debentures, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and its successors or J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and its successors, whichever shall be selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Issuer, or, if both such firms or the respective successors, if any, to such firms, as the case may be, are unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Issuer. "Redemption Date" means, with respect to any Debenture or portion thereof to be redeemed, the date fixed for such redemption pursuant to the Indenture and the Debentures. "Reference Treasury Dealers" means, with respect to any Redemption Date for the Debentures, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and their respective successors (provided, however, that if any such firm or any such successor, as the case may be, shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Trustee, after consultation with the Issuer, shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer), and two other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Issuer. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date for the Debentures, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by that Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding that Redemption Date. Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the applicable Redemption Date to each Holder of the Debentures to be redeemed at the Holder's registered address. If less than all the Debentures are to be redeemed at the option of the Issuer, the Trustee will select, in a manner it deems fair and appropriate, the Debentures, or portions of the Debentures, to be redeemed. Unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the redemption price (including interest accrued to the applicable Redemption Date), on and after the applicable Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Debentures or portions of the Debentures called for redemption on that Redemption Date. -4-
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12.2 of the Indenture, any notice of redemption of the Debentures need not set forth the redemption price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Issuer will notify the Trustee of the redemption price promptly after the calculation thereof. The Trustee shall have no responsibility for such calculation. In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Debentures shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof and accrued and unpaid interest hereon may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture. The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Issuer and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected (voting as one class), evidenced as in the Indenture provided, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each such series; provided, that no such supplemental indenture shall, among other things, (i) extend the final maturity of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of any interest thereon, or reduce any amount payable on the redemption thereof, or make the principal thereof or the interest thereon payable in any coin or currency other than that provided in the Securities or in accordance with the terms thereof, or impair or affect the rights of any Holder to institute suit for the payment thereof, without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities the Holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected. It is also provided in the Indenture that, with respect to certain defaults or Events of Default, prior to any declaration accelerating the maturity of the Securities of any series, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series (or, in the case of certain defaults or Events of Default, all or certain series of the Securities) may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series (or all or certain series of the Securities, as the case may be) waive any such past default or Event of Default and its consequences. The preceding sentence shall not, however, apply to a default or Event of Default in respect of the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities or a default or Event of Default in respect of a covenant or provision of the Indenture which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Debenture (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Debenture and any Debentures which may be issued in exchange or substitution herefor or on registration of transfer hereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Debenture or such other Debentures. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Debenture or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Debenture in the manner, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed. The Debentures are issuable in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000. Debentures may be exchanged for a like aggregate -5-
principal amount of Debentures of other authorized denominations upon surrender of the Debentures to be exchanged at the agency of the Issuer maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. The Debentures are not subject to any sinking fund. Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Debenture at the agency of the Issuer maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, a new Debenture or Debentures of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor, subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. The Issuer, the Trustee and any authorized agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Debenture (whether or not this Debenture shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon), for the purpose of receiving payment of, or on account of, the principal hereof and premium, if any, and, subject to the provisions of the first paragraph hereof, interest hereon and for all other purposes, and neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any authorized agent of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Issuer in the Indenture or in any Debenture, or because of any indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, of the Issuer or of any successor entity, either directly or through the Issuer or any successor entity, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof. This Debenture shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, except as may otherwise be required by mandatory provisions of law. Terms used in this Debenture which are defined in the Indenture shall have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Indenture. The Indenture contains provisions whereby the Issuer may be discharged from its obligations with respect to the Debentures, subject to exceptions, if the Issuer deposits with the Trustee cash or U.S. Government Obligations in the amount and in the manner, and satisfies certain other conditions, as in the Indenture provided. This Debenture shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been signed by or on behalf of the Trustee under the Indenture by manual signature of an authorized officer of the Trustee.
