SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON D.C., 20549 ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION On January 21, 2005, Weyerhaeuser Company issued a press release stating the following: Weyerhaeuser Reports Net Earnings of $1.3 Billion for 2004, Or $5.43 per Diluted Share, on Net Sales of $22.7 Billion FEDERAL WAY, Wash. - Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE: WY) today reported net earnings of $1.3 billion for 2004, or $5.43 per diluted share, on net sales of $22.7 billion. This compares with $277 million, or $1.25 per diluted share, on net sales of $19.9 billion for the full year 2003. Fourth quarter 2004 earnings were $199 million, or 82 cents per diluted share, on net sales of $5.9 billion. Last year, Weyerhaeuser reported fourth quarter net earnings of $92 million, or 41 cents per diluted share, on net sales of $5.1 billion. Fourth quarter 2004 earnings include the following after-tax items: * A charge of $34 million, or 14 cents per diluted share, for early extinguishment of debt. * A gain of $24 million, or 10 cents per diluted share, for gains on the sale of facilities. * A charge of $19 million, or 8 cents per diluted share, for the impairment of assets in the company's European manufacturing operations. * A charge of $16 million, or 7 cents per diluted share, recognized in connection with a change in the method of estimating workers' compensation liabilities. * A charge of $15 million, or 6 cents per diluted share, for the net book value of technology donated to a university. Fourth quarter 2003 earnings included the following after-tax items: * A charge of $29 million, or 14 cents per diluted share, for closure of facilities. * A charge of $17 million, or 8 cents per diluted share, for integration and restructuring activities. * A charge of $5 million, or 2 cents per diluted share, associated with the settlement of litigation. * A gain of $40 million, or 18 cents per diluted share, on the sale of timberlands in Tennessee and the Carolinas.
Other significant fourth quarter 2004 financial matters include: * The company, including Real Estate and Related Assets, reduced outstanding debt by approximately $730 million. For the year, the company reduced outstanding debt by approximately $1.9 billion and ended the year with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments and approximately $10.6 billion in outstanding debt. * Capital spending, excluding Real Estate and Related Assets, for 2004 was approximately $504 million. "Our strong performance for the year demonstrates that our focus on customers, efficiency and financial management has created a competitive Weyerhaeuser that can deliver strong shareholder returns," said Steven R. Rogel, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "In the fourth quarter, however, some of our businesses experienced higher than expected costs which hurt our results. Some of these costs resulted from maintenance we had delayed until the fourth quarter due to strong market demand earlier in the year. We also incurred additional costs due to weather-related issues and the downtime we took to balance orders with customer demand. As we look to the first quarter, we are concerned about the impact unusually bad weather may have on our results." SUMMARY OF FOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Millions (except per share data) 4Q 2004 4Q 2003 Change Net earnings $199 $92 $107 Earnings per diluted share $0.82 $0.41 $0.41 Net sales $5,886 $5,145 $741 SUMMARY OF ANNUAL FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Millions (except per share data) 2004 2003 Change Net earnings $1,283 $277 $1,006 Earnings per diluted share $5.43 $1.25 $4.18 Net sale $22,665 $19,873 $2,792 SEGMENT RESULTS FOR FOURTH QUARTER (Contributions to Pre-Tax Earnings) Millions 4Q 2004 4Q 2003 Change Timberlands $217 $185 $32 Wood Products $72 $111 ($39) Pulp and Paper $35 ($67) $102 Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling $81 $32 $49 Real Estate and Related Assets $217 $109 $108 TIMBERLANDS 4Q 2004 3Q 2004 Change Contribution to pre-tax earnings (millions) $217 $450 ($233) Excluding the third quarter $271 million pre-tax gain on the sale of 270,000 acres of timberlands in Georgia, fourth quarter earnings increased $38 million from the third quarter primarily because of sales of other non-strategic timberlands that closed earlier than expected. Weyerhaeuser expects first quarter market conditions to be similar to fourth quarter.
WOOD PRODUCTS 4Q 2004 3Q 2004 Change Contribution to pre-tax earnings (millions) $72 $362 ($290) Fourth quarter earnings of $72 million include a $30 million pre-tax gain from the sale of a mill site in Vancouver, British Columbia, and a $6 million pre-tax gain from the sale of three mills in the Carolinas. Third quarter earnings included a $20 million pre-tax gain from the tenure reallocation agreement with the British Columbia government and a $20 million reduction in the reserve for hardboard siding claims. As expected, fourth quarter prices were significantly lower than third quarter, particularly in softwood lumber and structural panels. In addition, higher delivered log costs in the South and Canada caused by weather-related transportation disruptions and shortages affected the segment. Higher resin and energy costs, and a stronger Canadian dollar also negatively affected the segment. Volumes of key products declined approximately six percent due to seasonal market conditions. The company also experienced extended maintenance at several facilities, including its largest oriented strand board facility. The segment incurred $27 million in countervailing and anti-dumping duties and related costs on Canadian softwood lumber the company sold into the United States in the fourth quarter, compared with $31 million in the third quarter. For the year, the company incurred $118 million in countervailing and anti-dumping duties and related costs, compared with $97 million in 2003. Weyerhaeuser expects first quarter earnings to increase from fourth quarter due to improving prices and strong housing starts. PULP AND PAPER 4Q 2004 3Q 2004 Change Contribution to pre-tax earnings (millions) $35 $80 ($45) Earnings declined during the quarter due to higher costs associated with planned maintenance downtime, a stronger Canadian dollar, and higher than anticipated energy costs. Papergrade pulp prices, which had declined early in the quarter, began to recover. Fluff pulp prices improved slightly. Pricing for Fine Paper products improved compared with third quarter. Weyerhaeuser expects higher first quarter earnings compared with fourth quarter. Prices for papergrade pulp, which began improving late in the quarter, should continue to improve. Fine Paper prices are expected to hold steady.
CONTAINERBOARD, PACKAGING AND RECYCLING 4Q 2004 3Q 2004 Change Contribution to pre-tax earnings (millions $81 $82 ($1) Fourth quarter earnings were relatively unchanged from third quarter. Higher fourth quarter containerboard and box prices offset lower box shipments and higher energy and maintenance costs. During the fourth quarter, Weyerhaeuser took 24,000 tons of market downtime. The company expects first quarter earnings to be consistent with the fourth quarter. REAL ESTATE AND RELATED ASSETS 4Q 2004 3Q 2004 Change Contribution to pre-tax earnings (millions) $217 $155 $62 Fourth quarter earnings benefited from increased single-family home closings, and higher sales prices and margins. In addition, a $24 million net pre-tax gain on land and lot sales contributed to earnings. Sales of single-family homes declined seasonally during the quarter compared to the prior quarter. The backlog of homes sold, but not closed, at the end of the fourth quarter is near six months. Weyerhaeuser expects first quarter earnings to decline seasonally from fourth quarter due to decreased single-family home closings in the markets in which the company operates.

### This news release contains statements concerning the company's future results and performance that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Some of these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "expects," "may," "will," "believes," "should," "approximately," "anticipates," "estimates," and "plans," and the negative or other variations of those terms or comparable terminology or by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. In particular, some of these forward-looking statements deal with expectations regarding the company's markets in the first quarter of 2005; expected earnings and performance of the company's business segments during the first quarter of 2005, demand and pricing for the company's products in the first quarter of 2005, non-strategic timberland sales in the first quarter of 2005, seasonal decline in single-family home closings in the first quarter of 2005, effect of Canadian exchange rate, and other matters. The accuracy of such statements is subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, including, but not limited to, the effect of general economic conditions, including the level of interest rates and housing starts; market demand for the company's products, which may be tied to the relative strength of various U.S. business segments; energy prices; weather conditions; availability and pricing of raw materials, performance of the company's manufacturing operations; the successful execution of internal performance plans; the level of competition from domestic and foreign producers; the effect of forestry, land use, environmental and other governmental regulations; fires, floods and other natural disasters; disruption of transportation and legal proceedings. The company is also a large exporter and is affected by changes in economic activity in Europe and Asia, particularly Japan, and by changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the relative value of the U.S. dollar to the Euro and the Canadian dollar; and restrictions on international trade or tariffs imposed on imports, including the countervailing and dumping duties imposed on the company's softwood lumber shipments from Canada to the United States. These and other factors that could cause or contribute to actual results differing materially from such forward looking statements are discussed in greater detail in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
