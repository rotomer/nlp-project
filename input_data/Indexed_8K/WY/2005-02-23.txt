In the event of any such loss during the Interim Period in excess of $500,000 as determined by the Destruction Value Table set out in Schedule 3.7(b), the parties agree to adjust the Purchase Price, for the amount in excess of $500,000, at Closing based upon the Destruction Value Table. In no event shall the cumulative adjustments for the matters described in this Section 3.7 exceed 20% of the Purchase Price. 3.8 ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE The Seller and the Buyer agree to allocate the Purchase Price among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Schedule 3.8 and, for greater certainty, the Purchase Price allocated to an Ownership Interest in an Acquired Entity shall include the Net Working Capital of that Acquired Entity. The Seller and the Buyer agree that the values so attributed to the Purchased Assets are the respective fair market values thereof, and each party shall report the sale and purchase of the Purchased Assets for all federal, provincial, state and local tax purposes in mutually agreeable form and in a manner consistent with such allocation. Each party will promptly notify the other -36-
if it receives notice that a taxing authority proposes any allocation that is different from the allocation in Schedule 3.8. 3.9 ADJUSTMENTS To the extent not included in Net Working Capital or otherwise dealt with in this Agreement, all adjustments relating to the Fee Simple Real Property and Timber Tenures, both incoming and outgoing, including without limitation annual rents, property taxes, local improvement charges, utilities, deposits and interest thereon, if any, and all other similar matters customarily pro-rated in the sale of real property shall be pro-rated between the parties as of the Closing Date, so that the Seller shall bear and pay all such expenses in respect of the period before the Closing Date and the Buyer shall bear all expenses in respect of the period on and after the Closing Date. 3.10 DEPOSIT (a) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Buyer shall deposit in escrow with the Escrow Agent the Deposit, which amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent in escrow in an interest bearing account.

(b) If the Buyer fails to consummate the purchase of the Purchased Business when it is otherwise obligated to do so hereunder, then the Deposit shall be paid over to the Seller, the same being agreed upon as liquidated damages for such failure. The Seller agrees to accept and take the Deposit as its total damages and relief and as the Seller's sole and exclusive remedy hereunder. The parties agree and acknowledge that: (i) the Seller would suffer damages by reason of a failure of this transaction to close; (ii) the exact amount of such damages would be difficult to ascertain and to prove with certainty; (iii) the Deposit constitutes a fair and reasonable estimate of the actual damages the Seller would suffer; and (iv) the parties have negotiated and attempted, in good faith, to estimate the amount of such damages and to compensate the Seller therefore as set forth herein. 3.11 REDEEMABLE SHARES Notwithstanding Section 3.2(a), the Seller agrees to accept as payment for the amount of the Purchase Price allocated to the purchase of Purchased Assets in respect of which PST is exigible the issuance by the Buyer to the Seller of redeemable preferred shares ("PREFERRED SHARES") having a redemption price equal to the amount of the Purchase Price so allocated; and the Buyer agrees to advance to the Seller at the Closing as an interest-free loan an amount equal to such -37-
allocated amount of the Purchase Price and recourse of the Buyer against the Seller under such loan shall be limited to the Preferred Shares. The Seller agrees not to redeem the Preferred Shares until at least eight months and one day after the Closing Date. Upon redemption of such Preferred Shares by the Seller, the redemption price thereof may be set off by the Buyer against the amount of such loan outstanding. The Seller has the right to redeem the Preferred Shares at any time that is at least eight months and one day after Closing by way of set-off against the full amount of the interest free loan from the Buyer to the Seller. The Buyer agrees to indemnify the Seller for all costs and Liabilities to the Seller with respect to this arrangement. 3.12 PRE-CLOSING TRANSACTIONS (a) During the Interim Period, the Seller, at its sole discretion, may undertake any of the transactions described in Schedule 3.12. (b) If the amount of a debt owing by an Acquired Entity to the Seller arising from a transaction described in Schedule 3.12 exceeds the net working capital of the Acquired Entity without taking into account such debt (an "Excess") then (i) $1,221,500,000 shall be reduced by the aggregate of each such Excess and (ii) the related portion of the Purchase Price allocated on Schedule 3.8 to the Ownership Interest in each such Acquired Entity shall be reduced by such Excess. 3.13 REAL ESTATE SALES ADJUSTMENT If the Seller enters into one or more executed purchase and sale agreements with Third Parties in respect of Real Property that have closed prior to the Closing Date or that are still in effect as of the Closing Date, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by: (a) if the sale(s) is in respect of Real Property other than a Permitted Sale, 90% of the proceeds from the disposition for all such sales; or (b) if the sale(s) is in respect of Real Property which is a Permitted Sale, by 90% of the amount that the proceeds of the disposition for all such sales exceeds $18 million multiplied by the number of days from January 1, 2005 to the Closing Date divided by 365. 3.14 ACQUIRED ENTITIES ADJUSTMENT In the event that, as a result of the exercise of any right to purchase held by a Third Party, the Seller is unable to deliver any Ownership Interest, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the purchase price paid or payable to the Seller, upon the exercise of that right by the Third Party. 3.15 RFR LANDS The Seller shall take all steps required by the applicable right of first refusal to permit the Seller to transfer to the Buyer fee simple title to the properties subject to the right(s) of first refusal in favour of a Third Party registered under No. EM52257 and No. ED2363. If the applicable Third Party does not exercise the right of first refusal then the property subject to the right of first refusal shall form part of the Fee Simple Real Property and shall be transferred to the Buyer on -38-
Closing. If the Third Party exercises the right of first refusal then the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the purchase price paid or payable to the Seller. The Buyer shall take all reasonable steps to cooperate and assist the Seller with respect to the Seller's obligations under this Section. 4.

term (or any right or benefit arising thereunder, including the enforcement for the benefit of Buyer of any and all rights of Seller against a party to that Contract or License and Permit).

The lease shall be a triple net lease under which the Buyer shall be responsible for all maintenance, repair, replacements, insurance and any and all other matters or costs relating to the Poplar Lands, including an allocation of environmental liabilities on the same basis as is applicable to the Fee Simple Real Property pursuant to this Agreement which, for greater certainty, means that the Buyer assumes, and will indemnify the Seller for, all Environmental Liabilities with respect to the Poplar Lands except for those Environmental Liabilities that are subject to an indemnity to be provided by the Seller on the same terms and conditions and subject to the same time, thresholds and limits of liability set out in Article 10 and Article 14.

Purchase Price, that gives the Seller a 5% annual return on the fair market value of the Poplar Lands excluding the timber. The Seller shall assign and the Buyer shall assume the rights and obligations of the Seller under the Poplar Licences; and (c) an option to purchase the Poplar Lands exercisable in respect of the parcels under each Poplar Licence by written notice to the Seller within 60 days of the expiry or termination of the Poplar Licence applicable to such parcels.

Any purchase of parcels under the option to purchase shall close 30 days after the Buyer exercises the option in respect of such parcels, with the Buyer being responsible for any taxes or registration fees in respect of the purchase, including property transfer tax. The option shall also contain a put whereby the Seller may, within 60 days of the expiry or termination of a Poplar Licence, give written notice to the Buyer requiring the Buyer to acquire the parcels which are the subject of the Poplar Licence for one dollar and the Buyer shall close the purchase of those parcels 30 days after the Seller exercises the put in respect of those parcels. On any acquisition of all or any part of the Poplar Lands, the Buyer assumes, and will indemnify the Seller for all Environmental Liabilities with respect to the acquired lands on the same terms and conditions as set out in this Agreement with respect to Fee Simple Real Property. The Seller represents, warrants and covenants to the Buyer that the grant of the timber reservation, lease and option to purchase shall not constitute a breach of the Poplar Licences and will not invoke the right of first refusal to purchase the Poplar Lands contained in the Poplar Licences. The Seller shall indemnify and save harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against all Liabilities suffered or incurred by the Buyer as a result of or arising directly or indirectly out of or in connection with the breach or inaccuracy of this representation, warranty and covenant. On the Closing Date, the Seller shall grant to the Buyer a registrable lease and option to purchase incorporating the terms of this Section which shall be registered in priority to any financial charges affecting the Poplar Lands. Notwithstanding the provisions of clauses (b) and (c) where portions of a parcel are comprised in more than one Poplar Licence, the expiry date of the lease and commencement of the period for exercise of the option to purchase and put shall be based on the latest expiry or termination of the Poplar Licences applicable to such parcel. The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Poplar Interests shall be subject to the Permitted Encumbrances, which include, without limitation, the Poplar Licences. The Seller shall, following execution and delivery of this Agreement, request Pacifica Poplars Ltd. to waive -65-
the rights of first refusal to purchase the Poplar Lands contained in the Poplar Licences with respect to this transaction (provided the Buyer agrees to honour such Licences). If Pacifica Poplars Ltd. agrees to so waive its rights of first refusal to purchase, the Seller agrees to convey fee simple title to the Poplar Lands to the Buyer at the Time of Closing in lieu of granting the Poplar Interests and in such event the Poplar Licences, including the rights of first refusal to purchase therein, shall continue to be Permitted Encumbrances. 9.20 SPROAT LOT 98 INTERESTS The Seller shall grant the following interests (collectively, the "SPROAT LOT 98 INTERESTS") to the Buyer on the Closing Date: (a) a timber reservation entitling the Buyer to all timber on Lot 98, and the right to harvest such timber, in consideration of the fair market value of such timber which shall form part of the Purchase Price; (b) a lease of Lot 98 for a term ending on October 31, 2006, provided that if the Timberwest Licence expires or terminates earlier than July 18, 2006, the lease shall terminate on the 90th day after the expiry or termination of the Timberwest Licence. The lease shall be a triple net lease under which the Buyer shall be responsible for all maintenance, repair, replacements, insurance and any and all other matters or costs relating to Lot 98, including an allocation of environmental liabilities on the same basis as is applicable to the Fee Simple Real Property pursuant to this Agreement which, for greater certainty, means that the Buyer assumes, and will indemnify the Seller for, all Environmental Liabilities with respect to Lot 98 except for those Environmental Liabilities that are subject to an indemnity to be provided by the Seller on the same terms and conditions and subject to the same time, thresholds and limits of liability set out in Article 10 and Article 14. The Buyer shall pay basic rent in a lump sum on the Closing Date that gives the Seller a 5% annual return on the fair market value of Lot 98 excluding the timber. The Seller shall assign and the Buyer shall assume the rights and obligations of the Seller under the Timberwest Licence; (c) an option to purchase Lot 98 exercisable by written notice to the Seller within 60 days of the expiry or termination of the Timberwest Licence.

The purchase under the option to purchase shall close 30 days after the Buyer exercises the option, with the Buyer being responsible for any taxes or registration fees in respect of the purchase, including property transfer tax.

whereby the Seller may, within 60 days of the expiry or termination of the Timberwest Licence, give written notice to the Buyer requiring the Buyer to acquire Lot 98 for one dollar and the Buyer shall close the purchase of Lot 98 30 days after the Seller exercises the put. On the acquisition of Lot 98, the Buyer assumes, and will indemnify the Seller for all Environmental Liabilities with respect to the acquired lands on the same terms and conditions as set out in this Agreement with respect to Fee Simple Real Property; and (d) an assignment of the sale proceeds if and when payable under the Option to Purchase (Right of First Refusal) G-4707 dated July 19, 2001 between the Seller and Timberwest Forest Company, a partnership (as successor to TFL Forest Ltd.). The Buyer shall, at its own cost, perform the Seller's obligations to subdivide Lot 98 as provided in Option to Purchase (Right of First Refusal) G-4707 and shall otherwise administer that agreement at its own cost on behalf of the Seller. The Seller shall, at the request of the Buyer, cooperate with the Buyer to execute and deliver such documents and plans at the Buyer may request to effect such subdivision and sale. The Seller represents, warrants and covenants to the Buyer that the grant of the Sproat Lot 98 Interests shall not constitute a breach of the Option to Purchase (Right of First Refusal) G-4707 and will not invoke the right of first refusal to purchase Lot 98 contained therein. The Seller shall indemnify and save harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against all losses suffered or incurred by the Buyer as a result of or arising directly or indirectly out of or in connection with the breach or inaccuracy of this representation, warranty and covenant.

The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Sproat Lot 98 Interests shall be subject to the Permitted Encumbrances, which include, without limitation, the Timberwest Licence and Option to Purchase (Right of First Refusal) G-4707. The Seller shall, following execution and delivery of this Agreement, request Timberwest Forest Company to waive such Right of First Refusal with respect to this transaction (provided the Buyer agrees to honour the Timberwest Licence and Option to Purchase (Right of First Refusal) G-4707). If Timberwest Forest Company agrees to so waive its Right of First Refusal, the Seller agrees to convey fee simple title to Lot 98 to the Buyer on the Closing Date in lieu of granting the Sproat Lot 98 Interests and in such event the Timberwest Licence and Option to Purchase (Right of First Refusal) G-4707 shall continue to be Permitted Encumbrances. 9.21 LITIGATION MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT On the Closing Date, the parties shall enter into a litigation management agreement substantially in the form set out as Schedule 9.21 (the "LITIGATION MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT"). 9.22 NEW ENCUMBRANCES During the Interim Period, the Seller shall provide written notice to the Buyer of all new Encumbrances registered against Real Property. -67-

The Buyer shall permit the Seller and its employees, contractors and agents reasonable access to the Purchased Assets upon prior notice to inspect, test, obtain samples of substances or environmental media and to carry out Remediation. (b) In controlling Remediation under subsection (a), the Seller will retain only qualified environmental consultants and contractors to perform Remediation studies and work, will comply with all Applicable Laws, and will conduct the Remediation in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the Buyer's operations and business.

Buyer's property to substantially the condition it was before the commencement of the Remediation. The Buyer may at its sole expense (and with or without its own consultants) monitor the Remediation, including any field work undertaken by the Seller or its consultants and is entitled to copies of all reports, studies, investigations, analysis, correspondence and field notes prepared in connection with the Remediation. The Seller will provide the Buyer with progress reports on the Remediation so that the Buyer is kept informed on the status of the Remediation. If the Seller does not commence and diligently perform the Remediation in accordance with Section 10.2(b), the Buyer may, after providing written notice of such default and allowing the Seller a reasonable time in the circumstances to correct such default, undertake the Remediation at Seller's cost, in which event the Seller will pay the amount of the Buyer's reasonable costs of Remediation. 10.8 DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL WORK If there is a dispute over whether a particular Environmental Condition existed before the Closing Date or the scope or adequacy of any Remediation required under the Environmental Covenants, the parties agree to attempt to resolve the matters in dispute within sixty days from the date either party gives notice of the dispute to the other. If the parties cannot resolve the dispute within that sixty (60) day period, each party shall identify an Environmental Expert to provide a non-binding, advisory opinion. If the parties are unable to agree on a mutually acceptable Environmental Expert, either party may apply to the Association of Professional Engineers to have an Environmental Expert appointed, which may involve appointment of an Environmental Expert from among the two individuals initially proposed by the parties or from a more extensive list of candidates provided by the parties. The Environmental Expert shall be given access to existing materials and information reasonably requested by him or her and shall be provided with all other materials or submissions as either party considers to be material, acting reasonably. The Environmental Expert will act as an expert and not as an arbitrator and shall render a non-binding, advisory opinion in a written report to the parties setting forth her or his opinion as to the resolution of the matters in dispute. The parties waive any objection to the offering into evidence of the Environmental Expert's report and opinion or related testimony in the event of any administrative or judicial proceeding or arbitration between them. The fees and expenses of the Environmental Expert shall be borne by the parties in equal shares. If after receipt of the Environmental Expert's report, the parties are unable to resolve the matter in dispute, either party may have recourse to the courts of British Columbia. 10.9 WAIVER OF SITE PROFILE The Buyer waives the requirement, if any, under the Environmental Management Act (British Columbia) or any replacement legislation, for the Seller to provide a site profile for any of the Real Property. -75-

The Buyer agrees that its sole recourse against the Seller in the event of any breach by the Seller of, or any inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty of the Seller contained in this Agreement shall be recourse to a claim for indemnification under this Article 14 and Article 10, if applicable. 14.2 INDEMNIFICATION BY THE BUYER (a) Subject to the other provisions of this Article 14, the Buyer agrees to indemnify and save harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against all Losses suffered or incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties as a result of or arising directly or indirectly out of or in connection with: (i) REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES - any breach by the Buyer of, or any inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement; (ii) COVENANTS - any breach or non-performance by the Buyer of any covenant to be performed by the Buyer that is contained in this Agreement; (iii) SECTION 54.6 LIABILITIES - any joint and several liability imposed on the Seller by subsection 54.6(2) of the Forest Act (British Columbia) for any -85-
Liabilities that are Assumed Liabilities to the extent the Seller is not otherwise indemnified by the Buyer for any such liability; and (iv) POST-CLOSING - the operations of the Purchased Business and ownership of the Purchased Assets after the Time of Closing including, without limitation, any failure by the Buyer to pay, satisfy, discharge, perform or fulfil any of the Assumed Liabilities or any of the other obligations and Liabilities of the Seller to be assumed by the Buyer in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

Such notice shall specify whether the Claim arises as a result of a Third Party Claim or whether it is a Direct Claim, and shall also specify with reasonable particularity (to the extent that the information is available): (a) the factual basis for the Claim; and (b) the amount of the Claim, if known. If, through the fault of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party does not receive notice of any Claim in time to effectively contest the determination of any liability susceptible of being contested, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to set off against the amount claimed by the -86-
Indemnified Party the amount of any Losses incurred by the Indemnifying Party resulting from the Indemnified Party's failure to give such notice on a timely basis. 14.4 DIRECT CLAIMS With respect to any Direct Claim, following receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of the Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty days to make such investigation of the Claim as is considered necessary or desirable. For the purpose of such investigation, the Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party the information relied upon by the Indemnified Party to substantiate the Claim, together with all such other information as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. If both parties agree at or before the expiration of such thirty day period (or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof) to the validity and amount of such Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall immediately pay to the Indemnified Party the full agreed upon amount of the Claim. 14.5 THIRD PARTY CLAIMS With respect to any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its expense, to participate in or assume control of the negotiation, settlement or defence of the Claim and, in such event, the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for all of the Indemnified Party's out-of-pocket expenses as a result of such participation or assumption. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume such control, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to monitor, but not participate in the negotiation, settlement or defence of, such Third Party Claim and to retain counsel to act on its behalf, provided that the fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party unless the Indemnifying Party consents to the retention of such counsel or unless the named parties to any action or proceeding include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and a representation of both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to the actual or potential differing interests between them (such as the availability of different defences). If the Indemnifying Party, having elected to assume such control, thereafter fails to defend the Third Party Claim within a reasonable time, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume such control and the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by the results obtained by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. If any Third Party Claim is of a nature such that the Indemnified Party is required by Applicable Law to make a payment to any Third Party with respect to the Third Party Claim before the completion of settlement negotiations or related Legal Proceedings, the Indemnified Party may make such payment and the Indemnifying Party shall, forthwith after demand by the Indemnified Party, reimburse the Indemnified Party for such payment. If the amount of any liability of the Indemnified Party under the Third Party Claim with respect to which such a payment was made, as finally determined, is less than the amount that was paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall, forthwith after receipt of the difference from the Third Party, pay the amount of such difference to the Indemnifying Party. 14.6 SETTLEMENT OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume control of the defence of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the exclusive right to contest, settle or pay the amount claimed. -87-
Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes control of the negotiation, settlement or defence of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Third Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that the liability of the Indemnifying Party shall be limited to the proposed settlement amount if any such consent is not obtained for any reason. 14.7 CO-OPERATION The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall co-operate fully with each other with respect to Third Party Claims, and shall keep each other fully advised with respect thereto (including supplying copies of all relevant documentation promptly as it becomes available). 14.8 THRESHOLDS Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (other than section 14.13), neither party shall assert against the other party any Claim (including, without limitation under Article 10) unless the aggregate amount of the Claim or Claims asserted is at least 1.0% of the Purchase Price, without counting any Claim under 0.05% of the Purchase Price. Once the amount of such Claims reaches at least 1.0% of the Purchase Price in the aggregate, the obligation to indemnify shall apply (in which case the Indemnifying Party will be obliged to indemnify for only that portion of such Claims over 1.0% of the Purchase Price in aggregate) with respect to all Claims having a value of at least 0.05% of the Purchase Price. The thresholds set forth in this Section 14.8 shall not apply to indemnification for breaches of warranties under Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.7, 6.9, 6.21, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 or to any breach by the Indemnifying Party of any covenant or obligation in this Agreement and the Indemnifying Party, subject to Section 14.10, shall be liable for all damages with respect to any such breaches. For the purposes of determining whether the thresholds in this Section 14.8 have been met: (i) the amount of the Claim is the amount of the Loss or Liability suffered or incurred by the party making the Claim, and (ii) the Purchase Price shall not include the Assumed Liabilities. 14.9 REDUCTION The liability of the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article 14 shall be reduced to the extent: (a) COLLECTIBLE INSURANCE - that the Indemnified Party is entitled to be indemnified for any Loss by valid and collectible insurance; and (b) TAXATION - of any related reasonably determinable Tax benefits available to the Indemnified Party as a result of the matters giving rise to the Indemnified Party's Claim so that the Indemnified Party is in the same position the Indemnified Party would have been, and not in a better position or a worse position than the Indemnified Party would have been, on an after Tax basis in the absence of the events or circumstances that gave rise to the Claim; and the Indemnified Party shall have a duty to take all reasonable steps to mitigate its Losses. -88-
