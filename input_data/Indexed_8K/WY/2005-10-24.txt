SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON D.C., 20549 ITEM 2.05. COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES On October 18, 2005, Weyerhaeuser Company approved the closure of its plywood mill in Wright City, Oklahoma. The closure will be effective October 24, 2005. The plywood operation in Wright City has been closed since August 29, 2005 following a structural collapse of the building housing the plywood presses. In the interim the mill began making veneer and landscape timbers only. Approximately 100 plywood employees have been on layoff. Following engineering studies, and as part of a strategic review of the Company's plywood business, the decision was made to utilize other existing facilities in the system to replace Wright City's veneer and plywood production, in lieu of making a capital investment in the Wright City plant. The company is unable in good faith at this time to make a determination of the estimated charges and expenditures to be incurred in connection with the closure of the Wright City plywood mill and will file an amended report on Form 8-K as soon as such charges and expenditures are determined. SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
