ITEM 2.06. MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS
     On November 22, 2005, Weyerhaeuser Company approved the indefinite curtailment of production on a 350,000 ton containerboard machine in Plymouth, North Carolina. The company will recommend to its board of directors that the machine be shut down permanently.
     In reaching its decision, the company determined that the 48-year-old Plymouth machine no longer is economically sustainable due to its age and high cost, compounded by severe market conditions. The indefinite production curtailment affects approximately 200 hourly and salaried positions in Plymouth.
     In approving the indefinite curtailment of production of the Plymouth machine, the company determined that it is likely that the company will incur a material impairment charge in connection with the curtailment. The company is in the process of conducting an impairment analysis and is unable in good faith at this time to make a determination of the estimated amount or range of amounts of the impairment charge or the amount or range of amounts of the impairment charge that will result in future cash expenditures. The company will file an amended report on Form 8-K as soon as such amounts and expenditures are determined.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
