SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON D.C., 20549 ITEM 7.01. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE On December 1, 2005, Weyerhaeuser Company issued a press release stating the Following: Weyerhaeuser Company Announces Expiration of its Any and All Tender Offers FEDERAL WAY, Wash. - Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:WY) announced the expiration of its Any and All Offers. According to the information provided by Global Bondholder Services Corporation, the depositary for the tender offers, $64,760,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 8.375 percent Debentures due Feb. 15, 2007 and $212,990,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 5.250 percent Notes due Dec. 15, 2009 were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or before the expiration of the Any and All Offers at 5:00 p.m. New York City time, on Dec. 1, 2005. Weyerhaeuser has accepted for payment all securities validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Any and All Offers and expects that the applicable payment for the securities purchased pursuant to the Any and All Offers will be made by the depositary in same-day funds on Dec. 2, 2005. In addition, according to information provided by Global Bondholder Services Corporation, as of 5:00 p.m. New York City time, on Dec. 1, 2005, $359,835,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 6.125 percent Notes due March 15, 2007 were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Dec. 1, 2005, the early tender date for the Maximum Tender Offers. Under the conditions specified in its Offer to Purchase dated November 16, 2005, the Maximum Principal Amount to be Accepted will, in the case of the 6.125 percent Notes due March 15, 2007, be equal to the lesser of (i) $300,000,000 and (ii) the difference between $500,000,000 (the "Tender Cap") and the principal amount of securities purchased by Weyerhaeuser pursuant to the Any and All Offers. The Maximum Principal Amount to be Accepted by Weyerhaeuser pursuant to the Maximum Tender Offers is $222,250,000. Because the principal amount of 6.125 percent Notes due March 15, 2007 validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or before the early tender date exceeded the Maximum Principal Amount to be Accepted for the 6.125 percent Notes due March 15, 2007, Weyerhaeuser will not purchase any of its 5.950 percent Notes due November 1, 2008 in the Maximum Tender Offers. Securities of this class that have been tendered will be returned promptly to the tendering holders.
The Table below sets forth more fully the amount of securities validly tendered and accepted in the offers to date.
