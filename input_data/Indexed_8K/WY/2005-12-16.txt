SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON D.C., 20549 ITEM 2.06. MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS (a) On November 22, 2005, Weyerhaeuser Company approved the indefinite curtailment of production on a 350,000 ton containerboard machine in Plymouth, North Carolina. The company will recommend to its board of directors that the machine be shut down permanently. In reaching its decision, the company determined that the 48-year-old Plymouth machine no longer is economically sustainable due to its age and high cost, compounded by severe market conditions. The indefinite production curtailment affects approximately 200 hourly and salaried positions in Plymouth. In approving the indefinite curtailment of production of the Plymouth machine, the company determined that it is likely that the company will incur a material impairment charge in connection with the curtailment. The company was unable to estimate the amount of the charge, however, until it completed an impairment analysis On December 14, 2005 the company determined the estimated amount of the charge for impairment of the assets relating to indefinite closure of the Plymouth machine. (b) The company estimates the impairment charge required for the indefinite closure of the Plymouth containerboard machine to be in the range of approximately $93 million to $110 million, including termination benefits. (c) The company also estimates that it will incur future cash expenditures of approximately $4 million to $6 million of the impairment charge, relating to payment of termination benefits.
