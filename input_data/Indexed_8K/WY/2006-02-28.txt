SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON D.C., 20549 ITEM 7.01. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE On February 24, 2006, Weyerhaeuser Company issued a press release stating the following: Weyerhaeuser Names Kenneth F. Khoury SVP, General Counsel FEDERAL WAY, Wash. (Feb. 24, 2006) - Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE: WY) today announced that the board of directors has elected Kenneth F. Khoury, 54, senior vice president and general counsel effective April 3. Khoury will report to Steven R. Rogel, chairman, president and chief executive officer, and will become a member of the company's senior management team. He succeeds Robert A. Dowdy, 64, who plans to retire in June. Before his retirement, Dowdy will work closely with Khoury to ensure a smooth transition. "We are extremely pleased to have a lawyer with Ken's experience and expertise join us and assume leadership of our legal department," Rogel said. "Not only does Ken possess an outstanding legal mind, he brings with him extensive management experience and knowledge of our industry which will prove valuable as he works with other leaders to chart our future direction. "All of us at Weyerhaeuser are indebted to Bob Dowdy for building an outstanding law department and helping guide us through a period of growth and change," Rogel said. "As general counsel, Bob played a lead role in all of the major acquisitions we have undertaken to position Weyerhaeuser as a global leader in our industry. But Bob's contributions go beyond his role as the leader of our Law department. As a member of our senior management team, I have always counted on Bob to provide sound counsel on all of our business decisions. We all wish him the best as he prepares to retire after distinguished service to our company." Khoury joins Weyerhaeuser from Georgia-Pacific Corporation, a privately held, wholly owned subsidiary of Koch Industries, where he served as vice president and deputy general counsel. Before joining Georgia-Pacific in 1990, Khoury held legal positions with Shearson-Lehman Brothers, The Continental Corporation, Airco, and the law firm of White & Case where he was involved in mergers and acquisitions. Khoury graduated from the Fordham University School of Law in 1977. He holds a bachelor of arts degree from Rutgers University.
