Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, Spinco and Domtar will effect a plan of arrangement in accordance with Section 192 of the Canada Business Corporation Act (the Arrangement) that will result in Spinco indirectly owning all of the outstanding common shares of Domtar, whereby each issued and outstanding common share in the capital of Domtar (a Domtar Common Share) that is not held by a holder who exercised dissent rights shall be exchanged for one Class B Common Share of Newco Canada Exchangeco, which, in turn, shall be exchanged for one share of Spinco Common Stock or, as the case may be,

Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding sentence and Section 4204 of ERISA, it is expressly agreed that if Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary incurs any secondary withdrawal liability under the preceding sentence, Newco shall indemnify and hold them harmless from any and all losses incurred by Weyerhaeuser or any Weyerhaeuser Subsidiary by reason of such secondary liability.

Intended Tax Treatment
), including not taking any action that such party knows is reasonably likely to prevent the Intended Tax Treatment.
 
SECTION 6.17.
  
Distribution.
(a) Weyerhaeuser shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that any decision to effect the Distribution, in whole or in part, as an exchange offer will be made sufficiently in advance of receipt of any Governmental Approvals such that the implementation would not reasonably be expected to delay the Closing Date by more than 30 days.
 
(b)
  
If Weyerhaeuser elects to effect the Distribution, in whole or in part, as an exchange offer, Weyerhaeuser shall use reasonable efforts to and, upon request by Weyerhaeuser, Domtar shall use reasonable efforts to consummate the Distribution within 30 days after satisfaction (or waiver to the extent permissible) of all the conditions precedent to the Closing (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the time of the Transactions and shall in fact be satisfied at such time(s)).
 
 
67
 
 
(c)
  
Weyerhaeuser shall not use an exchange offer to effect the Distribution, in whole or in part, if such exchange offer would result in occurrence of the Distribution Date 30 days beyond the date on which the Transactions would otherwise be consummated.
 
(d)
  
Weyerhaeuser shall be entitled to delay the Distribution and Closing for up to 10 Business Days to comply with any NYSE and TSX rules relating to notices of record dates and dividends.
 
SECTION 6.18.

In connection with the assignment, transfer and conveyance of the Newco Assets and the assumption of the Newco Liabilities by Newco, and the purchase of the Newco Canada Exchangeco Assets and the assumption of the Newco Canada Exchangeco Liabilities by Newco Canada Exchangeco, in each case as contemplated in the Contribution and Distribution Agreement, Weyerhaeuser (i) will keep Domtar reasonably informed of its progress in obtaining any necessary or advisable Consents and Governmental Approvals, and (ii) will not enter into any agreement or other instrument with respect to any such assignment, transfer, conveyance, assumption or purchase without the prior approval of Domtar, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
 
SECTION 6.19.
  
Covenants Regarding Non-Solicitation.
(a) Subject to Section 6.20, Domtar shall not, directly or indirectly, through any officer, director, employee, representative or agent of Domtar or any of its subsidiaries, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information or entering into any form of agreement, arrangement or understanding) the initiation of any inquiries or proposals regarding an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Weyerhaeuser the approval of the Board of Directors of Domtar of the Transactions or the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Domtar to the holders of Domtar Capital Shares, (iv) approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding related to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the preceding part of this Section 6.19(a
)
and any other provision of this Agreement, nothing shall prevent the Board of Directors of Domtar prior to the issuance of the Final Order from considering, participating in any discussions or negotiations, or entering into a confidentiality agreement and providing information pursuant to Section 6.19(c), regarding an unsolicited
bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 6.19 and that the Board of Directors of Domtar determines in good faith, after consultation with financial advisors and outside counsel, constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal;
provided,
 
however
, that prior to taking such action, the Board of Directors must have determined, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is appropriate for the Board of Directors of Domtar take such action in order to discharge properly its fiduciary duties. Domtar shall not consider, negotiate, accept, approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal after the date of the issuance of the Final Order. Domtar shall, and shall cause the officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents of Domtar and its subsidiaries to, cease immediately all discussions and negotiations conducted prior to the date of this Agreement regarding any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. Nothing contained in this Section 6.19(a) shall prohibit Domtar from responding to any unsolicited proposal or inquiry solely by advising the person making such proposal or inquiry of the terms of this Section 6.19(a).
 
 
68
 
 
(b)
  
Domtar shall promptly notify Weyerhaeuser, at first orally and then in writing, of any Acquisition Proposal and any inquiry that could lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or any amendments to the foregoing, or any request for non-public information relating to Domtar or any material Domtar Subsidiary in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books or records of Domtar or any material Domtar Subsidiary by any person that informs Domtar or such material Domtar Subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall include a description of the material terms and conditions of any proposal, the identity of the person making such proposal, inquiry or contact and provide such other details of the proposal, inquiry or contact as Weyerhaeuser may reasonably request. Domtar shall (i) keep Weyerhaeuser fully informed of the status including any change to the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide to Weyerhaeuser, as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof, copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or provided to Domtar or any Domtar Subsidiary from any person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or sent or provided by Domtar to any person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal.
 
(c)
  
If Domtar receives a request for material non-public information from a person who has made an unsolicited
bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal and Domtar is permitted, as contemplated under the second sentence of Section 6.19(a), to negotiate the terms of such Acquisition Proposal, then, and only in such case, the Board of Directors of Domtar may, subject to the execution by such person of a confidentiality agreement containing a standstill provision substantially similar to that contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, provide such person with access to information regarding Domtar;
provided,
 
however
, that the person making the Acquisition Proposal shall not be precluded under such confidentiality agreement from making the Acquisition Proposal (including any amendment thereto);
provided
 
further
that Domtar sends a copy of any such confidentiality agreement to Weyerhaeuser promptly upon its execution and Weyerhaeuser is provided with a list of or copies of the information provided to such person and immediately provided with access to similar information to which such person was provided.
 
(d)
  
Domtar shall ensure that its officers, directors and employees and its subsidiaries and their officers, directors and employees and any financial advisors or other advisors or representatives retained by it are aware of the provisions of this Section 6.19, and it shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 6.19 by its officers, directors, employees, financial advisors or other advisors or representatives.
 
(e)
  
Notwithstanding Section 6.19(a)(iii), the Board of Directors of Domtar may withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Weyerhaeuser the approval of the Board of Directors of Domtar of the transactions contemplated hereby if an event has occurred and is continuing that, either alone or together with other events, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Newco Material Adverse Effect.
 
 
 
69
 
 
SECTION 6.20.
  
Notice by Domtar of Superior Proposal Determination.
 
(a)
  
Notwithstanding Sections 6.19(a), 6.19(b), 6.19(d) and 6.19(e), Domtar may accept, approve, recommend or enter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement in respect of a Superior Proposal if, and only if, (i) it has provided Weyerhaeuser with a copy of the Superior Proposal document, (ii) five Business Days shall have elapsed from the later of the date Weyerhaeuser received written notice advising Weyerhaeuser that Domtars Board of Directors has resolved, subject only to compliance with this Section 6.20 and termination of this Agreement, to accept, approve, recommend or enter into an agreement in respect of such Superior Proposal, specifying the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the person making such Superior Proposal, and the date Weyerhaeuser received a copy of such Superior Proposal, and (iii) it has previously or concurrently will have (A) paid to Weyerhaeuser the Break Fee (as defined in Section 6.21(a)(iii)), if any, payable under Section 6.21 and (B) terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(ii). Any information provided by Domtar to Weyerhaeuser pursuant to this Section 6.20 or pursuant to Section 6.19 shall be subject to Section 6.06.
 
(b)
  
During such five Business Day period, Domtar agrees that Weyerhaeuser shall have the right, but not the obligation, to offer to amend the terms of this Agreement. The Board of Directors of Domtar will review any offer by Weyerhaeuser to amend the terms of this Agreement in good faith in order to determine, in its discretion in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, whether Weyerhaeusers offer upon acceptance by Domtar would result in such Superior Proposal ceasing to be a Superior Proposal. If the Board of Directors of Domtar so determines, it will enter into an amended agreement with Weyerhaeuser reflecting Weyerhaeusers amended proposal. If the Board of Directors of Domtar continues to believe, in good faith and after consultation with financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and therefore rejects Weyerhaeusers amended proposal, Domtar may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(ii);
provided
,
however
, that Domtar must concurrently pay to Weyerhaeuser the Break Fee, if any, payable to Weyerhaeuser under Section 6.21
 
and must concurrently with such termination enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal. Domtar acknowledges and agrees that payment of the Break Fee, if any, payable under Section 6.21 is a condition to valid termination of this Agreement under Section 8.01(d)(ii) and this Section 6.20
.
 
(c)
  
Domtar also acknowledges and agrees that each successive modification of any Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of the requirement under clause (ii) of Section 6.20(a) to initiate an additional five Business Day notice period.
 
 
 
70
 
 
SECTION 6.21.
  
Break Fee.
 
(a)
  
If:
 
(i)
  
Domtar shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(ii), unless at the time of such termination, an event has occurred and is continuing that has a Newco Material Adverse Effect;
 
(ii)
  
Weyerhaeuser shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(ii), unless at the time of such failure to recommend, withdrawal or adverse modification or change, or recommendation of an Acquisition Proposal, an event has occurred and is continuing that has a Newco Material Adverse Effect; or
 
(iii)
  
either Domtar or Weyerhaeuser shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) or 8.01(b)(ii) in circumstances where Domtar Shareholder Approval has not been obtained at the Domtar Meeting, and (x)(A) in the case of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i), a
bona fide
Acquisition Proposal has been made by any person other than a Weyerhaeuser Party prior to the Domtar Meeting and not withdrawn more than five days prior to the vote of the Domtar Shareholders, or (B) in the case of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(ii), a
bona fide
Acquisition Proposal has been made by any Person other than a Weyerhaeuser Party that is either publicly disclosed or otherwise becomes publicly known prior to or at the time of the Domtar Meeting and that is not withdrawn more than five days prior to the vote of the Domtar Shareholders, and (y) Domtar enters into an agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or any Acquisition Proposal is consummated, after the date hereof and prior to the expiration of 12 months following termination of this Agreement, unless at the time of the Domtar Meeting an event has occurred and is continuing that has a Newco Material Adverse Effect;
 
then in any such case Domtar shall pay to Weyerhaeuser $62,000,000 (the 
Break Fee
) in immediately available funds to an account designated by Weyerhaeuser. Such payment shall be due (A) in the case of a termination specified in clause (i), prior to the termination of this Agreement, (B) in the case of a termination specified in clause (ii), within five Business Days after written notice of termination by Weyerhaeuser, or (C) in the case of a termination specified in clause (iii), at or prior to the earlier of the entering into of the agreement and the consummation of the transaction referred to therein;
provided
,
however
, that in the event that Domtar has reimbursed Weyerhaeuser for its out-of-pocket expenses pursuant to Section 6.21(b) prior to the date on which the Break Fee is payable, then the amount of the Break Fee payable shall be reduced by the amount of expenses actually reimbursed by Domtar pursuant to Section 6.21(b). Domtar shall not be obligated to make more than one payment pursuant to this Section 6.21(a).
 
(b)
  
Domtar shall reimburse Weyerhaeuser for all its out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions, subject to a maximum of $10,000,000, if this Agreement is terminated in the circumstances specified in clause (iii) of Section 6.21(a) and the Break Fee is not payable upon the date of such termination. Such reimbursement shall be paid on demand following such termination.
 
 
71
 
 
SECTION 6.22.
  
Effect of Break Fee Payment.
For greater certainty, the parties hereto agree that if Domtar pays to Weyerhaeuser amounts required by Section 6.21 as a result of the occurrence of any of the events referenced in Section 6.21, the Weyerhaeuser Parties shall have no other remedy for monetary damages for any breach of this Agreement by Domtar.
 
SECTION 6.23.
  
Securities Act Exemptions
.
In the event that, due to an amendment to the Securities Act, a change in the SECs interpretation of the Securities Act or a decision of a court which provides that orders of Canadian courts such as the Final Order do not qualify under Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act, the exemption from registration under Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act is not available for any reason to exempt the issuance of the Spinco Shares and Exchangeable Shares in accordance with the Arrangement from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, then Spinco shall take all necessary action to file a registration statement on Form S-4 (or on such other form that may be available to Spinco) in order to register the shares of Spinco Common Stock and Exchangeable Shares, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective at or prior to the Effective Time. In the event that, prior to the Distribution Date, due to an amendment to the Securities Act, a change in the SECs interpretation of the Securities Act or a decision of a court, the Distribution by means of a dividend is required to be registered under the Securities Act, then Weyerhaeuser shall cause Spinco to take all necessary action to file a registration statement on Form S-1 (or such other form that may be available to Spinco) in order to register the shares of Spinco Common Stock to be distributed as a dividend and shall cause Spinco to use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective at or prior to the Distribution Date.
 
SECTION 6.24.
  
Audited Financial Statements
.
(a) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, but no later than November 15, 2006, Weyerhaeuser shall deliver to Domtar (i) audited balance sheets with respect to the Newco Business as of December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004 (together with the notes thereto, the 
Audited Newco Balance Sheets
), and the related audited statements of results of operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the three-year period ended December 25, 2005 (together with the notes thereto and the Audited Newco Balance Sheets, the 
Audited Newco Financial Statements
), which shall be substantially the same as the 2005 Unaudited Newco Financial Statements with respect to the period covered by such unaudited financial statements (except that the 2005 Unaudited Newco Financial Statements do not reflect the Canadian Logging, Forest Management and Saw Mill Operations, which shall be reflected in the Audited Newco Financial Statements), with audit adjustments that are only immaterial in amount and nature (except with respect to the Canadian Logging, Forest Management and Saw Mill Operations), (ii) an unqualified audit report on the Audited Newco Financial Statements, and (iii) a schedule showing all adjustments to the 2005 Unaudited Newco Financial Statements to reflect the Canadian Logging, Forest Management and Saw Mills Operations.
 
(b)
  
The parties hereto will cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare on a timely basis pro forma financial statements of Spinco, as adjusted to reflect the consummation of the Transactions, prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC and applicable Canadian requirements, for the periods required to be included in the Domtar Circular, the Form 10, the Spinco Registration Statement or, if such filings are required by applicable Law or the SEC, the Form S-4 or the Exchange Offer Schedule.
 
 
72
 
 
SECTION 6.25.
  
Domtar Share Purchase Plans and Domtar Stock Plans.
(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of Domtar shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to provide that with respect to the Domtar Share Purchase Plan for Canadian Employees and the Domtar Share Purchase Plan for Employees in the United States (collectively, the 
Domtar ESPPs
) (A) each participants outstanding right to purchase Domtar Common Shares under the Domtar ESPPs shall terminate on the last trading day immediately prior to the Measurement Date, (B) any amounts allocated to a participants account under the Domtar ESPPs may be used to purchase Domtar Common Shares from Domtar prior to, but not after, the close of business on the day prior to the Measurement Date, and any unused amounts shall be refunded to such participant, (C) the Domtar ESPPs shall terminate at the close of business on the day immediately prior to the Measurement Date, (D) with respect to the Domtar ESPP for Canadian employees, the annual employer contribution for the calendar year ended December 31, 2006 shall be made to participants accounts on the day immediately prior to the Measurement Date (if not previously made), and (E) no further rights shall be outstanding under the Domtar ESPPs (other than Domtar Rights relating to Domtar Common Shares previously purchased under the Domtar ESPPs). After the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Spinco may decide, at its discretion, whether it shall institute replacement share purchase plans for Spinco employees.
 
SECTION 6.26.
  
Furnishing of Tax Opinion.
At least 10 days prior to the Distribution Date, Weyerhaeuser shall furnish to Domtar a copy of the proposed form of the tax opinion described in Section 7.02(e) together with all letters or certificates that form the basis therefor (collectively, the 
Opinion Materials
).
Domtar shall be entitled to provide Weyerhaeuser with written comments on such Opinion Materials. Weyerhaeuser shall consider such comments and shall make changes to the Opinion Materials in accordance with such comments, but only to the extent that Weyerhaeuser, acting in good faith, determines that such changes are reasonable. Weyerhaeuser shall furnish Spinco with a copy of the final Opinion Materials. The Opinion Materials shall not include any letter, certificate or other item to which any Spinco Party is a signatory other than Section 6.26 of the Weyerhaeuser Disclosure Letter.
 
 
SECTION 6.27.
  
IRS Ruling.
(a) Weyerhaeuser and Spinco shall use their reasonable best efforts to seek, as promptly as practicable, a private letter ruling from the IRS, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Weyerhaeuser (the 
IRS Ruling
) to the effect that the Contribution and the Distribution shall qualify as a tax-free transaction under Sections 355 and 368 of the Code. Weyerhaeuser shall use its reasonable best efforts to notify Domtars tax counsel about any substantive telephone communications with the IRS regarding any material issues arising with respect to the IRS Ruling, so that such counsel may participate on such calls;
provided
,
however,
that if advance notification to such counsel of a call with the IRS is not practically feasible due to the initiation of an unscheduled call by the IRS, Weyerhaeuser shall first attempt to include Domtars tax counsel on such call and, if unsuccessful, shall timely inform Domtars tax counsel of any material issues discussed with the IRS subsequent to the call. Domtars tax counsel shall be allowed to participate in any in-person conference with the IRS (and Weyerhaeuser agrees to take such actions as the IRS may reasonably request in order to permit such participation), unless the IRS objects to such participation or such participation will unreasonably delay the holding of the conference. If Domtars tax counsel participates in any in-person conference with the IRS, such participation shall be for the limited purposes of providing additional facts and improving the clarity of the discussion relating to Domtar's role in the Transactions.
 
 
73
 
 
(b)
  
The IRS Ruling may be based upon customary factual statements, representations and covenants by the parties, their subsidiaries and their shareholders, consistent with the existing published guidance of the IRS, in each case with appropriate modifications to reflect the particular facts of the Transactions (collectively, the 
Representations
). Subject to, and consistent with, Section 6.06, Domtar agrees to provide such appropriate information and Representations as the IRS shall reasonably request in connection with the IRS Ruling. In the event that the IRS will not issue the ruling requested by Weyerhaeuser, then Weyerhaeuser and Domtar shall consider in good faith any reasonable modifications to the structure of the Transactions that will facilitate receipt of the IRS Ruling, so long as such modifications will not materially adversely affect the value of the Transactions to either party or its shareholders.
 
(c)
  
Weyerhaeuser shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of the request for the IRS Ruling and supplements thereto to be submitted to the IRS in connection with the IRS Ruling (the 
IRS Submission
). Prior to submitting any IRS Submission, Weyerhaeuser shall provide Domtars tax counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on a draft of such IRS Submission;
provided
,
however
, Weyerhaeuser may redact from such draft of such IRS Submission any information that (x) Weyerhaeuser, in its good faith judgment, considers to be confidential information not germane to the IRS Ruling and to which Domtar is not otherwise entitled to have access to pursuant to Section 6.06 and (y) is not (and is not reasonably expected to become) a part of any other publicly available information.
Weyerhaeuser shall timely provide to Domtars tax counsel a final copy of any IRS Submission.
 
(d)
  
Weyerhaeuser shall timely provide Domtar and its tax counsel with a copy of the IRS Ruling after receipt thereof from the IRS.
 
SECTION 6.28.
  
Equity Calculation.
On the Measurement Date, Weyerhaeuser shall provide Domtar with all relevant information regarding elections by Rollover Employees to receive Substituted Spinco Options, Substituted Spinco SARs, Substituted Spinco RSUs and the number of shares of Spinco Common Stock issuable pursuant thereto, and Domtar shall provide Weyerhaeuser with a statement setting forth the total number of Domtar Common Shares then issued and outstanding and all relevant information with respect to (i) the Domtar Restricted Shares and the number of additional Domtar Common Shares issuable pursuant thereto, and (ii) the Domtar Options, Domtar Rights, Domtar DSUs, Domtar PSUs and the number of Domtar Common Shares to be granted pursuant thereto, in each case for the purpose of determining the number of shares of Spinco Common Stock to be issued to Weyerhaeuser on the Contribution Date in accordance with Section 2.12(b) of the Contribution and Distribution Agreement. On the basis of this information, Weyerhaeuser and Domtar shall calculate in good faith the number of shares of Spinco Common Stock to be issued to Weyerhaeuser pursuant to such Section 2.12. Weyerhaeuser shall determine the Measurement Date in accordance with Section 2.12(b) of the Contribution and Distribution Agreement and shall provide Domtar with three Business Days prior notice of such date.
 
 
74
 
 
SECTION 6.29.

SECTION 6.30.
  
Confidentiality.
(a) Domtar and its affiliates acknowledge that the information being provided to them in connection with the Transactions is subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, which are incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to information relating solely to the Newco Business;
provided
,
however,
that Domtar acknowledges that any and all other information provided to it by Weyerhaeuser, any of its affiliates or their respective representatives concerning Weyerhaeuser or any of its affiliates shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing.
 
(b)
  
Weyerhaeuser shall keep confidential, and cause its affiliates and instruct its and their officers, directors, employees and advisors to keep confidential, all information relating to the Newco Business except as required by law or administrative process and except for information which is available to the public on the Closing Date, or thereafter becomes available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this Section 6.30(b). The covenants set forth in this Section 6.30 shall terminate two years after the Closing Date.
 
SECTION 6.31.
  
Internal Controls.
The parties hereto will cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to (A) design a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting by Spinco after the Effective Time, and the preparation of financial statements of Spinco after the Effective Time for external purposes, and (B) design disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information that Spinco will be required to disclose after the Effective Time in the reports it is required to file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to Spincos management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of Spinco required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act
).

The Corporation may pay the expenses incurred in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition; any advance payments to be paid by the Corporation within 20 calendar days after the receipt by the Corporation of a statement or statements from the claimant requesting such advance or advances from time to time;
provided
,
however
, that, to the extent the DGCL requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a Director or officer in such persons capacity as a Director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a Director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a Proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such Director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such Director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 7.02 or otherwise. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and rights to have the Corporation pay the expenses incurred in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition, to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article VII with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of Directors and officers of the Corporation.

(b)
  
Right of Claimant to Bring Suit
. If a claim under paragraph (a) of this Section 7.02 is not paid in full by the Corporation within 30 calendar days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct which makes it permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because the claimant has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
 
(c)
  
Non-Exclusivity of Rights
. The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Section 7.02 shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation), By-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise. No repeal or modification of this Article VII shall in any way diminish or adversely affect the rights of any Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation hereunder in respect of any occurrence or matter arising prior to any such repeal or modification.
 
(d)
  
Insurance
. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.
 
(a)
  
Severability
. If any provision or provisions of this Article VII shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article VII (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Article VII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article VII (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Article VII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

or any provision of provincial, state, local or foreign tax law, in each case, as amended or succeeded or (ii) required or permitted in order to comply with Section 116 of the ITA or any corresponding provisions of provincial law.

So long as any of the Exchangeable Shares are outstanding, the Corporation shall not at any time without, but may at any time with, the approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given as specified in section 
3.10.2
of these share provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
The restrictions in sections 
3.4.1(a)
,
(b)
,
(c)
, and
(d)
above shall not apply if all dividends on the outstanding Exchangeable Shares corresponding to dividends declared and paid to date on the shares of Spinco Common Stock shall have been declared and paid on the Exchangeable Shares.
 
 
3.5.1
  
In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation or any other distribution of the assets of the Corporation among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs, a holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled, subject to applicable law, to receive from the assets of the Corporation in respect of each Exchangeable Share held by such holder on the effective date (the
Liquidation Date
) of such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, before any distribution of any part of the assets of the Corporation among the holders of the Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares, an amount per Exchangeable Share (the
Liquidation Amount
) equal to the Current Market Price of a share of Spinco Common Stock on the last Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date, which shall be satisfied in full by the Corporation causing to be delivered to such holder, for each such Exchangeable Share, one share of Spinco Common Stock plus an amount equal to all declared and unpaid dividends on each such Exchangeable Share held by such holder on any dividend record date which occurred prior to the Liquidation Date.
 
 
D-32
 
 
3.5.2
  
On or promptly after the Liquidation Date, and subject to the exercise by Newco Canada of the Liquidation Call Right, the Corporation shall cause to be delivered to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares the Liquidation Amount for each such Exchangeable Share upon presentation and surrender of the certificates representing such Exchangeable Shares, if any, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of such Exchangeable Shares and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent and the Corporation may reasonably require, at the registered office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares. Payment of the total Liquidation Amount for such Exchangeable Shares shall be made by delivery to each holder, at the address of the holder recorded in the securities register of the Corporation for the Exchangeable Shares or by holding for pick-up by the holder at the registered office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares, on behalf of the Corporation, of the shares of Spinco Common Stock to which the holder is entitled (which shares shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance), either in the form of certificates representing the shares of Spinco Common Stock or, in whole or in part, in book-entry form through the direct registration system and, if applicable, a cheque of the Corporation payable at par at any branch of the bankers of the Corporation in respect of the remaining portion, if any, of the total Liquidation Amount (in each case less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom). On and after the Liquidation Date, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall cease to be holders of such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of holders in respect thereof, other than the right to receive their proportionate part of the total Liquidation Amount, unless payment of the total Liquidation Amount for such Exchangeable Shares shall not be made upon presentation and surrender of the documents and instruments required in accordance with the foregoing provisions, in which case the rights of the holders shall remain unaffected until the total Liquidation Amount has been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. The Corporation shall have the right at any time after the Liquidation Date to deposit or cause to be deposited the total Liquidation Amount in a custodial account with any chartered bank or trust company in Canada. Upon such deposit being made, the rights of the holders of Exchangeable Shares after such deposit shall be limited to receiving their proportionate part of the total Liquidation Amount (in each case less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom) for such Exchangeable Shares so deposited, against presentation and surrender of the required documents and instruments in accordance with the foregoing provisions. Upon such payment or deposit of the total Liquidation Amount, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be holders of the shares of Spinco Common Stock delivered to them or the custodian on their behalf.
 
3.5.3
  
After the Corporation has satisfied its obligations to pay the holders of the Exchangeable Shares the Liquidation Amount per Exchangeable Share pursuant to section 
3.5.1
of these share provisions, such holders shall not be entitled to share in any further distribution of the assets of the Corporation.
 
 
3.6.1
  
A holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled at any time, subject to the exercise by Newco Canada of the Retraction Call Right and otherwise upon compliance with the provisions of this Article 
3.6
, to require the Corporation to redeem any or all of the Exchangeable Shares registered in the name of such holder for an amount per Exchangeable Share equal to the Current Market Price of a share of Spinco Common Stock on the last Business Day prior to the Retraction Date (the 
Retraction Price
), which shall be satisfied in full by the Corporation causing to be delivered to such holder, for each Exchangeable Share presented and surrendered by the holder, one share of Spinco Common Stock. To effect such redemption, the holder shall present and surrender at the registered office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares the certificate or certificates, if any, representing the Exchangeable Shares which the holder desires to have the Corporation redeem, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent and the Corporation may reasonably require, and together with a duly executed statement (the 
Retraction Request
) in the form of Schedule A hereto or in such other form as may be acceptable to the Corporation:
 
 
D-33
 
 
 
 
 
3.6.2
  
Subject to the exercise by Newco Canada of the Retraction Call Right, upon receipt by the Corporation or the Transfer Agent in the manner specified in section 
3.6.1
hereof of a certificate or certificates, if any, representing the number of Retracted Shares, together with a Retraction Request and the other documents and instruments required in accordance with section 
3.6.1
, and provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in section 
3.6.7
, the Corporation shall redeem the Retracted Shares effective at the close of business on the Retraction Date and shall cause to be delivered to such holder the total Retraction Price. If only a part of the Exchangeable Shares is redeemed (or purchased by Newco Canada pursuant to the Retraction Call Right), the holder thereof shall receive at the expense of the Corporation (either in the form of a certificate, or in book-entry form through the direct registration system) the balance of such Exchangeable Shares.
 
 
D-34
 
 
3.6.3
  
Upon receipt by the Corporation of a Retraction Request, the Corporation shall immediately notify Newco Canada thereof and shall provide to Newco Canada a copy of the Retraction Request. In order to exercise the Retraction Call Right, Newco Canada must notify the Corporation of its determination to do so (the 
Newco Canada Call Notice
) within five Business Days of notification to Newco Canada by the Corporation of the receipt by the Corporation of the Retraction Request. If Newco Canada does not so notify the Corporation within such five Business Day period, the Corporation will notify the holder as soon as possible thereafter that Newco Canada will not exercise the Retraction Call Right. If Newco Canada delivers the Newco Canada Call Notice within such five Business Day period, and provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in section 
3.6.7
, the Retraction Request shall thereupon be considered only to be an offer by the holder to sell the Retracted Shares to Newco Canada in accordance with the Retraction Call Right. In such event, the Corporation shall not redeem the Retracted Shares and Newco Canada shall purchase from such holder and such holder shall sell to Newco Canada on the Retraction Date the Retracted Shares for a purchase price (the 
Purchase Price
) per share equal to the Retraction Price per share, plus on the designated payment date therefor, to the extent not paid by the Corporation on the designated payment date therefor, any Dividend Amount. To the extent that Newco Canada pays the Dividend Amount in respect of the Retracted Shares, the Corporation shall no longer be obligated to pay any declared and unpaid dividends on such Retracted Shares. Provided that Newco Canada has complied with section 
3.6.4
, the closing of the purchase and sale of the Retracted Shares pursuant to the Retraction Call Right shall be deemed to have occurred as at the close of business on the Retraction Date and, for greater certainty, no redemption by the Corporation of such Retracted Shares shall take place on the Retraction Date. In the event that Newco Canada does not deliver a Newco Canada Call Notice within such five Business Day period, and provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in section 
3.6.7
, the Corporation shall redeem the Retracted Shares on the Retraction Date and in the manner otherwise contemplated in this Article 
3.6
.
 
3.6.4
  
The Corporation or Newco Canada, as the case may be, shall deliver or cause the Transfer Agent to deliver to the relevant holder, at the address of the holder recorded in the securities register of the Corporation for the Exchangeable Shares or at the address specified in the holders Retraction Request or by holding for pick-up by the holder at the registered office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares, the shares of Spinco Common Stock to which the holder is entitled (which shares shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance), either in the form of certificates representing the shares of Spinco Common Stock registered in the name of the holder or in such other name as the holder may request or, in whole or in part, in book-entry form through the direct registration system, and, if applicable and on or before the payment date therefor, a cheque payable at par at any branch of the bankers of the Corporation or Newco Canada, as applicable, representing the aggregate Dividend Amount, in payment of the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, in each case, less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom, and such delivery of such shares of Spinco Common Stock and cheques on behalf of the Corporation or by Newco Canada, as the case may be, or by the Transfer Agent shall be deemed to be payment of and shall satisfy and discharge all liability for the total Retraction Price or total Purchase Price, as the case may be, to the extent that the same is represented by such shares of Spinco Common Stock and cheques (plus any tax deducted and withheld therefrom and remitted to the proper tax authority).
 
 
D-35
 
 
3.6.5
  
On and after the close of business on the Retraction Date, the holder of the Retracted Shares shall cease to be a holder of such Retracted Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a holder in respect thereof, other than the right to receive his proportionate part of the total Retraction Price or total Purchase Price, as the case may be, unless upon presentation and surrender of the documents and instruments in accordance with the foregoing provisions, payment of the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, shall not be made as provided in section 
3.6.4
, in which case the rights of such holder shall remain unaffected until the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, has been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. On and after the close of business on the Retraction Date, provided that presentation and surrender of the documents and instruments in accordance with the foregoing provisions and payment of the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, has been made in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the holder of the Retracted Shares so redeemed by the Corporation or purchased by Newco Canada shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be a holder of the shares of Spinco Common Stock delivered to it.
 
3.6.6
  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 
3.6
, the Corporation shall not be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a holder in a Retraction Request to the extent that such redemption of Retracted Shares would be contrary to solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable law. If the Corporation believes that on any Retraction Date it would not be permitted by any of such provisions to redeem the Retracted Shares tendered for redemption on such date, and provided that Newco Canada shall not have exercised the Retraction Call Right with respect to the Retracted Shares, the Corporation shall only be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a holder in a Retraction Request to the extent of the maximum number that may be so redeemed (rounded down to a whole number of shares) as would not be contrary to such provisions and shall notify the holder and the Trustee at least two Business Days prior to the Retraction Date as to the number of Retracted Shares which will not be redeemed by the Corporation. In any case in which the redemption by the Corporation of Retracted Shares would be contrary to solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable law, the Corporation shall redeem Retracted Shares in accordance with section 
3.6.2
of these share provisions on a
pro rata
basis and the holder of Retracted Shares shall receive at the Corporations expense (either in the form of a certificate or in book-entry form through the direct registration system) the Retracted Shares not redeemed by the Corporation pursuant to section 
3.6.2
. Provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in section 
3.6.7
, the holder of any such Retracted Shares not redeemed by the Corporation pursuant to section 
3.6.2
of these share provisions as a result of solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable law shall be deemed by giving the Retraction Request to require Newco Canada, to purchase such Retracted Shares from such holder on the Retraction Date or as soon as practicable thereafter on payment by Newco Canada as the case may be, to such holder of the Purchase Price for each such Retracted Share, all as more specifically provided in the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement.
 
3.6.7
  
A holder of Retracted Shares may, by notice in writing given by the holder to the Corporation before the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Retraction Date, withdraw its Retraction Request, in which event such Retraction Request shall be null and void and, for greater certainty, the revocable offer constituted by the Retraction Request to sell the Retracted Shares to Newco Canada shall be deemed to have been revoked.
 
 
D-36
 
 
 
3.7.1
  
Subject to applicable law, and provided Newco Canada has not exercised the Redemption Call Right, the Corporation shall on the Redemption Date redeem all but not less than all of the then outstanding Exchangeable Shares for an amount per Exchangeable Share equal to the Current Market Price of a share of Spinco Common Stock on the last Business Day prior to the Redemption Date (the 
Redemption Price
), which shall be satisfied in full by the Corporation causing to be delivered to each holder of Exchangeable Shares, for each Exchangeable Share held by such holder, one share of Spinco Common Stock, together with the full amount of all declared and unpaid dividends on each such Exchangeable Share held by such holder on any dividend record date which occurred prior to the Redemption Date.
 
3.7.2
  
In any case of a redemption of Exchangeable Shares under this Article 
3.7
, the Corporation shall, at least 60 days before the Redemption Date (other than a Redemption Date established in connection with a Spinco Control Transaction, an Exchangeable Share Voting Event or an Exempt Exchangeable Share Voting Event), send or cause to be sent to each holder of Exchangeable Shares a notice in writing of the redemption by the Corporation or the purchase by Newco Canada under the Redemption Call Right, as the case may be, of the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder. In the case of a Redemption Date established in connection with a Spinco Control Transaction, an Exchangeable Share Voting Event or an Exempt Exchangeable Share Voting Event, the written notice of redemption by the Corporation or the purchase by Newco Canada under the Redemption Call Right will be sent on or before the Redemption Date, on as many days prior written notice as may be determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation to be reasonably practicable in the circumstances. In any such case, such notice shall set out the formula for determining the Redemption Price or the Redemption Call Purchase Price, as the case may be, the Redemption Date and, if applicable, particulars of the Redemption Call Right.
 
3.7.3
  
On or after the Redemption Date and subject to the exercise by Newco Canada of the Redemption Call Right, the Corporation shall cause to be delivered to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares to be redeemed the Redemption Price for each such Exchangeable Share, if any, together with the full amount of all declared and unpaid dividends on each such Exchangeable Share held by such holder on any dividend record date which occurred prior to the Redemption Date, upon presentation and surrender at the registered office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation in such notice of the certificates representing such Exchangeable Shares, if any, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent and the Corporation may reasonably require. Payment of the total Redemption Price for such Exchangeable Shares, together with payment of such dividends, shall be made by delivery to each holder, at the address of the holder recorded in the securities register of the Corporation or by holding for pick-up by the holder at the registered office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation in such notice, on behalf of the Corporation, of the shares of Spinco Common Stock to which the holder is entitled (which shares shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance), either in the form of certificates representing the shares of Spinco Common Stock or, in whole or in part, in book-entry form through the direct registration system, and, if applicable, a cheque of the Corporation payable at par at any branch of the bankers of the Corporation in payment of any such dividends, in each case, less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom. On and after the Redemption Date, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares called for redemption shall cease to be holders of such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of holders in respect thereof, other than the right to receive their proportionate part of the total Redemption Price and any such dividends, unless payment of the total Redemption Price and any such dividends for such Exchangeable Shares shall not be made upon presentation and surrender of the documents and instruments required in accordance with the foregoing provisions, in which case the rights of the holders shall remain unaffected until the total Redemption Price and any such dividends have been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. The Corporation shall have the right at any time after the sending of notice of its intention to redeem the Exchangeable Shares as aforesaid to deposit or cause to be deposited the total Redemption Price for and the full amount of such dividends on (except as otherwise provided in this section 
3.7.3
) the Exchangeable Shares so called for redemption, in a custodial account with any chartered bank or trust company in Canada named in such notice, less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom. Upon the later of such deposit being made and the Redemption Date, the Exchangeable Shares in respect whereof such deposit shall have been made shall be redeemed and the rights of the holders thereof after such deposit or Redemption Date, as the case may be, shall be limited to receiving their proportionate part of the total Redemption Price and such dividends for such Exchangeable Shares so called for redemption, against presentation and surrender of the documents and instruments required in accordance with the foregoing provisions. Upon such payment or deposit of the total Redemption Price and the full amount of such dividends, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be holders of the shares of Spinco Common Stock delivered to them or the custodian on their behalf.
 
 
D-37
 
 
 
3.8.1
  
Subject to applicable law and notwithstanding section 
3.8.2
, the Corporation may at any time and from time to time purchase for cancellation all or any part of the Exchangeable Shares by private agreement with any holder of Exchangeable Shares for consideration consisting of Common Shares.
 
3.8.2
  
Subject to applicable law, the Corporation may at any time and from time to time purchase for cancellation all or any part of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares at any price by tender to all the holders of record of Exchangeable Shares then outstanding or through the facilities of any stock exchange on which the Exchangeable Shares are listed or quoted at any price per share. If in response to an invitation for tenders under the provisions of this section 
3.8.2
, more Exchangeable Shares are tendered at a price or prices acceptable to the Corporation than the Corporation is prepared to purchase, the Exchangeable Shares to be purchased by the Corporation shall be purchased as nearly as may be
pro rata
according to the number of shares tendered by each holder who submits a tender to the Corporation, provided that when shares are tendered at different prices, the pro rating shall be effected (disregarding fractions) only with respect to the shares tendered at the price at which more shares were tendered than the Corporation is prepared to purchase after the Corporation has purchased all the shares tendered at lower prices. If part only of the Exchangeable Shares shall be purchased, the holder thereof shall receive at the expense of the Corporation (either in the form of a certificate or in book-entry form through the direct registration system) the balance of such shares.
 
 
3.9.1
  
Except as required by applicable law and by Article 
3.10

3.10.1
  
The rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching to the Exchangeable Shares may be added to, changed or removed but only with the approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given as hereinafter specified, provided that any adjustment to the number of shares of Spinco Common Stock into which an Exchangeable Share is exchangeable (which initially is one) made by the Board of Directors in accordance with section 2.7 of the Support Agreement to reflect the effect of any Distribution or Change in order to implement the required economic equivalent with respect to the shares of Spinco Common Stock and the Exchangeable Shares shall not require the approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares.
 
3.10.2
  
Any approval given by the holders of the Exchangeable Shares to add to, change or remove any right, privilege, restriction or condition attaching to the Exchangeable Shares or any other matter requiring the approval or consent of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall be deemed to have been sufficiently given if it shall have been given in accordance with applicable law subject to a minimum requirement that such approval be evidenced by a resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the votes cast on such resolution at a meeting of holders of Exchangeable Shares duly called and held at which the holders of at least 25% of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares at that time are present or represented by proxy; provided that if at any such meeting the holders of at least 25% of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares at that time are not present or represented by proxy within one-half hour after the time appointed for such meeting, then the meeting shall be adjourned to such date not less than five days thereafter and to such time and place as may be designated by the Chairman of such meeting. At such adjourned meeting the holders of Exchangeable Shares present or represented by proxy thereat may transact the business for which the meeting was originally called and a resolution passed thereat by the affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the votes cast on such resolution at such meeting shall constitute the approval or consent of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares.

(each such event, a 
Distribution
), unless the same or the economic equivalent on a per share basis of such rights, options, securities, shares, evidences of indebtedness or other assets is issued or distributed simultaneously to holders of the Exchangeable Shares.
 
3.11.2
  
Each holder of an Exchangeable Share acknowledges that the Support Agreement further provides, in part, that Spinco will not without the prior approval of the Corporation and the prior approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with section

of these share provisions:
 
 
 
 
(each such event, a 
Change
), unless the same or an economically equivalent change shall simultaneously be made to, or in, the rights of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares. The Support Agreement further provides, in part, that the aforesaid provisions of the Support Agreement shall not be changed without the approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with section

3.13.2
  
Each holder of an Exchangeable Share, whether of record or beneficial, by virtue of becoming and being such a holder shall be deemed to acknowledge each of the Liquidation Call Right, the Retraction Call Right and the Redemption Call Right, in each case, in favour of Newco Canada, and the overriding nature thereof in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation or the retraction or redemption of Exchangeable Shares, as the case may be, and to be bound thereby in favour of Newco Canada as therein provided.

3.13.3
  
The Corporation and Newco Canada shall be entitled, and may instruct the Transfer Agent, to deduct and withhold from any dividend or consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Exchangeable Shares such amounts as the Corporation or Newco Canada is required or permitted to deduct and withhold with respect to such payments under (i) the

or any provision of provincial, state, local or foreign tax law, in each case, as amended or succeeded or (ii) required or permitted in order to comply with Section 116 of the

, the closing of the transaction of purchase and sale contemplated by the Exchange Right shall be deemed to have occurred and the holder of such Exchangeable Shares shall be deemed to have transferred to Newco Canada, all of such holders right, title and interest in and to such Exchangeable Shares and the related interest in the Trust Estate and shall cease to be a holder of such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a holder in respect thereof, other than the right to receive his proportionate part of the total purchase price therefor, unless the requisite number of shares of Spinco Common Stock is not allotted, issued and delivered by Newco Canada, to the Trustee within five Business Days of the date of the giving of such notice by the Trustee or the balance of the purchase price, if any, is not paid by Newco Canada, on the applicable payment date therefor, in which case the rights of the Beneficiary shall remain unaffected until such shares of Spinco Common Stock are so allotted, issued and delivered, and the balance of the purchase price, if any, has been paid, by Newco Canada. Upon delivery by Newco Canada, to the Trustee of such shares of Spinco Common Stock, and the balance of the purchase price, if any, the Trustee shall deliver such shares of Spinco Common Stock to such Beneficiary (or to such other persons, if any, properly designated by such Beneficiary), either in the form of a certificate or in book-entry form through the direct registration system. Concurrently with such Beneficiary ceasing to be a holder of Exchangeable Shares, the Beneficiary shall be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holder of the shares of Spinco Common Stock delivered to it pursuant to the Exchange Right.

In the event that a Beneficiary has exercised its right under Article 3.6 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions to require Newco Canada Exchangeco to redeem any or all of the Exchangeable Shares held by the Beneficiary (the
Retracted Shares
) and is notified by Newco Canada Exchangeco pursuant to section 3.6.6 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions that Newco Canada Exchangeco will not be permitted as a result of solvency requirements of applicable law to redeem all such Retracted Shares, and provided that Newco Canada shall not have exercised the Retraction Call Right with respect to the Retracted Shares and that the Beneficiary has not revoked the retraction request delivered by the Beneficiary to Newco Canada Exchangeco pursuant to section 3.6.1 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions and provided further that the Trustee has received written notice of same from Newco Canada Exchangeco or Spinco, the retraction request will constitute and will be deemed to constitute notice from the Beneficiary to the Trustee instructing the Trustee to exercise the Exchange Right with respect to those Retracted Shares that Newco Canada Exchangeco is unable to redeem. In any such event, Newco Canada Exchangeco hereby agrees with the Trustee and in favour of the Beneficiary promptly to forward or cause to be forwarded to the Trustee all relevant materials delivered by the Beneficiary to Newco Canada Exchangeco or to the transfer agent of the Exchangeable Shares (including without limitation, a copy of the retraction request delivered pursuant to section 3.6.1 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions) in connection with such proposed redemption of the Retracted Shares and the Trustee will thereupon exercise the Exchange Right with respect to the Retracted Shares that Newco Canada Exchangeco is not permitted to redeem and will require Newco Canada to purchase such shares in accordance with the provisions of this
Article 5

Upon any sale of Exchangeable Shares to Newco Canada pursuant to the Exchange Right or the Automatic Exchange Rights, the shares of Spinco Common Stock to be delivered in connection with the payment of the total purchase price therefor shall be issued in the name of the Beneficiary of the Exchangeable Shares so sold or in such names as such Beneficiary may otherwise direct in writing without charge to the holder of the Exchangeable Shares so sold; provided, however, that such Beneficiary (a) shall pay (and none of Spinco, Newco Canada, Newco Canada Exchangeco or the Trustee shall be required to pay) any documentary, stamp, transfer or other taxes that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of such shares to a person other than such Beneficiary or (b) shall have evidenced to the satisfaction of the Trustee, Spinco, Newco Canada and Newco Canada Exchangeco that such taxes, if any, have been paid.
 
 
As soon as practicable following the occurrence of an Insolvency Event or any event that with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both would be an Insolvency Event, Newco Canada Exchangeco and Spinco shall give written notice thereof to the Trustee. As soon as practicable following the receipt of notice from Newco Canada Exchangeco and Spinco of the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, or upon the Trustee becoming aware of an Insolvency Event, the Trustee will mail to each Beneficiary, at the expense of Spinco (such funds to be received in advance), a notice of such Insolvency Event in the form provided by Spinco, which notice shall contain a brief statement of the rights of the Beneficiaries with respect to the Exchange Right.

Spinco will in good faith expeditiously take all such actions and do all such things as are reasonably necessary or desirable to cause all shares of Spinco Common Stock (or such other shares or securities) to be delivered pursuant to the Exchange Right or the Automatic Exchange Rights to be listed, quoted or posted for trading on all stock exchanges and quotation systems on which outstanding shares of Spinco Common Stock (or such other shares or securities) have been listed by Spinco and remain listed and are quoted or posted for trading at such time.

Spinco, Newco Canada, Newco Canada Exchangeco and the Trustee shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any dividend or any consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of Exchangeable Shares or shares of Spinco Common Stock such amounts as Spinco, Newco Canada, Newco Canada Exchangeco or the Trustee is required or permitted to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under (i) the
Income Tax Act
(Canada) (the 
ITA
), the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986
or any provision of provincial, state, local or foreign tax law, in each case as amended or succeeded or (ii) required or permitted in order to comply with section 116 of the ITA or any corresponding provisions of provincial laws. The Trustee may act on the advice of counsel with respect to such matters. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the holder of the shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that the amount so required to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a holder exceeds the cash portion of the consideration otherwise payable to the holder, Spinco, Newco Canada, Newco Canada Exchangeco and the Trustee are hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of such portion of the consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to Spinco, Newco Canada, Newco Canada Exchangeco or the Trustee, as the case may be, to enable it to comply with such deduction or withholding requirement and Spinco, Newco Canada, Newco Canada Exchangeco or the Trustee shall notify the holder thereof and remit to such holder any unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such sale. Each of Spinco and Newco Canada represents and warrants that, based upon facts currently known to it, it has no current intention, as at the date of this Agreement, to deduct or withhold from any dividend paid to holders of Exchangeable Shares any amounts under the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

Spinco, Newco Canada and Newco Canada Exchangeco jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Trustee and each of its directors, officers, employees and agents appointed and acting in accordance with this Agreement (collectively, the
Indemnified Parties
) against all claims, losses, damages, reasonable costs, penalties, fines and reasonable expenses (including reasonable expenses of the Trustees legal counsel) which, without fraud, negligence, recklessness, wilful misconduct or bad faith on the part of such Indemnified Party, may be paid, incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Party by reason or as a result of the Trustees acceptance or administration of the Trust, its compliance with its duties set forth in this Agreement, or any written or oral instruction delivered to the Trustee by Spinco, Newco Canada or Newco Canada Exchangeco pursuant hereto.
 
In no case shall Spinco, Newco Canada or Newco Canada Exchangeco be liable under this indemnity for any claim against any of the Indemnified Parties unless Spinco, Newco Canada and Newco Canada Exchangeco shall be notified by the Trustee of the written assertion of a claim or of any action commenced against the Indemnified Parties, promptly after any of the Indemnified Parties shall have received any such written assertion of a claim or shall have been served with a summons or other first legal process giving information as to the nature and basis of the claim. Subject to clause (ii) below, Spinco, Newco Canada and Newco Canada Exchangeco shall be entitled to participate at their own expense in the defence and, if Spinco, Newco Canada and Newco Canada Exchangeco so elect at any time after receipt of such notice, any of them may assume the defence of any suit brought to enforce any such claim.

The Trustee, or any Trustee hereafter appointed, may at any time resign by giving written notice of such resignation to Spinco, Newco Canada and Newco Canada Exchangeco specifying the date on which it desires to resign, provided that such notice shall not be given less than sixty (60) days before such desired resignation date unless Spinco, Newco Canada and Newco Canada Exchangeco otherwise agree and provided further that such resignation shall not take effect until the date of the appointment of a successor trustee and the acceptance of such appointment by the successor trustee.

provided
,
however
, that prior to adopting, modifying or amending any employee stock purchase agreement or equity compensation plan (but not for each issuance of Spinco Capital Stock pursuant thereto) Spinco must first obtain (at its expense) an Unqualified Tax Opinion that any issuance of capital stock of Spinco treated as equity in Spinco for U.S. federal income tax purposes under such new, modified or amended agreement or plan would meet the requirements of Safe Harbor VIII; and (z) issuances of Spinco Capital Stock described in and meeting the requirements of Safe Harbor IX (relating to the acquisition by a retirement plan of an employer) of Treasury Regulation Section 1.355-7(d);
 
     (ii)
   
   
   
   
   
  
  
liquidate Spinco or reclassify Spinco as other than a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or
 
     (iii)

H-14
 
 
 
 
     (i)
   
   
   
   
   
  
  
Clauses (i) through (iii) of paragraph (b) shall not apply to Spinco upon the prior written consent of Weyerhaeuser, which consent may not be withheld if Weyerhaeuser determines in good faith that Spinco has provided it
with Satisfactory Guidance concluding that the proposed actions will not result in incremental U.S. federal Transaction Taxes.
 
     (ii)
   
   
   
   
   
  
  
In reliance on the representation and warranty provided by Weyerhaeuser in Section 4.01(a)(iii), Spinco shall be permitted to issue Spinco Capital Stock beginning on the day after the one year anniversary of the Distribution Date,
provided
that (a) Spinco must first obtain (at its expense) an Unqualified Tax Opinion that is reasonably acceptable to Weyerhaeuser (such acceptance to be notified by Weyerhaeuser to Spinco in writing within five business days from receipt by Weyerhaeuser of such Unqualified Tax Opinion, it being understood that Weyerhaeuser shall be considered to have waived its rights to receive an Unqualified Tax Opinion under this Section 4.02(c)(ii) if it fails to indicate either its acceptance of, or objection to, the Unqualified Tax Opinion within such five business days or fails to reaffirm in writing to the Tax Advisor preparing such Unqualified Tax Opinion the representation and warranty provided by Weyerhaeuser in Section 4.01(a)(iii) within five business days of request therefor) that such issuance would meet the requirements of Safe Harbor III of Treasury Regulation Section 1.355-7(d); (b) such Unqualified Tax Opinion is based on the representation and warranty provided by Domtar in Section 4.01(b); and (c) such Unqualified Tax Opinion is based on a representation and warranty by Spinco that none of Spinco, its Subsidiaries or any Controlling Shareholder of Spinco (including any officers or directors acting on behalf of Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person acting with the implicit or explicit permission of any such officers, directors or Controlling Shareholder) has had any agreements, understandings, arrangements or substantial negotiations as determined for purposes of Code Section 355(e) and the Treasury Regulations thereunder concerning such issuance or any similar issuance of Spinco Capital Stock during the one year period beginning on the Distribution Date. The sole basis for an Unqualified Tax Opinion provided under this Section 4.02(c)(ii) not to be reasonably acceptable to Weyerhaeuser shall be on grounds that the letter or certificate provided by Spinco in connection with such Unqualified Tax Opinion was manifestly incorrect as to fact or that the Unqualified Tax Opinion was manifestly incorrect as to law. Nothing in this Section 4.02(c)(ii) shall be construed to relieve the Spinco Group of any liability under Section 2.02 of this Agreement resulting from such acquisition or issuance of Spinco Capital Stock except to the extent that such liability is attributable to a breach of the representation and warranty provided by Weyerhaeuser in Section 4.01(a)(iii).
 
     (iii)
   
   
   
   
   
  
  
The Spinco Group shall be permitted to issue or transfer Spinco Capital Stock to any Person to the extent such issuance or transfer is required or expressly permitted under any option, right, privilege or similar instrument existing as of immediately after the Closing Date.
 
     (iv)
   
   
   
   
   
  
  
The Spinco Group shall be permitted to take any action (or not take an action) required or expressly permitted under any Transaction Document (other than this Agreement) or described in the IRS Ruling.

Spinco shall reimburse Weyerhaeuser for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Weyerhaeuser in obtaining Satisfactory Guidance.

The Statement.
Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Weyerhaeuser shall prepare and deliver to Spinco a statement (the 
Statement
), setting forth (i) Working Capital of the Newco Business as of the close of business on the day prior to the Closing Date (
Closing Working Capital
), and (ii) the amounts of Shared Inventory, Shared Accounts Receivable and Shared Accounts Payable as of the close of business on the day prior to the Closing Date. Spinco shall provide reasonable assistance to Weyerhaeuser in the preparation of the Statement and shall provide Weyerhaeuser reasonable access at all reasonable times to the personnel, properties, books and records of the Newco Business for such purpose.
 
(b)
  
Objections; Resolution of Disputes.
The Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on the 30th day following delivery thereof, unless Spinco gives written notice of its disagreement with the Statement (a 
Notice of Disagreement
) to Weyerhaeuser prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall (i) specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted, and (ii) only include disagreements based on mathematical errors or based on Closing Working Capital not being calculated in accordance with this Section 2.04. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by Weyerhaeuser in a timely manner, then the Statement (as revised in accordance with this sentence) shall become final and binding upon Weyerhaeuser and Spinco on the earlier of (A) the date Weyerhaeuser and Spinco resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, and (B) the date any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm. During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Weyerhaeuser and Spinco shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such 30-day period, Weyerhaeuser and Spinco shall submit to an independent accounting firm (the 
Accounting Firm
) for arbitration any and all matters that remain in dispute and were properly included in the Notice of Disagreement. The Accounting Firm shall be Deloitte & Touche LLP or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other nationally recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon by the parties hereto in writing. Weyerhaeuser and Spinco shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a decision resolving the matters submitted to the Accounting Firm within 30 days of receipt of the submission. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be enforced. The cost of any arbitration (including the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and reasonable attorney fees and expenses of the parties) pursuant to this Section 2.04 shall be equally shared by Spinco and Weyerhaeuser. Other than the fees and expenses referred to in the immediately preceding sentence, the fees and disbursements of Weyerhaeusers independent auditors shall be borne by Weyerhaeuser and the fees and disbursements of Spincos independent auditors shall be borne by Spinco.

Adjustment Payment.
If the Closing Working Capital is less than $500,000,000, Weyerhaeuser shall, within ten business days after the Statement becomes final and binding on the parties, pay to Spinco the amount by which Closing Working Capital is less than $500,000,000. If the Closing Working Capital exceeds $600,000,000, Spinco shall, within 10 Business Days after the Statement becomes final and binding on the parties, pay to Weyerhaeuser the amount by which Closing Working Capital exceeds $600,000,000. Any payment made pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated in writing at least two business days prior to such payment by the party entitled to receive such payment together with interest thereon at a rate of interest per annum equal to the rate of interest from time to time announced publicly by JPMorgan Chase Bank as its prime rate, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed divided by 365, from the Closing Date to the date of payment.

Working Capital.
The term 
Working Capital
 means Current Assets minus Current Liabilities. The terms 
Current Assets
 and 
Current Liabilities
 mean the current assets and current liabilities, respectively, of the portion of the Newco Business, calculated in the same way, using the same methods, policies, principles and methodologies, as the line items on the Interim Newco Balance Sheet, subject to adjustment in accordance with the Working Capital Principles. Closing Working Capital shall include the Shared Payment Amount. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Closing Working Capital is to be calculated (i) using the methods, policies, principles and methodologies set forth on Schedule 2.04(d), whether or not doing so is in accordance with (A) the methods used for calculating Working Capital on the Interim Newco Balance Sheet or (B) GAAP, (ii) if Schedule 2.04(d) does not set forth relevant methods, policies, principles and methodologies, the Closing Working Capital is to be calculated in the same way, using the same methods, policies, principles and methodologies, as were used by Weyerhaeuser in preparation of the Interim Newco Balance Sheet, whether or not doing so is in accordance with GAAP, and (iii) if no relevant methods, policies, principles and methodologies are available pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the Closing Working Capital is to be calculated in accordance with GAAP applied in a manner consistent with Weyerhaeusers historic methods, policies, principles and methodologies excluding any effects of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The foregoing principles are referred to in this Agreement as the 
Working Capital Principles
. Closing Working Capital is to be calculated as of close of business on the day prior to the Closing Date in accordance with the Working Capital Principles. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm as provided in Section 2.04(b) shall be solely limited to whether such calculation was done in accordance with the Working Capital Principles, and whether there were mathematical errors in the Statement. Under no circumstances shall the Accounting Firm be authorized or permitted to make any other determination or adjustment based on GAAP if Working Capital Principles can be determined pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) of the definition thereof. For purposes of this Section 2.04(d), any items on or omissions from the Interim Newco Balance Sheet that are based upon errors of fact or mathematical errors or that are not in accordance with GAAP shall be retained for purposes of calculating Closing Working Capital. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Accounting Firm is not authorized or permitted to make any determination as to the accuracy of any representation or warranty in this Agreement or as to compliance by Weyerhaeuser with any of its covenants in this Agreement (other than in this Section 2.04).

Following the Closing Date, neither Spinco nor Weyerhaeuser shall take any actions with respect to the accounting books and records of the Business on which the Statement is to be based that would affect the Statement. During the period of time from and after the Closing Date through the resolution of any payment contemplated by Section 2.04(c) or 2.04(f), each of Spinco and Weyerhaeuser shall afford to each other and their respective accountants and counsel in connection with any actions contemplated by this Section 2.04 reasonable access during normal business hours to all the properties, books, contracts, personnel and records of such party relevant to the Statement, the Notice of Disagreement and any payments contemplated by this Section 2.04.
 
(f)
  
Shared Payment Amount.
On the day that Weyerhaeuser delivers to Spinco the Statement in accordance with Section 2.04(a), Weyerhaeuser shall pay to Spinco an amount equal to (1)(A) the sum of the amount of Shared Accounts Receivable and the amount of Shared Inventory, in each case as reflected on the Statement, minus (B) the amount of the Shared Accounts Payable as reflected on the Statement (the amount so calculated, the 
Shared Payment Amount
), plus (2) an amount (the 
Pulp Inventory Adjustment Amount
) equal to 100% of the sum of (A) the LIFO reserve applicable to the Shared Inventory reflected on the Statement (the 
LIFO Reserve Amount
) and (B) an amount equal to 5% multiplied by the sum of the Shared Inventory, as reflected in the Statement, and the LIFO Reserve Amount. On the day that the Statement becomes final in accordance with Section 2.04(b), (i) if the Statement (as revised in accordance with Section 2.04(b)) reflects an increase in the Shared Payment Amount or the Pulp Inventory Adjustment Amount, Weyerhaeuser shall pay to Spinco the amount of such increase, and (ii) if the Statement (as revised in accordance with Section 2.04(b)) reflects a decrease in the Shared Payment Amount or the Pulp Inventory Adjustment Amount, Spinco shall pay to Weyerhaeuser the amount of such decrease. Any payment made pursuant to this Section 2.04(f) shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated in writing at least two Business Days prior to such payment by the party entitled to receive such payment together. The payment pursuant to this Section 2.04(f) shall be independent of whether a payment is due pursuant to Section 2.04(c). Immediately following the Effective Time, (i) Newco shall transfer and assign to Weyerhaeuser the Shared Inventory and the Shared Accounts Receivable, and (ii) Weyerhaeuser shall assume from Newco the Shared Accounts Receivable. At such time, Newco and Spinco shall have no further rights with respect to the Shared Accounts Receivable and the Shared Inventory (which will become Excluded Assets) and shall have no further obligations with respect to the Shared Accounts Payable (which will become Retained Liabilities) other than the right to receive the payments provided for in this Section 2.04(f). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Transaction Documents, Weyerhaeuser shall at any time control the collection of the Shared Accounts Receivables and the sale of the Shared Inventory and Newco and Spinco shall have no rights to dispute at any time any actions or omissions by Weyerhaeuser in connection therewith.

SECTION 4.06
  
Indemnification Procedures.
 
(a)
Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Third Party Claims.
If any party (the 
Indemnified Party
) receives written notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding or the assertion of any claim by a third party or the imposition of any penalty or assessment for which indemnity may be sought under Section 4.02, 4.03, 4.04 or 4.05 (a 
Third Party Claim
), and such Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity pursuant to this Article IV, the Indemnified Party shall promptly provide the other party (the 
Indemnifying Party
) with written notice of such Third Party Claim, stating the nature, basis and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along with copies of the relevant documents evidencing such Third Party Claim and the basis for indemnification sought. Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on account of this indemnification, except if and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party will have 30 days from receipt of any such notice of a Third Party Claim to give notice to assume the defense thereof. If notice to the effect set forth in the immediately preceding sentence is given by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party will have the right to assume the defense of the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice;
provided
,
however
, that such counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party;
provided
,
further
,
however
, that in the event the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim it shall actively pursue such defense in good faith. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within 30 days of receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party against which such Third Party Claim has been asserted will have the right to assume the defense thereof, at its sole cost and expense, upon delivery of notice to such effect to the Indemnifying Party;
provided
,
however
, that if the Indemnifying Party at any time thereafter agrees to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of the Indemnified Partys counsel incurred prior to the time of the Indemnifying Partys assumption of such defense. So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance herewith, (i) the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnified Party will not file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party and (iii) the Indemnifying Party will not (A) admit to any wrongdoing or (B) consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim to the extent such judgment or settlement provides for (x) relief other than money damages or (y) money damages if the Indemnifying Party has not acknowledged in writing that it shall be responsible for such money damages, in each case, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The parties will use their reasonable best efforts to minimize Losses from Third Party Claims and will act in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with such claims. The parties will also cooperate in any such defense and give each other reasonable access to all information relevant thereto. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense, such Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement entered into or any judgment that was consented to without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent.

(b)
  
Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims.
The Indemnified Party will notify the Indemnifying Party in writing promptly of its discovery of any matter that does not involve a Third Party Claim giving rise to the claim of indemnity pursuant hereto. The failure so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on account of this indemnification, except only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party will have 30 days from receipt of any such notice to give notice of dispute of the claim to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation will include providing reasonable access to and copies of information, records and documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such matters.

SECTION 4.08
  
Calculation of Indemnity Payments.
The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Article IV shall be net of any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies or underground storage tank reimbursement programs, with respect to such Loss and shall be (a) increased to take account of any net Tax cost actually incurred by the Indemnified Party arising from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder (grossed up for such increase) and (b) reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such indemnified amount. In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax benefit, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any indemnified amount. For purposes of indemnification under Sections 4.02 and 4.04, the amount of any Loss shall be reduced to the extent of any related current liability in the Statement (as fully resolved).

SECTION 4.09
  
Additional Matters.

Site Separation Requirements.
The parties acknowledge and agree that the Newco Business includes only portions of the operations conducted at the Weyerhaeuser facilities located in Plymouth, North Carolina; Kamloops, British Columbia and Columbus, Mississippi. Weyerhaeuser will use reasonable best efforts to (i) secure any Governmental Approvals required for separation of these operations from the other operations conducted at these facilities as set forth on Schedule 6.05, subject to such modifications as may be required or requested by Governmental Entities, and (ii) accomplish the subdivision, in accordance with the Governmental Approvals, so as to be able to convey the fee interests in such subdivided portions to Newco. In addition, with respect to each such portion, the subdivision of which shall have been accomplished by the Contribution Date, to the extent that Schedule 6.05 provides for easements and/or operating agreements to be entered into in connection with the separation of the operations described in this Section 6.05, Weyerhaeuser or the applicable member(s) of the Weyerhaeuser Group and Newco will execute and deliver such agreements on the Contribution Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that Weyerhaeuser has not accomplished the subdivision required for the conveyance of fee interests in the applicable portions of one or more of these facilities to Newco on the Contribution Date, (a) Weyerhaeuser or the applicable member(s) of the Weyerhaeuser Group and Newco, on the Contribution Date, will enter into interim net leases, under the terms set forth in Schedule 6.05, leasing to Newco the applicable portions of each of such facilities for which the subdivision has not been accomplished by the Contribution Date, pending the obtaining of such Governmental Approvals, it being the parties intent that the conveyance of the fee interest of the premises demised under each of such leases to Newco (with such modifications as may be required by the Governmental Entities in granting such Governmental Approvals) shall occur promptly after the accomplishment of the applicable subdivision, and (b) to the extent that Schedule 6.05 provides for easements and/or operating agreements to be entered into in connection with the separation of the operations at such facilities, Weyerhaeuser or the applicable member(s) of the Weyerhaeuser Group and Newco shall, in lieu of causing such agreements to be executed and delivered on the Contribution Date, arrange for the easements and/or services to be provided to Newco on an interim basis under the Transition Services Agreement or otherwise pending conveyance of fee interests in the premises demised under such leases to Newco, until the conveyance of such fee interests.

If any material is withheld by a party pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, such party shall inform the other party as to the general nature of what is being withheld. Weyerhaeuser may redact such portions of any books and records (including any Records and Transferred Records) that do not relate to the Newco Assets, the Newco Canada Exchangeco Assets, the Newco Liabilities, the Newco Canada Exchangeco Liabilities or the Newco Business.
