Weyerhaeuser Company Announces Expiration of the Early Tender Period for the Maximum Tender Offer
Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:WY) announced the expiration of the early tender period for its Maximum Tender Offers. According to the information provided by Global Bondholder Services Corporation, the depositary for the tender offers, $834,655,000 in aggregate principal amount of the notes were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Maximum Tender Offers at or before 5:00 p.m. New York City time, on May 22, 2007 ("the Early Tender Date"). The consideration to be paid pursuant to the Maximum Tender Offers will be determined at 2:00 p.m. New York City time, on June 4, 2007.
Federal Way, WA  May 23, 2007
Under the terms and conditions specified in the Offer to Purchase dated May 9, 2007, the maximum principal amount to be accepted in the Maximum Tender Offers and Any and All Offers (which expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 16, 2007) will be $825,000,000. The maximum principal amount to be accepted by Weyerhaeuser pursuant to the Maximum Tender Offers will be $519,483,000. $305,517,000 had previously been validly tendered and accepted for purchase in the Any and All Offers.
The table below sets forth more fully the amount of securities validly tendered and accepted in the tender offers. Because the principal amount of 6.95% Debentures due August 1, 2017 validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or before the early tender date exceeded the Maximum Principal Amount to be accepted, Weyerhaeuser will not purchase any of its 7.375% Debentures due March 15, 2032 in the Maximum Tender Offers. Securities of this class that have been tendered will be returned promptly to the tendering holders. Depending on the number of securities tendered prior to the expiration of the Maximum Tender Offers, Weyerhaeuser may not purchase securities of additional series.
