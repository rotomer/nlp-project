Weyerhaeuser Reports 2nd Quarter Net Earnings of $32 Million, or 15 Cents per Diluted Share, on Sales of $4.3 Billion
(Aug. 3, 2007)  Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE: WY) today reported net earnings of $32 million for the second quarter of 2007, or 15 cents per diluted share, on sales of $4.3 billion.
FEDERAL WAY, Wash.
Second quarter 2007 earnings include the following after-tax items:
Excluding these items, the company earned $104 million, or 48 cents per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2007.
Second quarter 2006 results have been recast to reflect the fine paper business and related assets included in the Domtar transaction as discontinued operations and to apply a new accounting pronouncement to expense planned major maintenance costs as incurred.
For second quarter 2006, Weyerhaeuser net earnings were $298 million, or $1.19 per diluted share, on net sales of $4.9 billion. Second quarter 2006 earnings included the following after-tax items:
In addition, net earnings for second quarter 2006 included a one-time tax benefit of $48 million, or 19 cents per diluted share, related to a change in Texas state income tax law, a reduction in the Canadian federal income tax rate and a deferred tax adjustment related to the Medicare Part D subsidy.
Excluding these items, the company earned $273 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2006.
SUMMARY OF SECOND QUARTER BUSINESS PERFORMANCE
 
"In response to continued challenging market conditions, we managed production and costs throughout the second quarter," said Steven R. Rogel, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Our focus remains on the strategic initiatives we've been implementing to create more value for shareholders. In the coming quarter, we will look for ways to further reduce costs and improve performance as we face challenges produced by the continuing sluggish housing market. Meeting these challenges will require tough decisions and the focus of every employee."
SUMMARY OF SECOND QUARTER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
SEGMENT RESULTS FOR SECOND QUARTER
(Contributions to Pre-Tax Earnings)
TIMBERLANDS
Seasonal increases in road and silviculture costs, and a lower level of non-strategic timberland transactions, contributed to the decrease in earnings from the first quarter. In addition, the segment changed its method of accounting for oil and gas revenues and revenues associated with leasing the company's timberlands. The effect of this change was an $11 million decrease in second quarter earnings. Price and volume movements did not have a significant effect on the change from first quarter.
2Q 2007 Performance 
Weyerhaeuser expects non-strategic timberland transactions to be higher in the third quarter compared with second quarter. The continued weakness in the housing market is expected to result in lower volumes and prices.
3Q 2007 Outlook 
WOOD PRODUCTS
Excluding the items noted below, the segment's net loss decreased $38 million from the first quarter, but still reflects difficult market conditions.
2Q 2007 Performance 
 
Weak demand in housing continued to affect segment results. Average prices realized for lumber, plywood, and oriented strand board increased slightly from the first quarter, partially offset by decreased prices for engineered lumber. Sales volumes for lumber and engineered wood products increased, but plywood and oriented strand board volumes declined. The strengthening Canadian dollar had an unfavorable effect on the earnings contribution from products manufactured in Canada.
The company expects the segment to operate at a smaller loss in third quarter compared with the second quarter due primarily to higher prices for oriented strand board, and cost decreases for logs and overhead. Prices for softwood lumber and engineered wood products are expected to decrease. The company expects shipment volumes for lumber and engineered wood products to remain close to second quarter levels. Shipment volumes for oriented strand board are projected to decrease based on anticipated mill operating postures.
3Q 2007 Outlook 
CELLULOSE FIBERS
Market conditions continued to improve. Pulp shipment volumes were down in the second quarter due to the first quarter completion of the Domtar transaction. Maintenance costs declined and overall productivity improved as the segment completed annual maintenance outages at two mills in the second quarter, compared to three mill maintenance outages in the first quarter.
2Q 2007 Performance 
Weyerhaeuser expects stronger prices to result in increased earnings from the segment in third quarter. The company has less annual maintenance scheduled.
3Q 2007 Outlook 
CONTAINERBOARD, PACKAGING AND RECYCLING
 The second quarter included a pre-tax gain of $29 million on the sale of a previously closed box plant site in California and $5 million in charges related to a fire and subsequent closure of the Closter, N.J. box plant. Excluding these items, segment earnings increased $21 million compared to first quarter.
2Q 2007 Performance
Average packaging price realizations increased mainly due to product mix. Containerboard export prices were higher than first quarter. Increased packaging shipments and lower energy costs were partially offset by increased costs for old corrugated containers (OCC) and annual scheduled maintenance downtime at the containerboard mills.
 Weyerhaeuser expects third quarter earnings for the segment to increase from second quarter levels. The company expects to benefit from higher packaging shipment volume, fewer scheduled maintenance outages and lower seasonal energy costs. OCC costs are expected to be higher.
3Q 2007 Outlook
 
REAL ESTATE AND RELATED ASSETS
Single-family home closings increased slightly over the first quarter; however, average sales prices and margins continued to decline due to the weak housing market. Second quarter earnings included a gain of $42 million on the sale of an apartment project and charges of $12 million for asset impairments. The backlog of homes sold, but not closed, remained approximately five months.
2Q 2007 Performance 
Weyerhaeuser expects third quarter earnings from this segment to be lower than the second quarter. Margins continue to decline due to difficult market conditions. The company does not anticipate any significant gains from non-homebuilding activities in the third quarter.
