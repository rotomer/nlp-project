ITEM 7.01. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE
On September 7, 2007, Weyerhaeuser Company announced that market conditions for wood products have not improved in the third quarter. The ongoing weak market conditions will likely result in further actions by the company to balance supply with demand through closures, curtailments and restricted operating postures at the company's Wood Products facilities.
The company said that markets for its Cellulose Fibers and Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling segments continue to improve.
