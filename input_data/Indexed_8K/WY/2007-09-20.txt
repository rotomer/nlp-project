     (f) If, during such period after the first date of the public offering of the Securities as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) of the Securities Act) is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or dealer, any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) of the Securities Act) is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to the dealers (whose names and addresses you will furnish to the Company) to which Securities may have been sold by you on behalf of the Underwriters and to any other dealers upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Prospectus so that the statements in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) of the Securities Act) is delivered to a purchaser, be
 
misleading or so that the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with applicable law.
     (g) To endeavor to qualify the Securities for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as you shall reasonably request.
     (h) To make generally available to the Company's security holders and to you as soon as practicable an earning statement covering a period of at least twelve months beginning with the first fiscal quarter of the Company occurring after the date of this Agreement which shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.

     (j) During the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing through and including the Closing Date, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of the Company substantially similar to the Securities without the prior written consent of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC.
     (k) To prepare and to provide to the Underwriters, as promptly as practicable after the time that the final terms of the Securities and the offering thereof have been established, a final term sheet relating to the offering of the Securities, containing only information that describes the final terms of the Securities or the offering in a form consented to by you, and to file such final term sheet within the period required by Rule 433(d)(5)(ii) under the Securities Act.
     7. . Each Underwriter severally covenants with the Company not to take any action that would result in the Company being required to file with the Commission under Rule 433(d) a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of such Underwriter that otherwise would not be required to be filed by the Company thereunder, but for the action of the Underwriter.
Covenants of the Underwriters
     8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any "road show" as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act that is a free writing prospectus, any "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any "issuer information" as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use therein.
Indemnity and Contribution
     (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each
 
person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing.
     (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity has been or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
indemnified party
indemnifying party
     (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion
 
as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth in such table. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
     (e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
     (f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
     9. . The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters on the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been
Termination
 
suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Global Market, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets, currency exchange rates or controls or any calamity or crisis that, in the judgment of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus.
     10. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
     If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 11 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, in the Time of Sale Prospectus and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
provided
     If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all
 
out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
     11. . The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters named in this Agreement are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, no such Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company. The Company waives to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Underwriters arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Securities.
Absence of Fiduciary Relationship
     12. . This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
Counterparts
     13. . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York.

This Note is a Global Security within the meaning of the Indenture hereinafter referred to and is registered in the name of a Depositary or a nominee thereof. This Note is exchangeable for Notes registered in the name of a person other than the Depositary or its nominee only in the limited circumstances described in the Indenture and, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for individual Notes represented hereby, this Global Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
     
Unless this Note is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation ("DTC"), to the Issuer (as defined below) or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any Note issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), any transfer, pledge or other use hereof for value or otherwise by or to any person is wrongful inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.

     WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY, a Washington corporation (the "Issuer", which term includes any successor thereto under the Indenture referred to below), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assigns, at the office or agency of the Issuer maintained for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, the principal sum of Four Hundred and Fifty Million Dollars ($450,000,000) on September 24, 2009, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, and to pay interest on said principal sum at said office or agency, quarterly in arrears on March 24, June 24, September 24 and December 24 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing December 24, 2007, and at final maturity, in like coin or currency, at a per annum rate equal to LIBOR (determined in the manner described below) plus 1.00% from the Interest Payment Date next preceding the date of this Note to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, unless the date hereof is a date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, in which case from the date of this Note, or unless no interest has been paid or duly provided for on these Notes, in which case from September 24, 2007, until payment of said principal sum has been made or duly provided for; provided that, if this Note is not a Global Security, payment of interest will be made against presentation of this Note at the office or agency of the Issuer maintained for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York (and the offices or agencies of the Issuer maintained for such purpose in any such other locations, if any, as the Issuer may from time to time elect) or, at the option of the Issuer, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear on the Security register; and provided, further, that if this Note is a Global Security registered in the name of a Depositary or its nominee, payment of interest shall be made to the Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, in accordance with the Depositary's procedures as in effect from time to time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the date hereof is after a Regular Record Date (as defined below) and before the following Interest Payment Date, this Note shall bear interest from such Interest Payment Date; provided, that if the Issuer shall default in the payment of interest due on such Interest Payment Date, then this Note shall bear interest from the next preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly
 
provided for on these Notes, from September 24, 2007. The interest so payable on any Interest Payment Date will, subject to certain exceptions provided in the Indenture referred to below, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on the 15th calendar day (whether or not a Floating Rate Business Day, as defined below) immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date (a "Regular Record Date"); provided that interest payable on the final maturity date of this Note will be paid to the Person to whom the principal hereof is paid. If any Interest Payment Date, other than an Interest Payment Date falling on the final maturity date of this Note, would otherwise be a day that is not a Floating Rate Business Day, that Interest Payment Date will be moved to, and will be, the next succeeding Floating Rate Business Day, except that, if that next succeeding Floating Rate Business Day falls in the next succeeding calendar month, that Interest Payment Date instead will be moved to, and will be, the immediately preceding Floating Rate Business Day. If the final maturity date of this Note falls on a day that is not a Floating Rate Business Day, then payments of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Note that are due on the final maturity date need not be made on the final maturity date, but may be made on the next succeeding Floating Rate Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the final maturity date and no interest will accrue for the period after the final maturity date.
     Interest on this Note will accrue from, and including, September 24, 2007 to, but excluding, the Interest Payment Date falling in December 2007 and then from, and including, the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for on this Note to, but excluding, the next Interest Payment Date or the final maturity date, as the case may be; provided that interest shall cease to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes repurchased by the Issuer pursuant to a Change of Control Offer (as defined below) on the dates, and subject to the terms and conditions, set forth below under "Offer to Purchase Upon Change of Control Triggering Event". Interest on this Note will be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the applicable period divided by 360.
     "Floating Rate Business Day" means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in The City of New York; provided, that such day must also be a London Business Day. "London Business Day" means any day on which dealings in deposits in United States dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
     The interest rate on the Notes for the initial Interest Period (as defined below) commencing September 24, 2007 will be set, and for each subsequent Interest Period will be reset, as of the first day of such Interest Period (the date on which that interest rate is set for the initial Interest Period or reset for any subsequent Interest Period is referred to as an "Interest Reset Date"). The interest rate in effect on any day that is not an Interest Reset Date will be the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date (as defined below) pertaining to the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date, and the interest rate in effect on any day that is an Interest Reset Date will be the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date pertaining to that Interest Reset Date.
     "Interest Period" means the period beginning on, and including, an Interest Payment Date to, but excluding, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date or the final maturity date, as the case may be, and the first Interest Period will be the period beginning on, and including, September 24, 2007 to, but excluding, the Interest Payment Date falling in December 2007.
     "Interest Determination Date" means, with respect to any Interest Reset Date, the second London Business Day preceding that Interest Reset Date.
     The Calculation Agent (as defined below) will determine LIBOR in accordance with the following provisions:
 
     "LIBOR" means:
     (1) With respect to any Interest Determination Date, LIBOR will be the rate for deposits in United States dollars having a maturity of three months commencing on the first day of the applicable Interest Period, as such rate is displayed on Reuters page LIBOR01 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service or any successor service for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for United States dollars) ("Reuters Page LIBOR01") as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on that Interest Determination Date. If no rate is displayed as aforesaid, LIBOR with respect to that Interest Determination Date will be determined in accordance with the provisions described in (2) below.
     (2) With respect to an Interest Determination Date on which no rate is displayed on Reuters Page LIBOR01 as specified in (1) above, the Calculation Agent shall request the principal London offices of each of four major banks in the London interbank market (the "reference banks"), selected by the Calculation Agent after consultation with the Issuer, to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in United States dollars for the period of three months, commencing on the first day of the applicable Interest Period, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time, on that Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount of at least $1,000,000 that is representative for a single transaction in United States dollars in that market at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, then LIBOR on that Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations as calculated by the Calculation Agent. If fewer than two quotations are provided by the reference banks, then LIBOR on that Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean as calculated by the Calculation Agent of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on that Interest Determination Date by three major banks in The City of New York, selected by the Calculation Agent after consultation with the Issuer, for loans in United States dollars to leading European banks having a three month maturity and in a principal amount equal to at least $1,000,000 that is representative for a single transaction in United States dollars in that market at that time; provided, however, that if the banks selected by the Calculation Agent are not providing quotations in the manner described in this sentence, LIBOR determined as of that Interest Determination Date shall be LIBOR as in effect on that Interest Determination Date.
     The interest rate on this Note will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.
     All percentages resulting from any calculation on the Notes will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five-one millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards. All dollar amounts used in or resulting from any calculation on the Notes will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upwards.
     In connection with the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer has entered into a Calculation Agent Agreement dated as of September 24, 2007 (as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time and including any successor agreement thereto, the "Calculation Agreement") with The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as calculation agent (herein called the "Calculation Agent", which term includes any successor thereto under the Calculation Agreement). All calculations made by the Calculation Agent for the purposes of calculating interest on the Notes shall be conclusive and binding on the Holders and on the Issuer, absent manifest error. The Issuer covenants and agrees that, so long as any Note remains Outstanding (as defined in the Indenture referred to below), there shall at all times be a Calculation Agent for the purpose of the Notes. In the event of the Calculation Agent being unable or unwilling to continue to act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes or in the case of the Calculation Agent failing duly to establish the rate of interest on the Notes for any Interest Period, the Issuer shall appoint another bank of recognized standing in the United States as Calculation Agent. The Issuer may not remove the Calculation Agent without a successor having been
 
appointed as aforesaid. The Calculation Agent shall determine the interest rate on the Notes as of each Interest Determination Date.
     This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Issuer issued under and pursuant to an Indenture dated as of April 1, 1986 (the "Original Indenture"), as amended and supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of February 15, 1991 (the "First Supplemental Indenture"), a Second Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of February 1, 1993 (the "Second Supplemental Indenture"), a Third Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of October 22, 2001 (the "Third Supplemental Indenture"), and a Fourth Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of March 12, 2002 (the "Fourth Supplemental Indenture"; the Original Indenture, as amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, the Second Supplemental Indenture, the Third Supplemental Indenture, the Fourth Supplemental Indenture and any other indentures supplemental thereto, is hereinafter called the "Indenture"), between the Issuer and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture) to JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank and Chemical Bank), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Issuer and the Holders of the Securities. The Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest (if any) at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions (if any), may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds (if any) and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Security is one of the series of Securities designated on the face hereof (the "Notes").
     The Notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the Issuer at any time prior to the final maturity date.
     In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof and accrued and unpaid interest hereon may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
     The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Issuer and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected (voting as one class), evidenced as in the Indenture provided, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each such series; , that no such supplemental indenture shall, among other things, (i) extend the final maturity of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of any interest thereon, or reduce any amount payable on the redemption thereof, or make the principal thereof or the interest thereon payable in any coin or currency other than that provided in the Securities or in accordance with the terms thereof, or impair or affect the rights of any Holder to institute suit for the payment thereof, without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities the Holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected. It is also provided in the Indenture that, with respect to certain defaults or Events of Default, prior to any declaration accelerating the maturity of the Securities of any series, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series (or, in the case of certain defaults or Events of Default, all or certain series of the Securities) may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series (or all or certain series of the Securities, as the case may be) waive any such past default or Event of Default and its consequences. The preceding sentence shall not, however, apply to a default or Event of Default in respect of the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities or a default or Event of Default in respect of a covenant or provision of the Indenture which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and
provided
 
owners of this Note and any Notes which may be issued in exchange or substitution herefor or on registration of transfer hereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Note or such other Notes.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Note in the manner, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.
     The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. Notes may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations upon surrender of the Notes to be exchanged at the agency of the Issuer maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith.
     The Notes are not subject to any sinking fund.
     Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note at the agency of the Issuer maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor, subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith.
     The Issuer, the Trustee and any authorized agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon), for the purpose of receiving payment of, or on account of, the principal hereof and premium, if any, and, subject to the provisions of the first paragraph hereof, interest hereon and for all other purposes, and neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any authorized agent of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
     No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Issuer in the Indenture or in any Note, or because of any indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, of the Issuer or of any successor entity, either directly or through the Issuer or any successor entity, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof.
     This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, except as may otherwise be required by mandatory provisions of law.
     Terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Indenture.
     The Indenture contains provisions whereby the Issuer may be discharged from its obligations with respect to the Notes, subject to exceptions, if the Issuer deposits with the Trustee cash or U.S. Government Obligations in the amount and in the manner, and satisfies certain other conditions, as in the Indenture provided.
     This Note shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been signed by or on behalf of the Trustee under the Indenture by manual signature of an authorized signatory of the Trustee.
 
Offer to Purchase Upon Change of Control Triggering Event
     If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, the Issuer will make an offer (the "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder of Notes to repurchase (at such Holder's option) all or any part (in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Notes on the terms described below. In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes (or portions thereof) repurchased to, but excluding, the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment"); provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, payments of interest on the Notes that are due and payable on any Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to such a date of repurchase (other than an Interest Payment Date falling on the final maturity date of the Notes) will be payable to the Holders of those Notes registered as such at the close of business on the relevant record dates in accordance with their terms and the terms of the Indenture. Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will mail (or cause to be mailed) a notice (the "Change of Control Purchase Notice") to all Holders of Notes (with a copy to the Trustee) describing the transaction or transactions constituting the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in such notice, which date will be a business day no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days after the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date").
     Holders electing to have a Note or portion thereof repurchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender the Note (which, in the case of Notes in book entry form, may be by book entry transfer) to the Trustee (or to such other agent as may be appointed by the Issuer for such purpose) at the address specified in the applicable Change of Control Purchase Notice prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the applicable Change of Control Payment Date and to comply with other procedures set forth in such Change of Control Purchase Notice. As used in the preceding sentence and in the last sentence of the preceding paragraph, the term "business day" means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in The City of New York.
     On any Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:
Interest on Notes and portions of Notes duly tendered for repurchase pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue on and after the applicable Change of Control Payment Date, unless the Issuer shall have failed to accept such Notes and such portions of Notes for payment, failed to deposit the total Change of Control Payment in respect thereof or failed to deliver the Officers' Certificate, all as required by, and in accordance with, the immediately preceding sentence.
     The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions of
 
the Notes, the Issuer shall comply with those securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes by virtue of such conflict.
     The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Issuer and the third party purchases all Notes properly tendered under its offer and delivers the repurchased Notes or causes the repurchased Notes to be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation on the applicable Change of Control Payment Date. In addition, the Issuer will not repurchase any Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer if there has occurred and is continuing on the applicable Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture (other than an Event of Default resulting from the Issuer's failure to comply with any of the provisions of the Notes or the Indenture relating to such Change of Control Offer or the repurchase of Notes pursuant thereto, including, without limitation, any default in payment of the Change of Control Payment), including Events of Default arising with respect to other series of Securities outstanding under the Indenture.
     The foregoing Change of Control provisions of the Notes shall cease to be applicable (and any failure of the Issuer to comply therewith shall not constitute an Event of Default) if (i) the Indenture shall have ceased to be of further effect with respect to the Notes pursuant to Section 10.1(A) of the Indenture ("satisfaction and discharge"), or (ii) the Issuer shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness on all of the Notes pursuant to Section 10.1(B) of the Indenture ("defeasance") (it being understood that, in addition to the other conditions to defeasance set forth in the Indenture, any such defeasance shall not be effective until the 121st day after the date of deposit referred to in subparagraph (a) of Section 10.1(B) of the Indenture), and, in the case of both clause (i) and (ii) of this sentence, the Issuer shall have satisfied the conditions set forth in the Indenture to such satisfaction and discharge or such defeasance, as the case may be, and (without limitation to the foregoing) shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (each of which comply with Section 11.5 of the Indenture) each to the effect that all conditions precedent to such satisfaction and discharge or defeasance, as the case may be, provided for in the Indenture have been complied with.
     For purposes of the provisions set forth under this caption "Offer to Purchase Upon Change of Control Triggering Event," the following terms have the respective meanings specified below:
     "Capital Stock" means, with respect to any Person, any and all shares, interests, participations or other equivalents (however designated) in the equity of such Person (including, without limitation, (i) with respect to a corporation, common stock, preferred stock and any other capital stock, (ii) with respect to a partnership, partnership interests (whether general or limited), and (iii) with respect to a limited liability company, limited liability company interests).
     "Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (a) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) resulting in any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries) becoming the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Issuer's outstanding Voting Stock or other Voting Stock into which the Issuer's Voting Stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; (b) the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to one or more Persons (other than the Issuer or any of it subsidiaries); or (c) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Issuer's board of directors are not Continuing Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed to be a Change of Control if (1) the Issuer becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (2)(y) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Issuer's Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (z) immediately following that transaction no "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3)
 
of the Exchange Act), other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence, is the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the outstanding Voting Stock of such holding company, measured by voting power rather than number of shares. As used in this paragraph, the term "subsidiary" means, with respect to any Person (the "Parent"), any other Person at least a majority of whose outstanding Voting Stock, measured by voting power rather than number of shares, is owned, directly or indirectly, at the date of determination by the Parent and/or one or more other subsidiaries of the Parent.
     "Change of Control Triggering Event" means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Rating Event.
     "Continuing Directors" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Issuer's board of directors who (a) was a member of the Issuer's board of directors on the date the Notes were originally issued or (b) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to the Issuer's board of directors with the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors who were members of the Issuer's board of directors at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of the Issuer's proxy statement in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination). If at any time the Issuer is not a corporation, then references in the foregoing sentence to members of its board of directors shall be deemed to include, as applicable, the members of any other governing body thereof performing a similar function.
     "Exchange Act" means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor thereto.
     "Investment Grade Rating" means a rating equal to or higher than Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody's and BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P, and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any replacement Rating Agency or Rating Agencies selected by the Issuer.
     "Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
     "Rating Agencies" means (a) each of Moody's and S&P; and (b) if either of Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Notes or fails to make a rating of the Notes publicly available for reasons outside of the Issuer's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act) selected by the Issuer (as certified by a Board Resolution delivered to the Trustee) as a replacement for Moody's or S&P, or both of them, as the case may be.
     "Rating Event" means the rating on the Notes is lowered by each of the Rating Agencies and the Notes are rated below an Investment Grade Rating by each of the Rating Agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by either of the Rating Agencies) after the earlier of (a) the occurrence of a Change of Control and (b) public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control or the Issuer's intention to effect a Change of Control; provided, however, that a Rating Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating will not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus will not be deemed a Rating Event for purposes of the definition of "Change of Control Triggering Event") if each Rating Agency making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply does not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Issuer's request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control has occurred at the time of the Rating Event).
     "S&P" means Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
     "Voting Stock" means, with respect to any specified "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date, any Capital Stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote
 
generally in the election of the board of directors of such person or, if such person is not a corporation, any governing body thereof performing a similar function.
     As used under this caption "Offer to Purchase Upon Change of Control Triggering Event," all references to sections of the Exchange Act and to rules and regulations under the Exchange Act shall include any successor provisions thereto.
     The Company will promptly pay, or will cause the Trustee (if the Trustee is acting as paying agent for the Notes) or another duly appointed paying agent for the Notes to promptly pay (by application of funds deposited by the Company), to each Holder of Notes (or portions thereof) duly tendered and accepted for payment by the Company pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Company will cause the Trustee to promptly authenticate and mail (or deliver by book entry transfer, as applicable) to each such Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion, if any, of the Notes surrendered by such Holder; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Company shall, or shall cause the Trustee to, promptly mail (or cause to be delivered by book entry transfer, as applicable) to the Holders thereof any Notes not so accepted for payment by the Company.
     For purposes of clarity, the Company confirms that (1) the provisions set forth under this caption "Offer to Purchase Upon Change of Control Triggering Event" constitute a covenant of the Company under the Indenture in respect of, and for the benefit of the Holders of, the Notes, (2) for purposes of Section 5.1(d), Section 5.10, Section 8.2 and any other applicable sections of the Indenture, the Notes shall be deemed to be the only series of Securities affected by such covenant or by any default in the performance, or breach, of such covenant or any default or Event of Default resulting therefrom or by any change therein or amendment thereto or waiver thereof, (3) such covenant shall constitute a "right of repayment at the option of the Securityholder" for purposes of Section 8.2 of the Indenture and, without limitation to the foregoing, no supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Article Eight of the Indenture shall reduce the amount payable in respect of, or extend the time for payment of, any Notes pursuant to such covenant without the consent of the Holder of each Note so affected and (4) any failure by the Company to pay all or any part of the Change of Control Payment as and when required pursuant to such covenant shall constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes under Section 5.1(b) of the Indenture.
