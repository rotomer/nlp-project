Pursuant to a Purchase Agreement dated as of [], 2008 (the Purchase Agreement), Seller will sell to Buyer certain assets and certain equity interests for the purchase price and the assumption of certain liabilities;
 
Seller produces residual chips at the _____________ sawmill and plywood mill complex owned by Seller (Sawmill).
 
Buyer utilizes Chips (hereinafter defined) and Fiber Fuel (hereinafter defined) in the manufacturing of pulp and paper products at the pulp and paper mill (the Paper Mill) set forth on Annex A hereto.
 
Seller undertakes and agrees to produce, sell, and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer undertakes and agrees to purchase and/or accept from Seller, those certain quantities of residual softwood chips (herein called Chips) and those certain quantities of bark/wood fuel or hog fuel (hereinafter Fiber Fuel) as are more particularly set forth below.  Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings given such terms in the Purchase Agreement.
 
The parties therefore agree as follows:
 
1.               Unless sooner terminated as provided in paragraph 17, the Term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and extend for fifteen (15) years, ending on the Ending Date.

2.               The Chips shall be of such species and quality as are set forth below.
SCOPE OF WORK- CHIPS
:
 
(a)           .  The acceptable species will be set forth in the specifications described in EXHIBIT A.  All other species shall be considered as non-acceptable.
Acceptable Species
 
(b)           .  Seller, recognizing that Buyer seeks the highest level of Chip quality possible, agrees that:
Chip Production
 
 
 
 
(i)           Sellers chipping and screening equipment will be maintained and operated in a good and workmanlike manner, and that
 
(ii)          Seller will use reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that Chips will be free from contamination such as char, rocks, tramp metal, plastic or other extraneous matter.
 
(c)           .  Seller agrees that all Chips, except plywood Chips or Chips produced from wood that has been stored at a wet yard, sold hereunder shall be produced from green wood that has not been previously kiln or air-dried and such Chips will be delivered to Buyer containing only their natural moisture content.
Moisture Content
 
(d)           .  Chips must conform to the current specifications that apply for the Paper Mill (the Chip Specifications) as described in EXHIBIT A.  The Chip Specifications will identify a range of acceptable size and thickness for individual Chips, and shall not materially differ from the specifications in place for the Paper Mill during the 2007 calendar year.  In addition, the Chip Specifications will specify the requirements to determine whether a load meets minimum requirements of acceptability.
Chip Specifications
 
(e)           .  Buyer may propose to modify Chip Specifications upon sixty (60) days advance written notice to Seller.  Buyer shall not modify the specifications to set higher standards for Seller than for any other suppliers of comparable products to the applicable delivery points.

2
 
(ii)           To accept, with Sellers consent, such non-conforming chips as fuel chips, and compensate Seller at the then current market price Buyer pays for such fuel chips.
 
Buyers rejection of non-conforming Chips may be either (i) by refusing to allow the Chips to be unloaded at Buyers Paper Mill; or (ii) if the non-conformity was not apparent to Buyer until after unloading, by Buyers subsequent notice and claim against Seller, provided that Buyer shall only reject Chips within a reasonable time after the Chips are unloaded at Buyers delivery point (not to exceed twenty-four (24) hours after delivery) and only if such Chips are non-conforming due to contamination.  In the event Buyer rejects any or all Chips not meeting Buyers specifications, Buyer may reload, or cause to be reloaded the rejected Chips onto trucks or rail cars, and the Chips shall be returned to Sellers Sawmill or to such other place as reasonably instructed by Seller, provided, however, that the disposition of any rejected Chips shall be at Sellers sole cost, risk and expense.

DEFAULT; LIMITATION OF DAMAGES
 
(a)           A party shall be in default under this Agreement if such party fails to comply with its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect after written notice thereof (i) within a period of fifteen (15) days after such notice if compliance is commercially practicable within fifteen (15) days, or (ii) within a reasonable period after such written notice if compliance is not commercially practicable within fifteen (15) days and such party begins to comply within fifteen (15) days.
 
(b)           In the event of a default in payment for delivered Chips or Fiber Fuel, Sellers remedy shall be limited to the unpaid contract price, together with such incidental damages, if any, as allowed by section 2-710 of the Uniform Commercial Code; provided, however, that (i) in the event Buyer fails to make any weekly payment when due hereunder and shall not have cured such failure within one (1) week of notice of such failure, Seller may, during the continuation of any such failure, suspend deliveries of Chips or Fiber Fuel hereunder and (ii) if Buyer continues not to cure such failure within two (2) weeks of Sellers suspension of deliveries, pursuant to subsection (i) herein, Seller may terminate this Contract by written notice to Buyer.

(c)           Except as otherwise set forth herein, in the event of any default other than as set out in paragraph 5(b) above, the non-defaulting partys damages shall be limited to the difference between the market or cover price and the unpaid contract price for the Chips or Fiber Fuel as to which the other party is in default.
 
(d)           Seller acknowledges and agrees that Buyer would be damaged irreparably in the event Seller failed to perform in particular under paragraphs 4 (Volumes) and paragraph 10 (Certification) of this Contract and such nonperformance remained uncured after the time period set forth in paragraph 5(a).  Accordingly, Seller agrees that Buyer shall be entitled to enforce specifically such provisions of this Contract that provide for continued delivery of Chips under the terms of the Contract in any action instituted in any court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the parties and the matter, in addition to any other remedy to which Buyer may be entitled at law or in equity, including incidental and consequential damages.

the Chips to Buyers carrier at the Sawmill.  Seller agrees to make Chips available for loading at such times during normal business hours as designated by Buyer and communicated to Seller.  Seller is responsible for loading the Chips and shall bear all costs and risks associated therewith.  Title to and risk of loss of the Chips shall pass from Seller to Buyer upon the Chips being loaded onto Buyers carrier at the Sawmill, except that title to and risk of loss of any non-conforming chips that are rejected shall revert to the Seller immediately upon rejection.  When Seller is loading the Chips pursuant to this Agreement, Seller agrees to furnish, to the extent necessary for loading, a sufficient number of capable personnel and safe and operationally sound loading equipment, provided that Buyers carrier shall use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with Sellers customary loading practice. Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Buyers carrier is available at the Sawmill to accept deliveries of Chips at those times designated by Buyer and communicated to Seller and at such other times communicated by Seller to Buyer as
[Seller shall deliver
may be necessary, in Sellers reasonable judgment, to avoid the excessive accumulation of Chips based on the storage capacity of the Chip handling equipment, the Chip bins and available ground storage at the Sawmill. The Buyer shall not be responsible for chip handling, loading or storage costs for chips stockpiled for any reason in normal storage locations near the Sawmill, including chip bins and available ground storage, on  pads or otherwise. Buyer shall be responsible for and shall bear all costs associated with making Chip transportation arrangements, ensuring that Buyers carrier is available at the Sawmill to accept deliveries of Chips and transport Chips from the Sawmill.  If, through no fault of Seller, Buyers carrier is not available at the designated times to accept deliveries of Chips, and in Sellers reasonable determination, such unavailability of transportation has the potential to adversely impact Sellers operations, Seller shall provide Buyer with not less than twenty-four (24) hours written notice of such potential adverse impact.  If after such notice to Buyer, Seller reasonably determines that it is still exposed to a potential adverse impact because of the unavailability of Buyers transportation carrier and that it must arrange for transportation of Chips to Buyers Paper Mill in order to avoid or mitigate the potential adverse impact, it shall be entitled to do so.  In such case, Buyer will be responsible to Seller for the commercially reasonable transportation expenses incurred by Seller.  If the non availability of Buyers transportation carrier results in a reduction of production, or the incurrence of extraordinary costs, at the Sawmill, Buyer shall be responsible for commercially reasonable expenses incurred by Seller to make up for the reduced production or such costs.  Buyer and Seller shall mutually agree upon the terms for delivery, transportation and unloading of any Fiber Fuel purchased pursuant to this Agreement. ]
 
Form of Paragraph 8 for Western Mills (Albany and Springfield):
 
[Seller agrees to deliver the Chips during normal business hours, or at such other times as mutually agreed to between Buyer and Seller.  Transportation of the Chips from Sellers Sawmill to Buyers Paper Mill may be by truck or rail, as determined by the operational capability and demands of Sellers Sawmill and Buyers Paper Mill, and as mutually agreed to between Buyer and Seller.  Seller shall be responsible for the cost of truck transportation and is responsible for loading the Chips and/or Fiber Fuel, whether on to trucks or rail, and shall bear all costs and risks associated therewith.  Buyer is responsible for provision of sufficient railcars and the cost of rail transportation.  If shipment of the Chips is by rail, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to properly load the railcars to maximize the total allowable carload weight prescribed by the railroad(s) participating in the movement of Chips to Buyers Paper Mill. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for truck delivered Chips, title to and risk of loss of the Chips shall pass from Seller to Buyer upon the Chips being unloaded at Buyers Paper Mill.  Title to and risk of loss of any non-conforming chips that are rejected shall revert to the Seller immediately upon rejection.  Buyer may request that Seller deliver Chips to mills other than the Paper Mill (Other Paper Mills).  Seller will deliver Chips to Other Paper Mills and Buyer agrees to provide supplemental truck transportation, if needed.  In addition, the delivered price for Chips will be adjusted according to the freight matrix in Schedule 3 to account for differences in freight cost between Buyers Paper Mill and Other Paper Mills.  Buyer and Seller shall mutually agree upon the term for delivery, transportation and unloading of any Fiber Fuel purchased pursuant to this Agreement]

9.              All Chips and Fiber Fuel delivered by truck shall be weighed by Buyer, or its designee, which data shall be recorded by the weigher on scale or weight tickets and a copy of each ticket shall be given or transmitted to Seller or Sellers designated representative.  Each load of Chips or Fiber Fuel must be identified by giving the weigher at the specified delivery point the authorization card which includes the Purchase Order information.  Additional information required by the parties or by state laws shall also be included on the scale ticket.  Manual scale tickets may be used according to the procedures agreed to by the parties.  If scales for weighing railcars are not operational at Buyers Paper Mill, Buyer and Seller shall mutually agree upon an acceptable method for estimating railcar weights.  If a federal or state entity provides written notice to Buyer of a deficiency with respect to Buyers weighing process, Buyer shall provide Seller with written notice of such deficiency within seven (7) days of receipt of the notice from such federal or state entity.  At the Paper Mills located in Oregon, green ton weight shall be converted to bone dry ton weight using an agreed upon process for sampling frequency and conversion calculation.
WEIGHING

10.             Seller shall conduct harvesting activities for its wholly-owned wood fiber in accordance with applicable state best management practices (BMPs) for water quality protection in forestry in a manner that meets the minimum requirement of SFI, or such other third-party certification program as is mutually approved in writing from time to time by Buyer and Seller.  Seller shall use logging professionals trained in accordance with the applicable SFI SIC standards, and shall endeavor to work with its third-party wood suppliers to seek independent certification of their woodlands to an appropriate program such as the American Tree Farm system.  Compliance with this paragraph shall be evidenced in all respects by a certificate verifying compliance with the agreed-upon certification system, including its wood sourcing provisions.
CERTIFICATION

11.             Each party shall, throughout the term of this Agreement, carry appropriate insurance with a reputable insurance company covering property damage, business interruptions, workers compensation, employers liability and general liability insurance (including contractual liability) to protect its own business and property interests, provided that each party may self-insure in accordance with applicable industry standards.

12.             Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller and its assignees, subcontractors, members, shareholders, directors, officers, managers, partners, employees, agents and consultants (collectively, Seller Indemnitee), from and against all claims and causes of action, pending or threatened, of any kind, by third parties, related to or arising out of any bodily injury to, or death of, any person, or any physical damage to tangible property, to the extent that such injury or damage results from the negligent or intentionally wrongful act or omission of Buyer; except to the extent such injury or damage also results in part from the negligent or intentionally wrongful act or omission of any Seller Indemnitee.

Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer and its assignees, subcontractors, members, shareholders, directors, officers, managers, partners, employees, agents and consultants (collectively, Buyer Indemnitee), from and against all claims and causes of action, pending or threatened, of any kind, by third parties, related to or arising out of any bodily injury to, or death of, any person, or any physical damage to tangible property, to the extent that such injury or damage results from the negligent or intentionally wrongful act or omission of Seller; except to the extent such injury or damage also results in part from the negligent or intentionally wrongful act or omission of any Buyer Indemnitee.
 
In the event either party is entitled to be indemnified by the other, at the indemnitees request, the indemnitor shall afford a complete defense of any such claim, demand, cause of action or suit and shall bear all attorneys fees, costs of preparation and maintenance of the defense, all court costs and expert, discovery and investigative fees, and any associated appeal costs, to the end that the indemnitee shall incur no cost whatsoever as a result of such claim, demand, cause of action or suit, or ensuring compliance with this indemnity provision.  The indemnitee expressly reserves the right to be represented by counsel of its own selection, at indemnitors expense.  The exercise of indemnitees right to select its own attorneys will in no way detract from or release indemnitor from its obligation to indemnify and hold seller harmless hereunder.

(i)Within fifteen (15) days following the appointment of the panel, each party will submit to the panel the price that such party desires to apply to the Products involved and any materials such party wishes to submit supporting the use of the proposed fair market price.  This documentation shall be kept confidential by the panel with respect to any third party.
   
 
(ii)         Within fifteen (15) days following the submission of the prices by each party, the panel will choose between the two submitted prices based upon the panels determination of the price that better reflects the actual fair market price for the subject Products.  If only one proposed price is submitted, the panel will choose such price.
 
(iii)        The panel will deliver the decision in writing to each of the parties within three (3) days following the date of its determination and shall assess the costs of the arbitration and reasonable attorney fees against the party whose prices was not chosen or who did not submit a price.
(d)          Other than as set forth in paragraph 30(c), each party shall bear its own cost of presenting its case, and each party shall bear one-half of the cost incurred by the panel, the mediation, or an alternative dispute resolution procedure, as the case may be.
(e)           Except as otherwise described in paragraph 5 or actions brought to enforce an arbitral award or the provisions of this paragraph 30, the dispute resolution process set out herein shall be the sole mechanism for dispute resolution.
