Exhibit 3.2 Amended and Restated Bylaws
The principal office of this corporation, and its registered office in the State of Washington, is the Weyerhaeuser Headquarters Building, 33663 Weyerhaeuser Way South, Federal Way, Washington.
The registered agent of the corporation is the Secretary of the corporation.
1. (a) The annual meeting of shareholders at which the Directors are elected shall be held at 9:00 a.m. on the third Thursday in April at the registered office of the corporation, or at such other time or place within or without the State of Washington as may be designated by the Board of Directors, for the purpose of electing directors, and for the transaction only of such other business as is properly brought before the meeting, in accordance with these bylaws.
     (b) To be properly brought before the meeting, business must be of a nature that is appropriate for consideration at an annual meeting and must be (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a shareholder. In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before the annual meeting by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation. To be timely, each such notice must be given, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the corporation, not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that less than 100 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever first occurs. Each such notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (w) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (x) the name and address of record of the shareholder proposing such business, (y) the class or series and number of shares of the corporation which are owned by the shareholder, and (z) any material interest of the shareholder in such business.
     (c) Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be transacted at the annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall be deemed to preclude discussion
 
by any shareholder of any business properly brought before the annual meeting, in accordance with these bylaws.
2. Special meetings of shareholders shall be held at such time and place as shall be stated in the notice of special meeting solely for such purpose or purposes as may be stated in the notice of said meeting. Except as otherwise specifically required by law and subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the common shares as to dividends or upon liquidation, special meetings of shareholders may be called only by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors (as defined in Section 1 of Article III).
3. The record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at each annual or special meeting of shareholders shall be the close of business on the eighth Friday preceding each such meeting, provided, however, that the Board of Directors may by resolution fix a different record date for any particular meeting of shareholders.
4. Every shareholder shall furnish in writing to the principal transfer agent, his post office address at which notice of shareholders' meetings and any other notices or communications pertaining to the corporation's affairs or business may be served upon or mailed to him; and every shareholder shall forthwith advise the principal transfer agent in writing of any change of address.
1. The business and affairs of this corporation shall be managed under the direction of a Board of Directors consisting of not fewer than nine (9) nor more than thirteen (13) directors, the exact number to be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors, each director to hold office until his successor shall have been elected and qualified. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in an election to which plurality voting does not apply, the term of a director who does not receive a majority of the votes cast in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article III, but who was a director at the time of the election, shall terminate on the date that is the earliest of (i) 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results, (ii) the date on which a person is selected by the Board of Directors to fill the office held by such director, which selection shall be deemed to constitute the filling of a vacancy by the Board of Directors, and (iii) the date on which the director's resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors. Whenever used in these bylaws, the phrase "entire Board of Directors" shall mean that number of directors fixed by the most recent resolution adopted pursuant to the preceding sentence prior to the date as of which a determination of the number of directors then constituting the entire Board of Directors shall be relevant for any purpose under these bylaws.
2. Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the common shares as to dividends or upon liquidation, nominations for the election of directors may be made by the Board of Directors or a committee appointed by the Board of Directors or by any shareholder entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. However, any shareholder entitled to vote generally in the election of directors may nominate one or more persons for election as directors at a meeting only if written notice of such shareholder's intent to make such nomination or nominations has been given, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the corporation not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that less than 100 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice by the
 
shareholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever first occurs. Each such notice to the Secretary shall set forth:
     (a) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made:
          (i) the name and address of record of the shareholder who intends to make the nomination, as they appear on the corporation's books and of such beneficial owner, if any,
          (ii) the number of shares of the corporation that are owned beneficially and of record by such shareholder and such beneficial owner, if any, as of the date of such notice (which information shall be supplemented by such shareholder and beneficial owner, if any, not later than 10 days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date),
          (iii) a representation that the shareholder of record and beneficial owner, if any intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice, and
          (iv) any other information relating to such shareholder that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filing required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Exchange Act"); and
     (b) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director:
          (i) the name, age, business and residence addresses, and principal occupation or employment of each nominee,
          (ii) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the shareholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the shareholder,
          (iii) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such shareholder as would be required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and serving as a director of the corporation if so elected, and
          (iv) a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the past three years, and any other material relationships, between or among such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, and their respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the one hand, and each proposed nominee, and his respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the other hand, including without limitation all information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 promulgated under Regulation S-K if the shareholder making the nomination and any beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is made, if any, or any affiliate or associate thereof or person acting in concert therewith, were the
 
"registrant" for purposes of such rule and the nominee were a director or executive officer of such registrant; and
     (c) with respect to each nominee for election or re-election to the Board of Directors, the completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement required by paragraph 3 of this Article III. The corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the corporation or that could be material to a reasonable shareholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee. The presiding officer of the meeting may, if the facts warrant, determine that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedure, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
3. To be eligible to be a nominee for election or reelection as a director of the corporation, a person must deliver (in accordance with the time periods prescribed for delivery of notice under paragraph 2 of this Article III) to the Secretary of the corporation at the principal executive offices of the corporation a written questionnaire with respect to the background and qualification of such person and the background of any other person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made (which questionnaire shall be provided by the Secretary upon written request) and a written representation and agreement (in the form provided by the Secretary upon written request), which agreement shall (a) provide that such person (i) is not and will not become a party to (A) any agreement, arrangement or understanding with, and has not given any commitment or assurance to, any person or entity as to how such person, if elected as a director of the corporation, will act or vote on any issue or question (a "Voting Commitment") that has not been disclosed to the corporation or (B) any Voting Commitment that could limit or interfere with such person's ability to comply, if elected as a director of the corporation, with such person's fiduciary duties under applicable law, (ii) is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity other than the corporation with respect to any direct or indirect compensation, reimbursement or indemnification in connection with service or action as a director that has not been disclosed therein, and (iii) in such person's individual capacity and on behalf of any person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made, would be in compliance, if elected as a director of the corporation, and will comply with all applicable publicly disclosed corporate governance, conflict of interest, confidentiality and stock ownership and trading policies and guidelines of the corporation.
4. A nominee for director shall be elected or re-elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast for such nominee's election or re-election exceed the votes cast against such nominee's election or re-election. Shares otherwise present at the meeting, but for which there is an abstention, as to which no authority or direction to vote in the election is given or specified, or whose ballot is marked withheld shall not be deemed to be votes cast. Notwithstanding the foregoing, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of shareholders for which (i) the Secretary of the corporation has received a notice that a shareholder has nominated a person for election to the Board of Directors in compliance with the advance notice requirements for shareholder nominees for director set forth in the corporation's bylaws and (ii) such nomination has not been withdrawn by such shareholder on or prior to the expiration of the time fixed in such bylaw for submitting nominations (a "contested election"). If the number of nominees for any election of directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast. If directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, shareholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee.
 
5. In the event that there shall be a vacancy on the Board of Directors, a person may be appointed as a director to fill such vacancy by vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors. Any director appointed to fill a vacancy on the Board of Directors shall stand for election by the shareholders at the next annual meeting of shareholders.
6. Meetings of the Board of Directors, regular or special, may be held at any place within or without the State of Washington.

This corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved (including, without limitation, as a witness) in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether formal or informal, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer or employee, or who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise, or employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee") against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses actually incurred by the person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding to the fullest extent and in the manner set forth in and permitted by the Business Corporation Act of the State of Washington, and any other applicable law, as from time to time in effect. Such right of indemnification shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the person may be entitled apart from the foregoing provisions. For purposes of this Article "director, officer or employee" shall include persons who hold such positions in this corporation or in a wholly owned subsidiary, or hold, at the written request of an officer of this corporation, an equivalent position in another enterprise.

The right to indemnification conferred in this section shall be a contract right.
2. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article XII shall include the right to be paid by this corporation the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"). An advancement of expenses shall be made upon delivery to this corporation of a written affirmation of the indemnitee of the indemnitee's good faith belief that the indemnitee has met the standard of conduct described in
 
RCW 23B.08.510 and an undertaking, by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that the indemnitee did not meet the standard of conduct.
3.
