ITEM 2.06. MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS
On June 24, 2008, the company completed a review of a set of real estate projects that resulted in the conclusion that material impairments will be recognized in the second quarter.  Decisions to lower prices or abandon projects in response to continued deterioration in the housing market triggered the impairments.
The company is in the process of completing its quarterly evaluation of real estate and related assets and anticipates that total impairments and land-related charges will be in the range of $300 million to $325 million for the second quarter 2008 on a pre-tax basis. The company expects that none of the impairment charges will result in future cash expenditures.
ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS
The company's Containerboard Packaging and Recycling segment was adversely affected by the extreme weather and flooding in the U.S. Midwest, which caused production shutdowns at company facilities and decreased the company's ability to operate its facilities or ship inventory for a period of time.  The company's containerboard mill in Cedar Rapids, IA has been down for two weeks and is expected to resume operations in early July.
