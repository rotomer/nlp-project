(Oct. 31, 2008)  Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE: WY) today reported net earnings of $280 million for the third quarter of 2008, or $1.33 per diluted share, on net sales of $2.6 billion. This compares with net earnings of $101 million, or 47 cents per diluted share, on sales of $4.1 billion for the same period last year.
FEDERAL WAY, Wash.
SIGNIFICANT THIRD QUARTER 2008 AFTER-TAX ITEMS
Excluding these items, the company reported a net loss of $3 million, or 1 cent per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2008.
SIGNIFICANT THIRD QUARTER 2007 AFTER-TAX ITEMS
Excluding these items, the company earned $118 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2007.
"We expect housing market conditions will remain difficult, and our businesses will continue to aggressively manage costs and inventory accordingly," said Dan Fulton, president and chief executive officer. "As a result of actions we've already taken, we have a strong balance sheet and good liquidity. We're meeting the challenges of today's markets, while preparing for stronger markets in the future."
SUMMARY OF THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
 
Weyerhaeuser reclassified the Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling operations as discontinued due to the Aug. 4 sale of the segment's assets to International Paper. Weyerhaeuser's Australian operations were also reclassified as discontinued due to the sale of these assets in July. The net sales and revenues of these operations are included in net sales from discontinued operations for the third quarters of both 2008 and 2007.
SEGMENT RESULTS FOR THIRD QUARTER (Contributions to Pre-Tax Earnings)
Effective July 2008, Weyerhaeuser's international operations outside of North America are reported as part of the Timberlands segment. These operations, which consist primarily of timberlands and related converting operations in South America, were previously reported as part of the Corporate and Other segment.
TIMBERLANDS
Third quarter earnings improved slightly from second quarter, primarily due to higher oil and gas revenues and an increase in sales of non-strategic timberlands. These improvements were partially offset by lower domestic log prices and a seasonal decline in fee harvest volumes. Segment earnings include losses related to international operations of approximately $6 million in the third quarter and $5 million in the second quarter.
3Q 2008 Performance 
Weyerhaeuser expects fourth quarter earnings from the Timberlands segment to be lower than third quarter. Fee harvest volumes are expected to be lower due to the weak domestic market.
4Q 2008 Outlook 
WOOD PRODUCTS
Excluding the pre-tax items noted below, the segment's loss was $12 million less in the third quarter.
3Q 2008 Performance 
Average price realizations for lumber, oriented strand board and engineered lumber products improved, and manufacturing and selling, general and administrative costs declined. These improvements were largely offset by lower shipment volumes for all of the segment's primary
 
products, as U.S. single-family housing starts fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 602,000 for the third quarter.
Weyerhaeuser expects challenging housing market conditions to continue into the fourth quarter. We anticipate operating losses to worsen as prices and volumes decline in the seasonally slower fourth quarter.
4Q 2008 Outlook 
CELLULOSE FIBERS
Fewer annual maintenance outages resulted in lower maintenance costs and improved productivity. Average pulp price realizations increased. These benefits were partially offset by higher chemical and freight costs.
3Q 2008 Performance 
Fourth quarter earnings for the segment are expected to be slightly lower than third quarter. Weyerhaeuser anticipates lower pulp prices, partially offset by benefits from a weakening Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.
4Q 2008 Outlook 
CONTAINERBOARD, PACKAGING AND RECYCLING
Weyerhaeuser sold its Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling operations to International Paper on Aug. 4. Third quarter results reflect the segment's operations for the month of July.
3Q 2008 Performance 
REAL ESTATE
Excluding the pre-tax items noted below, the segment's loss was $6 million in the third quarter compared to a loss of $25 million in the second quarter.
3Q 2008 Performance 
The loss from homebuilding operations was slightly lower in the third quarter due to the mix of homes closed and lower selling expenses. Homebuilding operations closed on sales of 720 units, a 17 percent decrease from the second quarter, reflecting continued weak housing demand. The backlog of homes sold, but not closed, was less than four months.
Weyerhaeuser expects fourth quarter home sale closings to be comparable to third quarter, but anticipates lower average sales price realizations. Excluding impairments and lot and acreage sales, the segment's loss from homebuilding operations is expected to increase in the fourth quarter due to continuing weakness in the housing market.
4Q 2008 Outlook 
 
CORPORATE AND OTHER
Third quarter results for the Corporate and Other segment include the following pre-tax items:
