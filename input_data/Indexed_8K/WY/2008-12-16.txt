In addition, Substitute Awards shall not reduce the shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the Plan.  The number of shares available for issuance under the Plan shall not be reduced to reflect any dividends or dividend equivalents that are reinvested into additional shares or credited as additional Restricted Stock, Stock Units, Performance Shares or Performance Units.  All shares issued under the Plan shall be authorized and unissued shares.
 
(b)           The Committee shall have the authority to grant Awards as an alternative to or as the form of payment for grants or rights earned or due under other compensation plans or arrangements of the Company.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company becomes subject to new accounting rules applicable to equity-based compensation, and is required to or elects to expense the cost of Options pursuant to FAS 123 (or a successor or other standard), the Committee shall have the sole discretion to substitute, without receiving Participant permission, SARs paid only in stock for outstanding Options; provided, the terms of the substituted stock SARs are the same as the terms for the Options, the number of shares underlying the number of stock SARs equals the number of shares underlying the Options and the difference between the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares and the Grant Price of the SARs is equivalent to the difference between the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares and the Option Price of the Options.
 
7.6           Post-Termination Exercise
The Committee shall establish and set forth in each instrument that evidences an Option whether the Option shall continue to be exercisable, and the terms and conditions of such exercise, after a Termination of Service, any of which provisions may be waived or modified by the Committee at any time.
 
7.7           Incentive Stock Options
The terms of any Incentive Stock Options shall comply in all respects with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code, or any successor provision, and any regulations promulgated thereunder.  Individuals who are not employees of the Company or one of its parent or subsidiary corporations (as such terms are defined for purposes of Section 422 of the Code) may not be granted Incentive Stock Options.  To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of Common Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year exceeds $100,000 or, if different, the maximum limitation in effect at the time of grant under the Code (the Fair Market Value being determined as of the Grant Date for the Option), such portion in excess of $100,000 shall be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options.

8.1           Grant of Stock Appreciation Rights
The Committee may grant stock appreciation rights (Stock Appreciation Rights or SARs) to Participants at any time.  A SAR may be granted in tandem with an Option or alone (freestanding).  The grant price of a tandem SAR shall be equal to the exercise price of the related Option, and the grant price of a freestanding SAR shall be equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock for the Grant.  A SAR may be exercised upon such terms and conditions and for the term as the Committee determines in its sole discretion; provided, however, that, subject to earlier termination in accordance with the terms of the Plan and the instrument evidencing the SAR, the term of a freestanding SAR shall be as established for that SAR by the Committee or, if not so established, shall be 10 years, and in the case of a tandem SAR, (a) the term shall not exceed the term of the related Option and (b) the tandem SAR may be exercised for all or part of the shares subject to the related Option upon the surrender of the right to exercise the equivalent portion of the related Option, except that the tandem SAR may be exercised only with respect to the shares for which its related Option is then exercisable.
 
8.2           Payment of SAR Amount
Upon the exercise of a SAR, a Participant shall be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying: (a) the difference between the market price at which the shares of Common Stock are trading on the New York Stock Exchange as of the time of exercise over the grant price by (b) the number of shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised.  At the discretion of the Committee, the payment upon exercise of a SAR may be in cash, in shares of equivalent value, in some combination thereof or in any other manner approved by the Committee in its sole discretion.
 
 
9.1           Grant of Restricted Stock and Stock Units
The Committee may grant Restricted Stock and Stock Units on such terms and conditions and subject to such repurchase or forfeiture restrictions, if any (which may be based on continuous service with the Company or a Related Company or the achievement of any of the Performance Criteria set forth in Section 11.1), as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion, which terms, conditions and restrictions shall be set forth in the instrument evidencing the Award.
 
9.2           Issuance of Shares
Upon the satisfaction of any terms, conditions and restrictions prescribed with respect to Restricted Stock or Stock Units, or upon a Participants release from any terms, conditions and restrictions of Restricted Stock or Stock Units, as determined by the Committee, and subject to the provisions of Section 13, (a) the shares of Restricted Stock covered by each Award of Restricted Stock shall become freely transferable by the Participant, and (b) Stock Units shall be paid in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion.  Any fractional shares subject to such Awards shall be paid to the Participant in cash.
 
9.3           Dividends and Distributions
Participants holding shares of Restricted Stock or Stock Units may, if the Committee so determines, be credited with dividends paid with respect to the underlying shares or dividend equivalents while they are so held in a manner determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.  The Committee may apply any restrictions to the dividends or dividend equivalents that the Committee deems appropriate.  The Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine the form of payment of dividends or dividend equivalents, including cash, shares of Common Stock, Restricted Stock or Stock Units.
 
 
10.1           Grant of Performance Shares
The Committee may grant Awards of performance shares (Performance Shares) and designate the Participants to whom Performance Shares are to be awarded and determine the number of Performance Shares, the length of the performance period and the other terms and conditions of each such Award.  Each Award of Performance Shares shall, upon the attainment of performance goals and other terms and conditions specified by the Committee, entitle the Participant to a payment in the form established by the Committee.  The form of payment may be in cash, shares of Common Stock, Options, Share Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock or other awards or any combination of cash, shares of Common Stock, Share Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock or other awards.  Notwithstanding satisfaction of any performance goals, the number of shares of Common Stock issued under an Award of Performance Shares may be adjusted on the basis of such further consideration as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion.  However, the Committee may not, in any event, increase the number of shares of Common Stock earned upon satisfaction of any performance goal by any Covered Employee.
 
10.2           Grant of Performance Units
The Committee may grant Awards of performance units (Performance Units) and designate the Participants to whom Performance Units are to be awarded and determine the number of Performance Units and the terms and conditions of each such Award.  Performance Units shall entitle the Participant to a payment in cash upon the attainment of performance goals and other terms and conditions specified by the Committee.  Notwithstanding the satisfaction of any performance goals, the amount to be paid under an Award of Performance Units may be adjusted on the basis of such further consideration as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion.  However, the Committee may not, in any event, increase the amount earned under Awards of Performance Units upon satisfaction of any performance goal by any Covered Employee, and the maximum amount earned by such Covered Employee in any calendar year may not exceed $5,000,000.  The Committee, in its discretion, may substitute actual shares of Common Stock for the cash payment otherwise required to be made to a Participant pursuant to a Performance Unit.

11.1           Awards Subject to Performance Goals
Awards of Restricted Stock, Stock Units, Performance Shares, Performance Units and other Awards made pursuant to the Plan may be made subject to the attainment of performance goals relating to one or more of the following business criteria within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code: profits (including, but not limited to, profit growth, net operating profit or economic profit); profit-related return ratios; return measures (including, but not limited to, return on assets, capital, equity or sales); cash flow (including, but not limited to, operating cash flow, free cash flow or cash flow return on capital); earnings (including, but not limited to, earnings growth, net earnings, earnings per share, or earnings before or after taxes); net sales growth; net income (before or after taxes, interest, depreciation and/or amortization); gross or operating margins; productivity ratios; share price (including, but not limited to, growth measures and total shareholder return); expense targets; margins; cost reduction; cash value added; operating efficiency; customer satisfaction; and working capital targets (Performance Criteria).  Performance Criteria may be stated in absolute terms or relative to comparison companies or indices to be achieved during a period of time.
 
11.2           Use and Calculation of Performance Criteria
Any Performance Criteria may be used to measure the performance of the Company as a whole or any business unit of the Company.  Any Performance Criteria may include or exclude Non-recurring Items.  Performance Criteria shall be calculated in accordance with (a) the Companys financial statements or generally accepted accounting principles, or (b) under a methodology established by the Committee prior to the issuance of an Award that is consistently applied and identified in the audited financial statements, including footnotes, or the Managements Discussion and Analysis section of the Companys annual report.  The Committee may not in any event increase the amount of compensation payable to a Covered Employee upon the satisfaction of any Performance Criteria.
 
In addition to the Awards described in Sections 7 through 10, and subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee may grant other incentives payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock under the Plan as it determines to be in the best interests of the Company and subject to such other terms and conditions as it deems appropriate; provided, however, that the maximum amount that any Participant shall be eligible to receive in any one calendar year shall be $5,000,000.
 
(a)           The Company may require the Participant to pay to the Company the amount of (i) any taxes that the Company is required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign law to withhold with respect to the grant, vesting or exercise of an Award (tax withholding obligations) and (ii) any amounts due from the Participant to the Company or to any Related Company (other obligations).  The Company shall not be required to issue any shares of Common Stock under the Plan until such tax withholding obligations and other obligations are satisfied.
 
(b)           The Committee may permit or require a Participant to satisfy all or part of his or her tax withholding obligations and other obligations by (i) paying cash to the Company, (ii) having the Company withhold an amount from any cash amounts otherwise due or to become due from the Company to the Participant, (iii) having the Company withhold a number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued to the Participant (or become vested in the case of Restricted Stock) having a Fair Market Value equal to the tax withholding obligations and other obligations (up to the employers minimum required tax withholding rate if such a limitation is necessary to avoid a charge to the Company for financial reporting purposes), or (iv) surrendering a number of shares of Common Stock the Participant already owns having a value equal to the tax withholding obligations and other obligations (up to the employers minimum required tax withholding rate to the extent the Participant has owned the surrendered shares for less that six months if such a limitation is necessary to avoid a charge to the Company for financial reporting purposes).
 
No Award or interest in an Award may be sold, assigned, pledged (as collateral for a loan or as security for the performance of an obligation or for any other purpose) or transferred by the Participant or made subject to attachment or similar proceedings otherwise than by will or by the applicable laws of descent and distribution, except that to the extent permitted by the Committee, in its sole discretion, a Participant may designate one or more beneficiaries on a Company-approved form who may receive payment under an Award after the Participants death.  During a Participants lifetime, an Award may be exercised only by the Participant.
 
 
15.1           Amendment, Suspension or Termination of the Plan
The Board or the Compensation Committee of the Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or any portion of the Plan at any time and in such respects as it shall deem advisable; provided, however, that, to the extent required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule, shareholder approval shall be required for any amendment to the Plan.
 
15.2           Term of the Plan
Unless sooner terminated as provided herein, the Plan shall terminate on April 13, 2013.  After the Plan is terminated, no future Awards may be granted, but Awards previously granted shall remain outstanding in accordance with their applicable terms and conditions and the Plans terms and conditions.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Incentive Stock Options may be granted more than 10 years after April 13, 2004.
 
15.3           Consent of Participant
The amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan or a portion thereof or the amendment of an outstanding Award shall not, without the Participants consent, materially adversely affect any rights under any outstanding Award under the Plan.  Any change or adjustment to an outstanding Incentive Stock Option shall not, without the consent of the Participant, be made in a manner so as to constitute a modification that would cause such Incentive Stock Option to fail to continue to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any adjustments made pursuant to Section 4.1 shall not be subject to these restrictions.
 
- 11 - -
 
 
 
16.1           No Individual Rights
(a)           No individual or Participant shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and the Company has no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants under the Plan.
 
(b)           Nothing in the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed to constitute an employment contract or confer or be deemed to confer on any Participant any right to continue in the employ of, or to continue any other relationship with, the Company or any Related Company or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Related Company to terminate a Participants employment or other relationship at any time, with or without cause.
 
16.2           Issuance of Shares
(a)           Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company shall have no obligation to issue or deliver any shares of Common Stock under the Plan or make any other distribution of benefits under the Plan unless, in the opinion of the Companys counsel, such issuance, delivery or distribution would comply with all applicable laws (including, without limitation, the requirements of the Securities Act or the laws of any state or foreign jurisdiction) and the applicable requirements of any securities exchange or similar entity.
 
(b)           The Company shall be under no obligation to any Participant to register for offering or resale or to qualify for exemption under the Securities Act, or to register or qualify under the laws of any state or foreign jurisdiction, any shares of Common Stock, security or interest in a security paid or issued under, or created by, the Plan, or to continue in effect any such registrations or qualifications if made.  The Company may issue certificates for shares with such legends and subject to such restrictions on transfer and stop-transfer instructions as counsel for the Company deems necessary or desirable for compliance by the Company with federal, state and foreign securities laws.  The Company may also require such other action or agreement by the Participants as may from time to time be necessary to comply with applicable securities laws.
 
(c)           To the extent the Plan or any instrument evidencing an Award provides for issuance of stock certificates to reflect the issuance of shares of Common Stock, the issuance may be effected on a non-certificated basis, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange.
 
16.3           No Rights as a Shareholder
Unless otherwise provided by the Committee or in the instrument evidencing the Award or in a written employment or services agreement, no Option or Award denominated in units shall entitle the Participant to any cash dividend, voting or other right of a shareholder unless and until the date of issuance under the Plan of the shares that are the subject of such Award.
 
16.4           Compliance with Laws and Regulations
(a)           Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may bifurcate the Plan so as to restrict, limit or condition the use of any provision of the Plan to Participants who are officers or directors subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act without so restricting, limiting or conditioning the Plan with respect to other Participants.  Additionally, in interpreting and applying the provisions of the Plan, any Option granted as an Incentive Stock Option pursuant to the Plan shall, to the extent permitted by law, be construed as an incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code.
 
(b)           The Plan and Awards granted under the Plan are intended to be exempt from the requirements of Code Section 409A to the maximum extent possible, whether pursuant to the short-term deferral exception described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), the involuntary separation pay plan exception described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), or otherwise.  To the extent Code Section 409A is applicable to the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan, it is intended that the Plan and any Awards granted under the Plan comply with the deferral, payout and other limitations and restrictions imposed under Code Section 409A.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan to the contrary, the Plan and any Award granted under the Plan shall be interpreted, operated and administered in a manner consistent with such intentions.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan to the contrary, with respect to any payments and benefits under the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan to which Code Section 409A applies, all references in the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan to the termination of the Participant's employment or service are intended to mean the Participant's "separation from service," within the meaning of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i).  In addition, if the Participant is a "specified employee," within the meaning of Code Section 409, then to the extent necessary to avoid subjecting the Participant to the imposition of any additional tax under Code Section 409A, amounts that would otherwise be payable under the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan during the six-month period immediately following the Participant's "separation from service," within the meaning of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i), shall not be paid to the Participant during such period, but shall instead be accumulated and paid to the Participant (or, in the event of the Participant's death, the Participant's estate) in a lump sum on the first business day after the earlier of the date that is six months following the Participant's separation from service or the Participant's death.
Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan, the Committee, to the extent it deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, reserves the right, but shall not be required, to unilaterally amend or modify the Plan and any Award granted under the Plan so that the Award qualifies for exemption from or complies with Code Section 409A; provided, however, that the Committee makes no representations that Awards granted under the Plan shall be exempt from or comply with Code Section 409A and makes no undertaking to preclude Code Section 409A from applying to Awards granted under the Plan.
 
16.5           Participants in Other Countries
The Committee shall have the authority to adopt such modifications, procedures and subplans as may be necessary or desirable to comply with provisions of the laws of other countries in which the Company or any Related Company may operate to ensure the viability of the benefits from Awards granted to Participants employed in such countries, to comply with applicable foreign laws and to meet the objectives of the Plan.
 
16.6           No Trust or Fund
The Plan is intended to constitute an unfunded plan.  Nothing contained herein shall require the Company to segregate any monies or other property, or shares of Common Stock, or to create any trusts, or to make any special deposits for any immediate or deferred amounts payable to any Participant, and no Participant shall have any rights that are greater than those of a general unsecured creditor of the Company.
 
- 12 - -
 
 
16.7           Successors
All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Awards shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all the business and/or assets of the Company.
 
16.8           Severability
If any provision of the Plan or any Award is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any person, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or, if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the Committees determination, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Award, and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.
 
16.9           Choice of Law
The Plan, all Awards granted thereunder and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant hereto, to the extent not otherwise governed by the laws of the United States, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law.
 
16.10                      Treatment of Awards Following a Change in Control
(a)           Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan to the contrary, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, unless otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Award or in a written employment or other agreement between the Participant and the Company, or specifically prohibited under applicable laws, or by the rules and regulations of any governing governmental agencies or national securities exchanges:
(i)           Any and all Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall become fully vested and immediately exercisable, and shall remain exercisable throughout their entire term;
(ii)           Any restriction periods and restrictions imposed on Restricted Stock or Stock Unit Awards that are not performance-based shall lapse;
(iii)           The target pay out opportunities attainable under all outstanding Awards that are performance-based shall be deemed to have been fully earned for the entire performance period(s) and  restrictions shall lapse and such Awards shall be immediately settled or distributed;
(iv)           The restrictions and other conditions applicable to any other Stock Unit Awards or any other awards shall lapse, and such other Stock Unit Awards or such other awards shall become free of all restrictions, limitations or conditions and become fully vested and transferable to the full extent of the original grant.
(b)           Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, during the 60-day period from and after a Change in Control (the Exercise Period), if the Committee shall determine at, or at any time after, the time of grant, a Participant holding an Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall have the right, whether or not the Option or Stock Appreciation Right is fully exercisable and in lieu of the payment of the purchase price for the shares of Common Stock being purchased under the Option or Stock Appreciation Right and by giving notices to the Company, to elect (within the Exercise Period) to surrender all or part of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right to the Company and to receive cash, within 30 days of such notice, in an amount equal to the amount by which the Change in Control Price per share on the date of such election shall exceed the purchase price per share of Common Stock under the Option or Stock Appreciation Right (the spread) multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock granted under the Option or Stock Appreciation Right as to which the right granted under this Section 16.10(b) shall have been exercised.
 
(c)           Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, (i) any adjustments made pursuant to this Section 16.10 to Awards that are considered "deferred compensation" within the meaning of Code Section 409A shall be made in compliance with the requirements of Code Section 409A and (ii) any adjustments made pursuant to this Section 16.10 to Awards that are not considered "deferred compensation" subject to Code Section 409A shall be made in such a manner as to ensure that after such adjustment the Awards either (x) continue not to be subject to Code Section 409A or (y) comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A.
 
The Plan is amended and restated effective January 1, 2009 (the Effective Date).
