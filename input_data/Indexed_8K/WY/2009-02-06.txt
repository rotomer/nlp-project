SIGNIFICANT FOURTH
QUARTER 2008 AFTER-TAX ITEMS
Excluding these items, the company reported a net loss of $209 million, or 99 cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
The upheaval in financial markets during fourth quarter was accompanied
by accelerated deterioration of housing markets
. In addition, declining demand in emerging markets adversely affected our Cellulose Fibers operations
.
While
closing the companys books for fourth quarter, management determined these conditions had triggered asset impairments in
some
of the companys business segments.
T
he company recognized estimated goodwill impairment charges of $
827
million
in its Wood Products and Cellulose Fibers segments, and
after-tax asset impairments and other real-estate related
charges of $
31
3 million in its Real Estate
and Corporate and Other segments in
the fourth quarter.
The goodwill impairments are not deductible for income tax purposes.

AFTER-TAX ITEMS
 
 
 
 
 
Excluding these items, the company earned $90 million, or 42 cents per share, in the fourth quarter 2007.
 
These results reflect the speed and severity of the deterioration of market conditions, said Dan Fulton, president and chief executive officer. Were well aware of our near-term challenges and the uncertainty of the timing of the eventual recovery.  We are taking actions to weather this storm and improve our performance.
SUMMARY OF FOURTH
QUARTER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
SUMMARY OF ANNUAL
FIN
ANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
 
Weyerhaeuser
reclassified the Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling operations as discontinued due to the Aug
ust
2008
sale of the segment
s assets to International Paper. Weyerhaeuser
s Au
stralia
n
operations
were also
reclassified as discontinued due to the sale of these assets in July
2008
. The net sales and revenues of these operations are included in net sales from discon
tinued operations for
both
the
fourth quarter
and
full year
of
2007
,
and
for the
full year of 2008.
SEGMENT RESULTS FOR FOURTH
QUARTER
(Contributions to Pre-Tax Earnings)
Effective July 2008, Weyerhaeuser
s international operations outside of North America are reported as part of the Timberlands segment. These operations, which consist
primarily of
 
timberlands and related converting operations in South America, were previously reported as part of th
e Corporate and Other segment.
 
 
 
 
 
TIMBERLANDS
Fourth quarter earnings declined from third quarter, primarily due to lower sales of non-strategic timberlands. Additionally, continued weak domestic markets resulted in reduced fee harvest volumes. Segment earnings include losses related to international operations of $10 million in the fourth quarter and $6 million in the third quarter.
4Q 2008 Performance 
Weyerhaeuser expects first quarter 2009 earnings from the Timberlands segment to be comparable to the fourth quarter, as challenging market conditions persist.
1Q 2009 Outlook 
WOOD PRODUCTS
4Q 2008 Performance 
Excluding the pre-tax items noted below, the segments loss wa
s $77 
million
more
in the fourth quarter.
The increased loss from operations is primarily due to significantly lower prices for lumber and oriented strand board, and reduced sales volumes as a result of the continued decline in the housing market.
Weyerhaeuser expects challenging market conditions to continue into the first quarter. Operating losses in first quarter are expected to be comparable to fourth quarter.
1Q 2009
Outlook 
CELLULOSE FIBERS
4Q 2008
Performance 
Excluding
a f
ourth quart
er charge
of $9
4
million for the impairment of goodwill
,
the segments earnings declined $13 million in the fourth quarter.
Fourth quarter earnings from operations decreased due to lower pulp price realizations, reduced shipment volumes and lower capacity utilization as we slowed production to match declining demand. Shipment volumes were adversely affected by a sudden drop in demand in emerging markets. Weaker pulp prices were partially offset by increased earnings in our liquid packaging and newsprint businesses.
First quarter earnings for the segment are expected to be significantly lower than fourth quarter earnings from operations. Weyerhaeuser anticipates lower pulp prices and increased costs related to annual maintenance. We will continue to manage production to meet declining demand.

Performance
Excluding the pre-tax items noted b
elow, the segments loss was $10 million more than
third quarter.
The already depressed housing market was further affected by
increased financial turmoil
. Job losses, both actual and announced, and
a loss of
consumer confidence reduced the number of potential home buyers.
 
Increasing foreclosures added inventory to the marketplace causing lower appraisal
values
and home sale prices.
In light of
these
deteriorating market conditions
and increased uncertainty regarding the timing of recovery
, the company reviewed its homebuilding projects and land portfolio to determine whether the assets would continue to be held for development or sold. During fourth quarter, management decided to sell some of its land portfolio, which required the company to write the land assets down to current fair value
,
result
ing
in impairments. Impairments
also were recorded
on projects and land held for development.
Homebuilding operations closed 755 units, a 5 percent increase from third quarter
,
reflecting seasonal sales activity
. The average price of home sales closed was slightly lower than the previous quarter.
The backlog of homes sold, but not closed, was
slightly more than two months
.
 
Traffic in our real estate developments
decreased
33
percent
from the both the prior quarter
,
and from
fourth
quarter last year.
1Q 2009 Outlook
 
Weyerhaeuser expects first quarter home closings to be
seasonally lower
than fourth quarter
. We expect the market conditions discussed above to continue.
Excluding imp
airments, and sales of
land and other asset
s,
the segments loss from homebuilding operations is expected to increase
 
in the first quarter
.
CORPORATE AND OTHER
Fourth
quarter results for the Corporate and Other segment include the following pre-tax items
