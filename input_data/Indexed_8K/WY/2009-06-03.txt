These statements are based on various assumptions and may not be accurate because of risks and uncertainties surrounding these assumptions.   Factors listed below, as well as other factors, may cause actual results to differ significantly from these forward-looking statements.  There is no guarantee that any of the events anticipated by these forward-looking statements will occur.  If any of the events occur, there is no guarantee what effect they will have on company operations or financial condition.

In addition, these words may use the positive or negative or other variations of those terms.  
We make forward-looking statements regarding the company's expectations during the second quarter of 2009, including the company's markets, the effect of facility closures and cost control measures in the wood products segment, fee timber harvests and log prices, demand and pricing for our wood products, decreases in raw material costs for our wood products segment, increased expenses for annual planned maintenance in the Cellulose Fiber segment, the effect of potential alternative fuel mixture tax credits, demand and prices for pulp, home sale closings and prices, earnings and performance of our business segments, capital expenditures and the timing of debt repayments. Major risks, uncertainties and assumptions that affect the company's businesses and may cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to:
the effect of general economic conditions, including the level of interest rates, availability of financing for home mortgages, strength of the U.S. dollar, employment rates and housing starts;
market demand for the company's products, which is related to the strength of the various U.S. business segments and economic conditions;
the successful execution of internal performance plans, including restructurings and cost reduction initiatives;
the restructuring of the company's business support functions;
performance of the company's manufacturing operations, including maintenance requirements;
raw material prices;
energy prices;
transportation costs;
performance of pension fund investments and related derivatives;
contributions to pension plans

projected tax rates and IRS audit outcomes;
changes in accounting principles;
the effect of weather;
loss from fires, floods, windstorms, hurricanes, pest infestation and other natural disasters; and
other factors described under "Risk Factors" in the company's annual report on Form 10-K or periodic reports.
The company is a large exporter and is affected by changes in economic activity in Europe and Asia, particularly Japan and China.  It also is affected by changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the relative value of the U.S. dollar to the euro and the Canadian dollar. Restrictions on international trade or tariffs imposed on imports also may affect the company.

Economic Overview  Wood Products
 
Key messages  Wood Products markets
Unprecedented demand drop has driven prices to levels below cash operating costs
Prices should rebound to cover cash operating costs for an average mill
For lumber, need to see prices cover Canadian mill costs
Canadian dollar is a major issue for both the lumber and OSB price outlook
 
Severity compared to earlier cycles
 
All regions curtailed output, but bigger hit for Canada
 
Prices fell below cash cost to force closures
 
Another anomaly: Douglas Fir below Spruce
 
In nominal dollars, prices back to 1982 levels
 
But adjusted for inflation  1935?
 
Canadian lumber delivered costs eventually drive U.S. lumber and log markets  
U.S. lumber production not sufficient to meet U.S. demand
Cost structure in Canada is primarily operating costs, not stumpage
Canadian exchange rate can significantly shift relative cost structure between U.S. and Canadian mills
 
Canada accounts for over 25% of U.S. needs
 
Different cost structure in Canadian lumber industry
In Canada, labor and energy costs account for 75-85% of total lumber costs
Much higher delivered log prices due to harvest and haul costs
Stumpage is formula driven
In U.S., labor and energy costs account for only 40-50% of labor cost
Stumpage prices reflect logistic advantage and species premiums
 
For average mill to breakeven, need $25/mbf price lift

Shift has kept prices below cash operating costs
 
Summary - Wood Products
Another challenging year given housing starts and excess capacity
Prices need to reflect cash operating costs for average mills eventually
Log prices moved sharply lower in late 2008will help U.S. sawmill cost position in 2009
Very challenging for OSB and engineered lumber in 2009-10 given low operating rates

Economic Overview  Timberlands
 
Key messages - Timberlands
Log prices in the West fell over 25% during the last two months
Log prices in the South are also adjusting, but not as severely
Timberland prices remain stable reflecting favorable long-term outlook
 
Log prices lag lumber prices
 
Western production now below early 1990's
 
Southern log prices have held up better
 
Timberland prices reflect long-term outlook
Financial owners taking longer term view
Long-term trend appreciation based on:
Historic returns and expected rebound in housing starts
Decline in Canadian harvest due to Mountain pine beetle
Additional revenue from non-traditional sources
 
Housing demand driven by formation of households
 
Share of single family determined by ownership trend
 
Expect favorable single-family housing starts even if ownership trends lower
 
Given trend demand range for housing  lumber approaches 2005 peak
 
Reason lumber capacity expected to decline by 2015
 
Trend value for U.S. timber driven by Canadian costs
U.S. needs Canadian supply to meet lumber demand
Marginal supply has price setting role
U.S. producers bid improving lumber prices back to log prices
 
U.S. needs Canadian lumber through the cycle

More to timberland valuation story
Finite resource capable of providing multiple values such as land appreciation, timber production and appreciation, and non-timber income
Potential government actions could boost those values
Timberland are part of the asset mix of many diversified portfolios

Log prices fell into line with lumber prices
Timberland prices have been relatively stable
