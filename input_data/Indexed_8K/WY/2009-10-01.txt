Covenants of the Underwriters
 
8.           .  (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any road show as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act that is a free writing prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any issuer information as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use therein.
Indemnity and Contribution
 
14
 
 
(b)           Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing.
 
(c)           In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the ) shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the ) in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and J.P. Morgan, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity has been or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.

(d)           To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth in such table.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
 
(e)           The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
 
(f)           The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
 
16
 
9.           .  The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters on the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Global Market, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets, currency exchange rates or controls or any calamity or crisis that, in the judgment of Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and J.P. Morgan, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in the judgment of Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and J.P. Morgan, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus.
Termination
 
10.           .  This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
 
If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter.  If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, in the Time of Sale Prospectus and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
provided
 
17
 
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
 
11.           .  The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters named in this Agreement are acting solely in the capacity of an arms length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person.  Additionally, no such Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction.  The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.  The Company waives to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Underwriters arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Securities.
Absence of Fiduciary Relationship
 
12.           .  This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
Counterparts
 
13.           .  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York.

In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes (or portions thereof) repurchased to, but excluding, the date of repurchase (the Change of Control Payment); provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, payments of interest on the Notes that are due and payable on any dates falling on or prior to such a date of repurchase will be payable to the Holders of those Notes registered as such at the close of business on the relevant record dates in accordance with their terms and the terms of the Indenture.  Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will mail (or cause to be mailed) a notice (the Change of Control Purchase Notice) to all Holders of Notes (with a copy to the Trustee) describing the transaction or transactions constituting the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in such notice, which date will be a business day no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days after the date such notice is mailed (the Change of Control Payment Date).

Holders electing to have a Note or portion thereof repurchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender the Note (which, in the case of Notes in book-entry  form, may be by book-entry transfer) to the Trustee (or to such other agent as may be appointed by the Issuer for such purpose) at the address specified in the applicable Change of Control Purchase Notice prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the applicable Change of Control Payment Date and to comply with other procedures set forth in such Change of Control Purchase Notice.

The Issuer will promptly pay, or will cause the Trustee (if the Trustee is acting as paying agent for the Notes) or another duly appointed paying agent for the Notes to promptly pay (by application of funds deposited by the Issuer), to each Holder of Notes (or portions thereof) duly tendered and accepted for payment by the Issuer pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Issuer will cause the Trustee to promptly authenticate and mail (or deliver by book entry transfer, as applicable) to each such Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion, if any, of the Notes surrendered by such Holder; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.  The Issuer shall, or shall cause the Trustee to, promptly mail (or cause to be delivered by book entry transfer, as applicable) to the Holders thereof any Notes not so accepted for payment by the Issuer.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event.

(a)           As between Weyerhaeuser and Obligor, Obligor, hereby unconditionally and expressly assumes the due and punctual performance of all payment obligations (the Indebtedness Payment Obligations) of Weyerhaeuser under and in respect of the indebtedness of Weyerhaeuser described on Schedule I attached to this Agreement, including, without limitation, the payment of all principal, interest, any yield maintenance premium or other prepayment charge in respect of such indebtedness, costs of enforcement of the rights of the holders of such indebtedness and other charges, fees and costs arising out of or related to such indebtedness (collectively, the Indebtedness), all to the same extent and with the same effect as if Obligor had originally executed all agreements, instruments and other documents evidencing, arising out of or related to such Indebtedness (collectively, and as amended from time to time, the Loan Documents) and had been named as an additional original obligor therein in respect of the Indebtedness.
 
(b)           Obligor shall satisfy the Indebtedness Payment Obligations by making payments (i) directly to the holders of the Indebtedness (or any trustee acting on behalf of such holders) or (ii) directly to Weyerhaeuser, as instructed by Weyerhaeuser from time to time as reimbursement in the event Weyerhaeuser has been required to make any payments to the holders (or any trustee acting on behalf of such holders).
 
(c)           Obligor acknowledges and agrees that no occurrence or circumstance occurring after the date of this Agreement shall cause a reduction in Obligors obligations to Weyerhaeuser under this Agreement, other than the subsequent payment by Obligor in cash of the Indebtedness.
 
 
 
 
 
Obligors obligations under this Agreement shall in all respects be continuing, absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall remain in full force and effect until all of the Indebtedness has been paid in full.

(c)           any amendment to, rescission, waiver or other modification of, or any consent to departure from, any of the terms of any of the Loan Documents;

(e)           any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a legal or equitable discharge of, Weyerhaeuser or Obligor.
 
 
Notwithstanding the assumption by Obligor of the Indebtedness of Weyerhaeuser pursuant to Section 1(a), as between Weyerhaeuser and the holders of the Indebtedness, Weyerhaeuser shall continue to be the primary obligor with respect to the Indebtedness and Weyerhaeuser shall not be released from its obligations under the Indebtedness as a result of this Agreement.  In no event shall this Agreement be construed to constitute an assignment or transfer of any of the rights or obligations of Weyerhaeuser under the Loan Documents.
 
 
Obligor represents, warrants and affirms for the benefit of the holders of the Indebtedness as follows:
 
(a)           Obligor is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the state of Washington with all requisite power and authority to own and operate its properties, to conduct its business as proposed to be conducted and to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement.

The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.
 
 
 
 
 
(a)           THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES.
