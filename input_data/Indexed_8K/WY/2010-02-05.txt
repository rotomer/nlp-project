SIGNIFICANT FOURTH QUARTER 2009 AFTER-TAX ITEMS
Excluding these items, the company reported a net loss of $109 million, or 52 cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 2009.
SIGNIFICANT FOURTH QUARTER 2008 AFTER-TAX ITEMS
Excluding these items, the company reported a net loss of $209 million, or 99 cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 2008.
The weak housing market continues to present challenges and affect our financial performance, said Dan Fulton, president and chief executive officer. 2009 has been another tough year and our financial results are disappointing. Despite difficult market conditions, we made significant progress this past year to position ourselves to rebuild revenues and earnings. We cut costs, reduced production to meet demand, focused on cash generation, and deferred harvest to preserve the long-term values of our timberlands. With an eye to the future, we made changes across all business lines to improve long-term competitiveness, implemented plans to grow with strategic customers and announced our decision to convert to a REIT. As we enter 2010, markets continue to be challenging, but Im confident were positioned to deliver significantly improved operating performance.
 
 
 
 
SUMMARY OF FOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
SUMMARY OF ANNUAL FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
SEGMENT RESULTS FOR FOURTH QUARTER
Contributions (Charges) to Pre-Tax Earnings
TIMBERLANDS
Excluding the pre-tax items noted below, the segments fourth quarter results decreased $22 million.
4Q 2009 Performance 
Fourth quarter earnings from operations were lower primarily due to the companys decision to defer additional harvest, lower sales of non-strategic timberlands and higher logging, trucking and road costs. These reductions were partially offset by an increase in log sales realizations. Losses related to international operations, excluding the pre-tax items noted above, were $6 million compared to $4 million in third quarter.
Excluding the effect of non-strategic land sales,Weyerhaeuser expects first quarter operating earnings from the segment to be comparable to fourth quarter primarily due to improved log sales realizations offset by higher costs.
1Q 2010 Outlook 
 
WOOD PRODUCTS
 
 
 
 
Excluding the pre-tax items noted below, the segments fourth quarter results decreased $31 million.
4Q 2009 Performance 
The higher operating loss in the fourth quarter was due to lower volumes and lower sales prices in nearly all product lines. The segment took more downtime to match lower seasonal and market demand.
Weyerhaeuser expects a lower operating loss in first quarter due to improved operating rates and anticipated sales realization improvements for lumber and OSB.
1Q 2010 Outlook 
CELLULOSE FIBERS
Excluding the pre-tax items noted below, the segments fourth quarter results decreased $10 million.
4Q 2009 Performance 
An extended annual outage at the New Bern, NC mill contributed to lower production and increased maintenance costs. Fiber and energy costs also increased in the fourth quarter. These cost increases more than offset improved sales realizations for pulp.
Excluding the effect of alternative fuel mixture credits, which ended in 2009,Weyerhaeuser expects earnings from operations for first quarter to be comparable to fourth quarter. Annual maintenance and fiber costs are expected to increase. These costs are expected to offset improved pulp price realizations.
1Q 2010 Outlook 
 
 
REAL ESTATE
Excluding the pre-tax items noted below, the segments fourth quarter results improved $30 million.
4Q 2009 Performance 
The contribution from the segment's operations was $21M in the fourth quarter excluding the losses on land and lot sales. Homebuilding operations closed 778 single-family homes, a 54 percent increase from third quarter. The average price of homes closed increased 7 percent from the previous quarter. Selling expenses increased primarily due to higher volumes.
Excludingasset impairments, restructuring and related charges, Weyerhaeuser expects the segment to be profitable in the first quarter. A loss is expected from single-family homebuilding operations due to seasonally lower closings; however, two commercial partnership interests were sold in January 2010 and will contribute $33 million in earnings.
