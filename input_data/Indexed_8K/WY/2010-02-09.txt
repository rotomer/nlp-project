(Executive) Executive Change in Control Agreement (Tier I)
     THIS EXECUTIVE CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT (Tier I) is made and entered into by and between Weyerhaeuser Company (hereinafter referred to as the "Company") and (hereinafter referred to as the "Executive").
                    
                    
     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has approved the Company entering into change in control agreements with certain key executives of the Company;
     WHEREAS, the Executive is a key executive of the Company;
     WHEREAS, should the possibility of a Change in Control of the Company arise, the Board believes it is imperative that the Company and the Board should be able to rely on the Executive to continue in his position, and that the Company should be able to receive and rely on the Executive's advice, if requested, as to the best interests of the Company and its shareholders without concern that the Executive might be distracted by the personal uncertainties and risks created by the possibility of a Change in Control; and
     WHEREAS, should the possibility of a Change in Control arise, in addition to his regular duties, the Executive may be called upon to assist in the assessment of such possible Change in Control, advise management and the Board as to whether such Change in Control would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and to take such other actions as the Board might determine to be appropriate.
     NOW THEREFORE, to assure the Company that it will have the continued dedication of the Executive and the availability of his advice and counsel notwithstanding the possibility, threat, or occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company, and to induce the Executive to remain in the employ of the Company, and for other good and valuable consideration, the Company and the Executive agree as follows:
Article 1. Term of This Agreement
     Subject to the provisions of Article 10, this Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and shall continue in effect for three (3) full calendar years. However, at any time prior to the end of such three-year (3) period, and at any time prior to the end of any extended term, the Committee may, in its discretion, extend the term of this Agreement for any period of time up to three (3) additional years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement is subject to annual review and may be amended or otherwise modified by the Committee in its sole discretion subsequent to such annual review, provided that no Change in Control shall have occurred.
     However, in the event a Change in Control occurs during the term of this Agreement, this Agreement will remain in effect for the longer of (i) twenty-four (24) full calendar months beyond the month in which such Change in Control occurred or (ii) until all obligations of the Company to the Executive hereunder have been fulfilled, and until all benefits required hereunder have been paid to the Executive.

     In the event the Executive's job classification is reduced below the minimum level required for eligibility to continue to be covered by severance protection as determined at the sole discretion of the Committee, the Committee may remove the Executive from coverage under this Agreement. Such removal shall be effective three (3) months after the date the Company notifies the Executive of such removal.

3.2 Removal From Coverage.
Article 4. Severance Benefits
     The Executive shall be entitled to receive from the Company Severance Benefits if
4.1 Right to Severance Benefits.
Receipt of Severance Benefits shall disqualify the Executive from eligibility to receive any other severance benefits from the Company, including, without limitation, those under any Executive Severance Agreement between the Company and the Executive, as such agreement may be amended, supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time, or, if such agreement is no longer in effect, any successor agreement thereto.

(ii) Termination or lapsing of any restriction periods and restrictions imposed on such Equity Awards that are not performance based;
(iii) Termination or lapsing of any restriction or other conditions applicable to any such Equity Awards and such Equity Awards shall become free of all restrictions, limitations or conditions and become fully vested and transferable to the full extent of the original grant; and
(iv) Recognition of the target payout opportunities attainable under all outstanding Equity Awards that are performance-based, which Equity Awards shall be deemed to have been fully earned for the entire performance periods and restrictions on such Equity Awards shall lapse and such Equity Awards shall be immediately settled or distributed.
     Following a CIC of the Company, if the Executive's employment is terminated due to Disability, no compensation or benefits shall be payable under this Agreement and the Executive shall instead receive his Base Salary through the Effective Date of Termination, at which point in time the Executive's benefits shall be determined in accordance with the Company's disability and other applicable compensation and benefits plans and programs then in effect.
4.4 Termination for Disability.
     Following a CIC of the Company, if the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of his death or voluntary Retirement other than for Good Reason, no compensation or benefits shall be payable under this Agreement and the Executive's benefits shall instead be determined in accordance with the Company's retirement and other applicable compensation and benefits plans and programs then in effect.
4.5 Termination for Retirement or Death.
      Following a CIC of the Company, if the Executive's employment is terminated either (i) by the Company for Cause or (ii) by the Executive (other than for Disability or death) and other than for Good Reason, no compensation or benefits shall be payable under this Agreement and the Executive's benefits shall instead be determined in accordance with the Company's applicable compensation and benefits plans and programs then in effect.
4.6 Termination for Cause or by the Executive Other Than for Good Reason or Retirement.
     Any termination by the Company or by the Executive for Good Reason under this Article 4 shall be communicated by a Notice of Termination, unless the Executive is terminated for Cause, in which case no Notice of Termination is required.

4.7 Notice of Termination.
 
CIC Tier I US
and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated.
     The payment of Severance Benefits is conditioned on the Executive's timely execution of the Non-Competition and Release Agreement. The Company will deliver the Non-Competition and Release Agreement when it provides a Notice of Termination to the Executive or promptly following the Company's receipt of a Notice of Termination from the Executive. The Non-Competition and Release Agreement shall be deemed effective upon the expiration of the required waiting periods under applicable state and/or federal laws as more specifically described therein.
4.8 Delivery of Non-Competition and Release Agreement.
     To support the enforcement of the Non-Competition and Release Agreement, the parties agree that the minimum value of the Non-Competition and Release Agreement at the time this Agreement was entered into was at least 1.5 times the Executive's Base Salary that has been built into the severance formula in Section 4.3.
     In the event the terminating Executive occupies any board of directors seats solely as a Company representative, as a condition to receiving the severance set forth in Section 4.3 the Executive shall immediately resign such position upon his termination of employment with the Company, unless specifically requested in writing by the Company otherwise.
4.9 Removal From Representative Boards.

5.1 Form and Timing of Severance Benefits.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, during the 60-day period from and after a Change in Control (the "Exercise Period"), if the Committee shall determine at, or at any time after, the time of grant, an Executive holding a Option or SAR exercisable pursuant to Section 4.3(h) shall have the right, in lieu of the payment of the purchase price for the shares of the Company's common stock being purchased under the Option or SAR and by giving notices to the Company, to elect (within the Exercise Period) to surrender all or part of the Option or SAR to the Company and to receive cash, within 30 days of such notice, in an amount equal to the amount by which the Change in Control Price per share on the date of such election shall exceed the purchase price per share of Company's common stock under the Option or SAR (the "spread") multiplied by the number of shares of the Company's common stock granted under the Option or SAR as to which the right granted under this Section 5.2 shall have been exercised.
5.2 Treatment of Certain Equity Awards.
     The Company shall be entitled to withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement all taxes as legally shall be required (including, without limitation, any United States federal taxes and any other state, city, or local taxes).
5.3 Withholding of Taxes.
 
CIC Tier I US
Article 6. The Company's Payment Obligation
     Except as provided in this Article 6 and Article 7 , the Company's obligation to make the payments and the arrangements provided for hereof shall be absolute and unconditional, and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, any offset, counterclaim, recoupment, defense, or other right that the Company may have against the Executive or anyone else. All amounts payable by the Company hereunder shall be paid without notice or demand. Except as provided in this Article 6 and in Article 7, each and every payment made hereunder by the Company shall be final, and the Company shall not seek to recover all or any part of such payment from the Executive or from whosoever may be entitled thereto, for any reasons whatsoever.
6.1 Payment Obligations Absolute.
     The Executive shall not be obligated to seek other employment in mitigation of the amounts payable or arrangements made under any provision of this Agreement, and the obtaining of any such other employment shall in no event effect any reduction of the Company's obligations to make the payments and arrangements required to be made under this Agreement.
     Subject to Article 1 and Sections 3.2 and 6.3, this Agreement establishes and vests in the Executive a contractual right to the benefits to which he may become entitled hereunder. However, nothing herein contained shall require or be deemed to require, or prohibit or be deemed to prohibit, the Company to segregate, earmark, or otherwise set aside any funds or other assets, in trust or otherwise, to provide for any payments to be made or required hereunder.
6.2 Contractual Rights to Benefits.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if it is determined by the Company that the Executive has violated any of the restrictive covenants contained in the Executive's Non-Competition and Release Agreement, the Executive shall be required to repay to the Company an amount equal to the economic value of all Severance Benefits and other payments already provided to the Executive under this Agreement and the Executive shall forever forfeit the Executive's rights to any unpaid Severance Benefits and other payments hereunder. Additional forfeiture provisions may apply pursuant to other agreements and policies between the Executive and the Company, and any such forfeiture provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
6.3 Forfeiture of Severance Benefits and Other Payments.
Article 7. Dispute Resolution
     The Executive may file a written claim with the Company's Senior Vice President of Human Resources, who shall consider such claim and notify the Executive in writing of his or her decision with respect thereto within ninety (90) days (or within such longer period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days, as the Senior Vice President of Human Resources determines is necessary to review the claim, provided that the Senior Vice President of Human Resources notifies the Executive in writing of the extension within the original ninety (90) day period). If the claim is denied, in whole or in part, the Executive may appeal such denial to the Committee, provided the Executive does so in writing within sixty (60) days of receiving the determination by the Senior Vice President of Human Resources. The Committee shall consider the appeal and notify the Executive in writing of its decision with respect thereto within sixty (60) days (or within such longer period not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days as the Committee determines is necessary to review the appeal, provided that the Committee notifies the Executive in writing of the extension within the original sixty (60) day period).
7.1 Claims Procedure.
 
CIC Tier I US
     The determination of the Committee with respect to any question arising out of or in connection with the administration, interpretation, and application of this Agreement shall be final, binding, and conclusive on all persons and shall be given the greatest deference permitted by law.
7.2 Finality of Determination.
Article 8. Outplacement Assistance
     Following a Qualifying Termination (as described in Section 4.2) the Executive shall be reimbursed by the Company for the costs of all outplacement services incurred by the Executive within the two (2) year period after the Effective Date of Termination; provided, however, that the total reimbursement shall be limited to twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) and shall be completed by the end of the calendar year in which such two (2) year period expires.
Article 9. Section 409A
     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent the Executive must be treated as a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code ("Section 409A"), any Severance Benefits due to the Executive on or within the six (6) month period following the Executive's actual termination date will accrue during such six (6) month period to the extent required by Section 409A and will become payable in a lump sum payment on the date six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of the Executive's actual termination; provided, however, that such payments will be paid earlier, at the times and on the terms set forth in the applicable provisions of this Agreement, if the Company reasonably determines that the imposition of additional tax under Section 409A will not apply to an earlier payment of such payments. In addition, this Agreement will be interpreted, operated, and administered by the Company to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to avoid imposition of any additional tax or income recognition prior to actual payment to the Executive under Section 409A, including any temporary or final Treasury regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder.
Article 10. Successors and Assignment
     The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company or of any division or subsidiary thereof to expressly assume and agree to perform the Company's obligations under this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform them if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the effective date of any such succession shall be a material breach of this Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the same terms as he would be entitled to hereunder if he had terminated his employment with the Company voluntarily for Good Reason. Except for the purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Effective Date of Termination.
10.1 Successors to the Company.
     This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees. If the Executive dies while any amount would still be payable to him hereunder had he continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive's Beneficiary. If the Executive has not named a Beneficiary, then such amounts shall be paid to the
10.2 Assignment by the Executive.
 
CIC Tier I US
Executive's devisee, legatee, or other designee, or if there is no such designee, to the Executive's estate.
Article 11. Miscellaneous
     Except as may be provided under any other agreement between the Executive and the Company, the employment of the Executive by the Company is "at will" and, prior to the effective date of a CIC, may be terminated by either the Executive or the Company at any time, subject to applicable law.
11.1 Employment Status.
     The Executive may designate one or more persons or entities as the primary and contingent Beneficiaries of any Severance Benefits owing to the Executive under this Agreement. Such designation must be in the form of a signed writing acceptable to the Committee and pursuant to such other procedures as the Committee may decide. If no such designation is on file with the Company at the time of the Executive's death, or if no designated Beneficiaries survive the Executive for more than fourteen (14) days, any Severance Benefits owing to the Executive under this Agreement shall be paid to the Executive's estate.
11.2 Beneficiaries.
     Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used herein also shall include the feminine, the plural shall include the singular, and the singular shall include the plural.
11.3 Gender and Number.
     In the event any provision of this Agreement shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included. Further, the captions of this Agreement are not part of the provisions hereof and shall have no force and effect.
11.4 Severability.
     Except as provided in Article 1 and Section 3.2, no provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived, or discharged following a CIC unless such modification, waiver, or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the Executive and by an authorized member of the Committee, or by the respective parties' legal representatives and successors.
11.5 Modification.
     This Agreement shall completely supersede and replace any and all portions of any contracts, plans, provisions, or practices pertaining to severance entitlements owing to the Executive from the Company other than the Executive Severance Agreement between the Company and the Executive dated January 1, 2010, and is in lieu of any notice requirement, policy, or practice. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the Executive's potential rights to severance pay, benefits, and notice under the Executive Change in Control Agreement (Tier I) dated January 1, 2008 (the "2008 Agreement") shall be completely replaced and superseded by this Agreement and such 2008 Agreement shall be of no further force and effect. As such, the Severance Benefits described herein shall serve as the Executive's sole recourse with respect to termination of employment by the Company following a CIC. In addition, Severance Benefits shall not be counted as "compensation," or any equivalent term, for purposes of determining benefits under other agreements, plans, provisions, or practices owing to the Executive from the Company, except to the extent expressly provided therein. Except as otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement, the Executive's rights under all such agreements, plans, provisions, and practices continue to be subject to the respective terms and conditions thereof.
11.6 Effect of Agreement.
 
CIC Tier I US
     To the extent not preempted by the laws of the United States, the laws of the state of Washington shall be the controlling law in all matters relating to this Agreement.

11.4 Severability.

As such, the Severance Benefits described herein shall serve as the Executive's sole recourse with respect to termination of employment by the Company other than a termination that entitles the Executive to severance benefits under the terms of the CIC Agreement. In addition, Severance Benefits shall not be counted as "compensation," or any equivalent term, for purposes of determining benefits under other agreements, plans, provisions, or practices owing to the Executive from the Company, except to the extent expressly provided therein.

     Pursuant to your Grant Notice (the "Grant Notice") and these Restricted Stock Award Terms and Conditions, Weyerhaeuser Company has granted you under its 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan") the number of restricted stock awards ("Awards") indicated in your Grant Notice at the market value indicated in your Grant Notice. You may decline this Grant by notifying within one month of the grant date. In the event you decline this Grant, you will not be entitled to any award, benefit, or other compensation in lieu thereof.
sally.wagner@weyerhaeuser.com
     Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this document but defined in the Plan have the definitions given to such terms in the Plan. Awards represent the Company's unfunded and unsecured promise to issue shares of Company Common Stock to you at a future date, subject to the terms of this document and the Plan. You have no rights under the Awards other than the rights of a general unsecured creditor of the Company. In addition, the Awards have the following terms and conditions:
1. . The Awards will vest over a period of four years. No part of the Awards will vest until the one-year anniversary of the Grant Date. On the one-year anniversary of the Grant Date, 25% of the Awards will vest, with an additional 25% of the Awards vesting on each of the second, third and fourth anniversary of the Grant Date. As of the fourth anniversary of the Grant Date, 100% of the Awards will be vested.
Vesting
     Awards that have not vested in accordance with the preceding paragraph are subject to forfeiture as described in Section 3.
Upon each vesting of Awards, including vesting pursuant to Section 3, one share of Company Common Stock shall be issued for each Award that vests on such date (the "Shares"), subject to the terms of the Plan and this document. Thereafter, the Company will subtract from the vested Shares the whole number of Shares necessary to satisfy any required Tax Withholding Obligations as described in Section 9 hereof, and transfer the balance of the vested Shares to you. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued under this Grant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the delivery of vested Shares shall occur as soon as practicable after the vesting date, but in all events by a date which is within 2-1/2 months after the end of the calendar year in which such vesting occurs.
2. Conversion of Awards and Issuance of Shares.
If your employment terminates before the Awards vest, vesting provisions for your Awards varies depending on the reason for termination of employment.
3. Termination of Employment.
     If you die while actively employed, your Awards are automatically 100% vested.
(a) Termination Due to Death of the Participant.
 
     If you terminate employment due to retirement or early retirement, any of your Awards that are not vested as of your termination date are forfeited upon termination and no longer have any value. No Shares will be issued or issuable with respect to any portion of the Awards that are forfeited.
(b) Termination of Employment Due to Retirement or Early Retirement.
     If your employment is terminated as a result of position elimination (regardless of your eligibility for retirement or early retirement), the Awards that are scheduled to vest at the next upcoming vesting date are automatically vested. All remaining Awards that have not vested are forfeited.
(c) Termination of Employment Due to Position Elimination.
     If you terminate employment due to Disability or Disability Retirement, your Awards are automatically 100% vested.
(d) Termination of Employment Due to Disability or Disability Retirement
.
     As defined by the Company's Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees, "Disability" means "a medical condition in which a Participant is either entitled to total and permanent disability benefits under the Social Security Act or judged to be totally and permanently disabled by the Administrative Committee or any person or committee delegated by the Administrative Committee to make such determinations." "Disability Retirement" means retirement as a result of a Disability, the onset of which occurred on or after the date you had accrued 10 years of Vesting Service
.
     If your employment is terminated for any reason other than death, position elimination, Retirement, Early Retirement, Disability or Disability Retirement, any Awards that are not vested are immediately forfeited.
(e) Termination of Employment for Reason Other than Death, Position Elimination, Retirement, Early Retirement, Disability or Disability Retirement.
     If your employment is terminated for Cause, any Awards that are not vested are immediately forfeited at the time the Company first notifies you of your termination for Cause. In addition, if your employment or service relationship is suspended pending an investigation of whether you will be terminated for Cause, and, at the conclusion of such investigation, your employment or service relationship is terminated for Cause, all Awards that vested during such period of investigation shall be immediately forfeited and you shall be required to promptly repay to the Company any Shares relating to such Awards that were previously paid to you. If any facts that would constitute termination for Cause are discovered after your termination of service, any Awards that are not vested may be immediately terminated by the Committee.
(f) Termination of Employment for Cause.
     "Cause" means: (i) willful and continued failure to perform substantially your duties with the Company after the Company delivers to you written demand for substantial performance specifically identifying the manner in which you have not substantially performed your duties; (ii) conviction of a felony; or (iii) willfully engaging in illegal conduct or gross misconduct that is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company.
     Except as otherwise specifically provided in this document, you will not be entitled to any rights of a shareholder with respect to Awards that have not vested. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company declares and pays dividends on Common Stock during the time period when unvested Awards are outstanding, you will be
4. Dividends.
 
credited with additional amounts for each unvested Award equal to the dividend that would have been paid with respect to such unvested Award if it had been an actual share of Common Stock, which amount shall remain subject to restrictions (and as determined by the Administrator may be reinvested in unvested Awards) and shall vest concurrently with the vesting of the unvested Awards upon which such dividend equivalent amounts were paid.
You will not have any voting or any other rights as a shareholder of the Common Stock with respect to the unvested Awards. Upon vesting of the Awards and issuance of shares of Common Stock, you will obtain full voting and other rights as a shareholder of the Company.
5. No Rights as Shareholder Until Vesting.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this award document, you may not sell the Shares acquired upon vesting of the Awards unless such Shares are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or, if such Shares are not then so registered, such sale would be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The sale of such Shares must also comply with other applicable laws and regulations governing the Shares and you may not sell the Shares if the Company determines that such sale would not be in material compliance with such laws and regulations.
6. Securities Law Compliance.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this award document, you may not sell, pledge, assign, hypothecate, transfer or dispose of your Awards in any manner prior to the distribution to you of shares of Company common stock in respect of such Awards. Awards shall not be subject to execution, attachment or other process.
7. Non-Transferability of Awards.
Determining the actual tax consequences of receiving or disposing of the Awards and Shares may be complicated. These tax consequences will depend, in part, on your specific situation and also may depend on the resolution of currently uncertain tax law and other variables not within the control of the Company. You should consult a competent and independent tax advisor for a full understanding of the specific tax consequences to you of receiving or disposing of Awards and Shares. You are encouraged to consult with a competent tax advisor independent of the Company to obtain tax advice concerning the receipt, vesting or disposition of the Awards or Shares in light of your specific situation.
8. Independent Tax Advice.
You are ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed in connection with the Awards, including federal, state, local, FICA, or foreign taxes of any kind required by law, regardless of any action the Company takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Awards. The Company makes no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the Grant or vesting of the Awards or the subsequent sale of Shares issuable pursuant to the Awards. The Company does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the Awards to reduce or eliminate your tax liability.
9. Taxes and Withholding.
     When an event occurs in connection with the Awards (e.g., vesting) that the company determines results in any domestic or foreign tax withholding obligation, whether national, federal, state or local, including any social tax obligation (the "Tax Withholding Obligation"), , the Company may retain without notice from Shares issuable under the Awards or from salary or other amounts payable to you, whole Shares or cash having a value sufficient to satisfy your Tax Withholding Obligation.
to the extent required by law
 
     The Company may refuse to issue any Shares to you until your Tax Withholding Obligation is satisfied.
10. . Nothing in the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan will be deemed to constitute an employment contract or confer or be deemed to confer any right for you to continue in the employ of, or to continue any other relationship with, the Company or any Related Company or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Related Company to terminate your employment or other relationship at any time, with or without cause.
Grant Not an Employment or Service Contract
11. . You will have no right to bring a claim or to receive damages if any portion of the Grant is forfeited. The loss of existing or potential profit in Awards will not constitute an element of damages in the event of your termination of service for any reason even if the termination is in violation of an obligation of the Company or a Related Company to you.
No Right to Damages
12. . The terms and conditions of this Grant will inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Company and be binding upon you and your heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.
Binding Effect
13. . (a) The Plan is discretionary in nature and may be suspended or terminated by the Company at any time; (b) The Grant is a one-time benefit that does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Awards; (c) All determinations with respect to any such future grants, including, but not limited to, the times when grants will be made, the number of Awards subject to each grant, the grant price, and the time or times when each grant will be exercisable, will be at the sole discretion of the Company; (d) Your participation in the Plan is voluntary; (e) The value of the Grant is an extraordinary item of compensation that is outside the scope of your employment contract, if any; (f) The Grant is not part of normal or expected compensation for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments; (g) The vesting of the Grant ceases upon your termination of employment for any reason and any unvested Awards will be forfeited; and (h) The future value of the Shares underlying the Grant is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty.
Limitation on Rights; No Right to Future Grants; Extraordinary Item of Compensation
14. . By receiving this Grant, you (a) authorize the Company and your employer, if different, and any agent of the Company administering the Plan or providing Plan recordkeeping services, to disclose to the Company or any of its affiliates any information and data the Company requests in order to facilitate the grant of the Award and the administration of the Plan; (b) waive any data privacy rights you may have with respect to such information; and (c) authorize the Company and its agents to store and transmit such information in electronic form.

1. Vesting.
The Options will expire at the time specified in your Grant Notice. Following that date, you will no longer be able to exercise the Option. In addition, the Option may terminate earlier than the tenth anniversary if your employment with Weyerhaeuser Company ceases for any reason. Transfer of employment between or among the Company and its subsidiaries is not considered termination of employment. Options that are not vested before their expiration date are forfeited and without value.
2. Term.
If your employment terminates before the Option has expired, the length of time during which you have a right to exercise the Option varies depending on the reason for termination of employment.
3. Change in Option Term as a Result of Termination of Employment.
     During your lifetime, this Option may be exercised only by you. If you die while actively employed, your Option is automatically 100% vested and your beneficiary or personal representative may exercise the Option at any time or from time to time within a maximum of one year after your date of death or during the remaining term of the grant if that is a shorter period of time.
(a) Termination as a Result of Death of the Participant.
     If you qualify for retirement at the time of termination (after reaching age 65 or after reaching age 62 with 10 years or more of Vesting Service as defined in the Weyerhaeuser Company Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees), your Option is automatically 100% vested at your retirement date and you will be able to exercise the Option for the remaining term of the grant, up to a maximum of 10 years.
(b) Termination of Employment upon Retirement.
     If you retire before age 62, but not earlier than your 55 birthday and you also have accrued a total of 10 years of Vesting Service (as defined in the Weyerhaeuser Company Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees) ("Early Retirement"), any portion of your Option that is not vested as of your retirement date is

th
 
forfeited and no longer has any value. You will be able to exercise any portion of your Option that has vested within a maximum of five years from your termination date, or during the remaining term of the grant if that is a shorter period of time.
     If your employment is terminated as a result of position elimination your Option will continue to vest for one year following your termination. All remaining unvested options will be cancelled. You will be able to exercise vested Options within a maximum of three years from the date of termination, or during the remaining term of the grant if that is a shorter period of time.
(d) Termination of Employment Due to Position Elimination.
     If your employment is terminated as a result Disability or Disability Retirement, your Option is automatically 100% vested. You will be able to exercise vested Options within a maximum of one year from the date of termination, or during the remaining term of the grant if that is a shorter period of time.
(e) Termination of Employment Due to Disability or Disability Retirement.
     As defined by the Company's Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees, "Disability" means "a medical condition in which a Participant is either entitled to total and permanent disability benefits under the Social Security Act or judged to be totally and permanently disabled by the Administrative Committee or any person or committee delegated by the Administrative Committee to make such determinations." "Disability Retirement" means retirement as a result of a Disability, the onset of which occurred on or after the date you had accrued 10 years of Vesting Service.
     If your employment is terminated for any reason other than death, position elimination, Retirement, Early Retirement or Disability Retirement, any portion of your Option that is not vested is forfeited and no longer has any value. You will be able to exercise any portion of your Option that has vested as of the date of your termination for a maximum of three calendar months from the date of termination, or during the remaining term of the grant if that is a shorter period of time.
(e) Termination of Employment for Reason Other than Death, Position Elimination, Retirement, Early Retirement or Disability Retirement.
     The vested portion of the Option will automatically expire at the time the Company first notifies you of your Termination for Cause, unless the Committee determines otherwise. If your employment or service relationship is suspended pending an investigation of whether you will be terminated for Cause, all your rights under the Option likewise will be suspended during the period of investigation. If any facts that would constitute termination for Cause are discovered after your Termination of Service, any Option you then hold may be immediately terminated by the Committee.
(f) Termination of Employment for Cause.
     "Cause" means: (i) willful and continued failure to perform substantially your duties with the Company after the Company delivers to you written demand for substantial performance specifically identifying the manner in which you have not substantially performed your duties; (ii) conviction of a felony; or (iii) willfully engaging in illegal conduct or gross misconduct that is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company.
     The Option must be exercised within three months after termination of employment for reasons other than death or Disability and one year after termination of employment due to Disability to qualify for the beneficial tax treatment afforded Incentive Stock Options.
It is your responsibility to be aware of the date the Option terminates.
 
4. . Notwithstanding any other provision of this grant, you may not exercise the Option unless the Shares issuable upon exercise are registered under the Securities Act or if the Company has determined that such exercise and issuance would be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The exercise of the Option must also comply with other applicable laws and regulations governing the Option, and you may not exercise the Option if the Company determines that such exercise would not be in compliance with such laws and regulations.
Securities Law Compliance
5. . If your Option is designated as an Incentive Stock Option in your Grant Notice, all or a portion of the Option is intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option under federal income tax law. However, the Company does not represent or guarantee that the Option qualifies as such.

In addition, a portion of the Option may be treated as a Nonqualified Stock Option if certain events cause exercisability of the Option to accelerate.
6. . To the extent the Option has been designated as an Incentive Stock Option, to obtain certain tax benefits afforded to Incentive Stock Options, you must hold the Shares issued upon the exercise of the Option for two years after the Grant Date and one year after the date of exercise. If shares of stock obtained upon exercise of an Incentive Stock Option are tendered to pay the exercise price for another option less than one year after the exercise date of the Incentive Stock Option, the tender will be considered a disqualifying disposition. You may be subject to the alternative minimum tax at the time of exercise. You should obtain tax advice when exercising the Option and prior to the disposition of the Shares. By accepting an Option designated as an Incentive Stock Option, you agree to promptly notify the Company if you dispose of any of the Shares within one year from the date you exercise all or part of the Option or within two years from the Grant Date.

You may make this payment in any combination of the following: (a) by cash; (b) by check acceptable to the Company; (c) by tendering (either actually or by attestation) shares of Common Stock you have owned for at least six months (if such holding period is necessary to avoid a charge to the Company's earnings); (d) to the extent permitted by law, by instructing a broker to deliver to the Company the total payment required in accordance with procedures established by the Company; or (e) by any other method permitted by the Committee.
