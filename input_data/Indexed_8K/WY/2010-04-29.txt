Weyerhaeuser Reports First Quarter Results
(April 29, 2010)  Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE: WY) today reported a net loss of $20 million for the first quarter, or 10 cents per share, on net sales of $1.4 billion.
FEDERAL WAY, Wash.
This compares with a net loss of $264 million, or $1.25 per share, on net sales from continuing operations of $1.3 billion for the same period last year.
SIGNIFICANT FIRST QUARTER 2010 AFTER-TAX ITEMS
 
Excluding these items, the company reported a net loss of $15 million, or 7 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2010.
SIGNIFICANT FIRST QUARTER 2009 AFTER-TAX ITEMS
 
Excluding these items, the company's net loss was $144 million, or 68 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2009.
"After many difficult quarters, we're encouraged by the improvement in our performance," said Dan Fulton, president and chief executive officer. "Financial results increased significantly compared with the prior quarter and on a year-over-year basis due to better market conditions and the work we've done to improve our long-term competitiveness. While the pace of the housing recovery remains uncertain, we're moving in the right direction. In addition, recent approvals by our shareholders make it possible to complete our strategic conversion to a REIT."
SUMMARY OF FIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
 
SEGMENT RESULTS FOR FIRST QUARTER
(Contributions (Charges) to Pre-Tax Earnings)
 
TIMBERLANDS
 
Excluding fourth quarter charges of $15 million for asset impairments, primarily in international manufacturing operations, the segment's earnings improved $53 million in the first quarter.
1Q 2010 Performance 
First quarter included pre-tax gains of $31 million from disposition of non-strategic timberlands, compared to $6 million in the fourth quarter. Earnings from operations increased due to improved log price realizations, higher fee volumes, and lower unit costs for logging, trucking and roads. Silviculture spending declined, primarily due to weather. Losses related to international operations, excluding the pre-tax items noted above, were $4 million in the first quarter compared to $6 million in the fourth quarter.
Excluding the disposition of non-strategic timberlands, Weyerhaeuser expects second quarter operating earnings from the segment to be somewhat lower than first quarter, as higher log prices are offset by increased silviculture and road costs and lower fee timber harvest in the south.
2Q 2010 Outlook 
WOOD PRODUCTS
 
Excluding the pre-tax items noted below, the segment's results improved by $60 million, resulting in a significantly smaller loss in the first quarter.
1Q 2010 Performance 
 
 
Lumber and oriented strand board sales realizations increased substantially, and operating rates improved. These improvements were partially offset by higher log costs.
Weyerhaeuser expects the segment to be profitable in the second quarter. The company anticipates improved operating rates, sales realizations and volumes, partially offset by higher log costs.
2Q 2010 Outlook 
CELLULOSE FIBERS
 
Excluding the pre-tax items noted below, the segment's earnings declined $15 million in the first quarter.
1Q 2010 Performance 
 
 
Higher average price realizations were offset by increased annual maintenance, fiber, and freight costs and somewhat lower shipment volumes.
Weyerhaeuser expects second quarter earnings from the segment to improve significantly compared to the first quarter. The company anticipates higher pulp price realizations, partially offset by increased freight and slightly higher annual maintenance costs.
2Q 2010 Outlook 
REAL ESTATE
 
Excluding $100 million of fourth quarter asset impairments, restructuring, and investment related charges, the segment's first quarter results improved by $20 million.
1Q 2010 Performance 
Improved first quarter operating results were primarily due to gains of $33 million on the sale of two commercial partnership interests. First quarter also included gains of $3 million on the sale of land and lots, compared to losses of $10 million in the fourth quarter. Home sale closings declined seasonally to 393 single-family homes, a 49 percent decrease from fourth quarter. Market conditions remain fragile. The average price of homes closed declined 7 percent from the previous quarter due to mix. Selling expenses declined due to lower volumes and cost improvements.
Weyerhaeuser expects second quarter results from single-family homebuilding operations to be comparable to the first quarter. The company anticipates an increase in home sale closings, offset by lower average sales prices due to mix.
