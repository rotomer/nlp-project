On June 10, 2010, the Company's Board of Directors amended the Company's Bylaws effective immediately to clarify indemnification rights of Directors and officers and eliminate supermajority voting provisions consistent with amendments previously made to the Company's Articles of Incorporation.

1. The following sentence is hereby added as the penultimate sentence of Article XII, Paragraph 1:
"Notwithstanding any amendment or repeal of this Section, or of any amendment or repeal of any of the procedures that may be established by the Board pursuant to this Section, any indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification in accordance with the provisions of these Bylaws and those procedures with respect to any acts or omissions of the indemnitee occurring prior to the amendment or repeal."
