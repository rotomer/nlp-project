Weyerhaeuser Company
(Executive)
                            
Executive Change in Control Agreement (Tier I)
THIS EXECUTIVE CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT (Tier I) is made and entered into by and between Weyerhaeuser Company (hereinafter referred to as the "Company") and (hereinafter referred to as the "Executive").
                    
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has approved the Company entering into change in control agreements with certain key executives of the Company;
WHEREAS, the Executive is a key executive of the Company;
WHEREAS, should the possibility of a Change in Control of the Company arise, the Board believes it is imperative that the Company and the Board should be able to rely on the Executive to continue in his position, and that the Company should be able to receive and rely on the Executive's advice, if requested, as to the best interests of the Company and its shareholders without concern that the Executive might be distracted by the personal uncertainties and risks created by the possibility of a Change in Control; and
WHEREAS, should the possibility of a Change in Control arise, in addition to his regular duties, the Executive may be called upon to assist in the assessment of such possible Change in Control, advise management and the Board as to whether such Change in Control would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and to take such other actions as the Board might determine to be appropriate.
NOW THEREFORE, to assure the Company that it will have the continued dedication of the Executive and the availability of his advice and counsel notwithstanding the possibility, threat, or occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company, and to induce the Executive to remain in the employ of the Company, and for other good and valuable consideration, the Company and the Executive agree as follows:
Article 1. Term of This Agreement
Subject to the provisions of Article 10, this Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and shall continue in effect for three (3) full calendar years. However, at any time prior to the end of such three-year (3) period, and at any time prior to the end of any extended term, the Committee may, in its discretion, extend the term of this Agreement for any period of time up to three (3) additional years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement is subject to annual review and may be amended or otherwise modified by the Committee in its sole discretion subsequent to such annual review, provided that no Change in Control shall have occurred.
However, in the event a Change in Control occurs during the term of this Agreement, this Agreement will remain in effect for the longer of (i) twenty-four (24) full calendar months beyond the month in which such Change in Control occurred or (ii) until all obligations of the Company to the Executive hereunder have been fulfilled, and until all benefits required hereunder have been paid to the Executive.

CIC Tier I US
 
 
To the extent that the Executive is subject to a reduction of such benefits due to application of any early retirement provisions, the three (3) additional years of age shall be incorporated in the early retirement reduction calculation so as to offset such reduction. Also, three (3) additional years of age, but not any additional service, shall be used to determine the Executive's eligibility for early retirement benefits.
 
(i) Full vesting of any Equity Awards, which shall become immediately exercisable and remain exercisable throughout their entire term;
(ii) Termination or lapsing of any restriction periods and restrictions imposed on such Equity Awards that are not performance based;

(iv) Recognition of the target payout opportunities attainable under all outstanding Equity Awards that are performance-based, which Equity Awards shall be deemed to have been fully earned for the entire performance periods and restrictions on such Equity Awards shall lapse and such Equity Awards shall be immediately settled or distributed.
Following a CIC of the Company, if the Executive's employment is terminated due to Disability, no compensation or benefits shall be payable under this Agreement and the Executive shall instead receive his Base Salary through the Effective Date of Termination, at which point in time the Executive's benefits shall be determined in accordance with the Company's disability and other applicable compensation and benefits plans and programs then in effect.
4.4 Termination for Disability.
Following a CIC of the Company, if the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of his death or voluntary Retirement other than for Good Reason, no compensation or benefits shall be payable under this Agreement and the Executive's benefits shall instead be determined in accordance with the Company's retirement and other applicable compensation and benefits plans and programs then in effect.

4.6 Termination for Cause or by the Executive Other Than for Good Reason or Retirement.
Any termination by the Company or by the Executive for Good Reason under this Article 4 shall be communicated by a Notice of Termination, which shall be delivered to the Executive no later than the Effective Date of Termination, unless the Executive is terminated for Cause, in which case no Notice of Termination is required. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a written notice that shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated.
4.7 Notice of Termination.
The payment of Severance Benefits is conditioned on the Executive's timely execution of the Non-Competition and Release Agreement. The Company will deliver the Non-Competition and Release Agreement when it provides a Notice of Termination to the Executive or promptly following the Company's receipt of a Notice of Termination from the Executive. The Non-Competition and Release Agreement shall be deemed effective upon the expiration of the required waiting periods under applicable state and/or federal laws as more specifically described therein.
4.8 Delivery of Non-Competition and Release Agreement.
To support the enforcement of the Non-Competition and Release Agreement, the parties agree that the minimum value of the Non-Competition and Release Agreement at the time this Agreement was entered into was at least 1.5 times the Executive's Base Salary that has been built into the severance formula in Section 4.3.
In the event the terminating Executive occupies any board of directors seats solely as a Company representative, as a condition to receiving the severance set forth in Section 4.3 the Executive shall immediately resign such position upon his termination of employment with the Company and in any event by the deadline for returning the Non-Competition and Release Agreement described in Section 4.8, unless specifically requested in writing by the Company otherwise.

Subject to Article 1 and Sections 3.2 and 6.3, this Agreement establishes and vests in the Executive a contractual right to the benefits to which he may become entitled hereunder. However, nothing herein contained shall require or be deemed to require, or prohibit or be deemed to prohibit, the Company to segregate, earmark, or otherwise set aside any funds or other assets, in trust or otherwise, to provide for any payments to be made or required hereunder.
6.2 Contractual Rights to Benefits.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if it is determined by the Company that the Executive has violated any of the restrictive covenants contained in the Executive's Non-Competition and Release Agreement, the Executive shall be required to repay to the Company an amount equal to the economic value of all Severance Benefits and other payments already provided to the Executive under this Agreement and the Executive shall forever forfeit the Executive's rights to any unpaid Severance Benefits and other payments hereunder.

The Committee shall consider the appeal and notify the Executive in writing of its decision with respect thereto within sixty (60) days (or within such longer period not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days as the Committee determines is necessary to review the appeal, provided that the Committee notifies the Executive in writing of the extension within the original sixty (60) day period).

The determination of the Committee with respect to any question arising out of or in connection with the administration, interpretation, and application of this Agreement shall be final, binding, and conclusive on all persons and shall be given the greatest deference permitted by law.
7.2 Finality of Determination.
Article 8. Outplacement Assistance
Following a Qualifying Termination (as described in Section 4.2) the Executive shall be reimbursed by the Company for the costs of all outplacement services incurred by the Executive within the two (2) year period after the Effective Date of Termination; provided, however, that the total reimbursement shall be limited to twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) and shall be completed by the end of the calendar year in which such two (2) year period expires.
Article 9. Section 409A
The Severance Benefits and reimbursements payable in cash to the Executive under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Severance Benefits described in Sections 4.3(a), 4.3(b), 4.3(c), 4.3(d) and 4.3(e) of this Agreement) are intended to comply with the "short term deferral" exception specified in Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(4) (or any successor provision), or otherwise be excepted from coverage under Section 409A of the Code ("Section 409A"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent an exception is not available and the Executive must be treated as a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A, any such amounts due to the Executive on or within the six (6) month period following the Executive's separation from service (as defined for purposes of Section 409A) will accrue during such six (6) month period to the extent required by Section 409A and will become payable in a lump sum payment on the date six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of the Executive's separation from service; provided, however, that such payments will be paid earlier, at the times and on the terms set forth in the applicable provisions of this Agreement, if the Company reasonably determines that the imposition of additional tax under Section 409A will not apply to an earlier payment of such payments. In addition, this Agreement will be interpreted, operated, and administered by the Company to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to avoid imposition of any additional tax or income recognition prior to actual payment to the Executive under Section 409A, including any temporary or final Treasury regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder.
Article 10. Successors and Assignment
The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company or of any division or subsidiary thereof to expressly assume and agree to perform the Company's obligations under this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform them if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the effective date of any such succession shall be a material breach of this Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the same terms as he would be entitled to hereunder if he had terminated his employment with the Company voluntarily for Good Reason. For the purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Effective Date of Termination.
10.1 Successors to the Company.
 
CIC Tier I US
 
This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees. If the Executive dies while any amount would still be payable to him hereunder had he continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive's Beneficiary.

10.2 Assignment by the Executive.
Article 11. Miscellaneous

Such designation must be in the form of a signed writing acceptable to the Committee and pursuant to such other procedures as the Committee may decide. If no such designation is on file with the Company at the time of the Executive's death, or if no designated Beneficiaries survive the Executive for more than fourteen (14) days, any Severance Benefits owing to the Executive under this Agreement shall be paid to the Executive's estate.
11.2 Beneficiaries.
Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used herein also shall include the feminine, the plural shall include the singular, and the singular shall include the plural.
11.3 Gender and Number.
In the event any provision of this Agreement shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included. Further, the captions of this Agreement are not part of the provisions hereof and shall have no force and effect.
11.4 Severability.
Except as provided in Article 1 and Section 3.2, no provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived, or discharged following a CIC unless such modification, waiver, or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the Executive and by an authorized member of the Committee, or by the respective parties' legal representatives and successors.
11.5 Modification.
 
CIC Tier I US
 
This Agreement shall completely supersede and replace any and all portions of any contracts, plans, provisions, or practices pertaining to severance entitlements owing to the Executive from the Company other than the Executive Severance Agreement between the Company and the Executive dated January 1, 2011, and is in lieu of any notice requirement, policy, or practice. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the Executive's potential rights to severance pay, benefits, and notice under the Executive Change in Control Agreement (Tier I) dated January 1, 2010 (the "2010 Agreement") shall be completely replaced and superseded by this Agreement and such 2010 Agreement shall be of no further force and effect. As such, the Severance Benefits described herein shall serve as the Executive's sole recourse with respect to termination of employment by the Company following a CIC. In addition, Severance Benefits shall not be counted as "compensation," or any equivalent term, for purposes of determining benefits under other agreements, plans, provisions, or practices owing to the Executive from the Company, except to the extent expressly provided therein. Except as otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement, the Executive's rights under all such agreements, plans, provisions, and practices continue to be subject to the respective terms and conditions thereof.

Article 3. Participation and Continuing Eligibility under this Agreement
Subject to Section 3.2, as well as the remaining terms of this Agreement, the Executive shall remain eligible to receive benefits hereunder during the term of this Agreement.
3.1 Participation.
In the event the Executive's job classification is reduced below the minimum level required for eligibility to continue to be covered by severance protection as determined at the sole discretion of the Committee, the Committee may remove the Executive from coverage under this Agreement.

Article 4. Severance Benefits

The Executive is not eligible to receive both severance benefits under the CIC Agreement and Severance Benefits hereunder. Accordingly, if the Executive receives severance benefits under the CIC Agreement, he shall not receive Severance Benefits hereunder. However, if the Executive suffers a Qualifying Termination, and if the Company has undergone a CIC such that the Executive's Effective Date of Termination falls within the window period described in Section 4.2 of the CIC Agreement, the Executive's total Severance Benefits shall equal the amounts described as severance benefits under the CIC Agreement (potentially requiring additional payments to the extent the amounts already paid as Severance Benefits hereunder do not equal the amounts payable as severance benefits under the CIC Agreement).
 
Severance Tier I US
 
An involuntary termination of the Executive's employment by the Company, authorized by the Company's Senior Vice President of Human Resources, for reasons other than Cause, mandatory Retirement under the Company's applicable policies, or the Executive's death, Disability, or voluntary termination of employment (whether by Retirement or otherwise) at any time other than within twenty-four (24) full calendar months following the effective date of a CIC shall trigger the payment of Severance Benefits to the Executive under this Agreement.
4.2 Qualifying Termination.
Subject to the conditions of Section 4.6, in the event that the Executive becomes entitled to receive Severance Benefits, as provided in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, the Company shall pay to the Executive and provide him with the following:
4.3 Description of Severance Benefits.
 
 
 
 
 
If the Executive's employment is terminated either (i) by the Company for Cause or (ii) by the Executive, the Company shall pay the Executive his full Base Salary and accrued vacation through the last day worked, at the rate then in effect, plus all other amounts to which the Executive is entitled under any compensation plans of the Company, at the time such payments are due, and the Company shall have no further obligations to the Executive under this Agreement.
4.4 Termination for Cause or by the Executive.
 
Severance Tier I US
 
Any termination by the Company under this Article 4 shall be communicated by a Notice of Termination, which shall be delivered to the Executive no later than the Effective Date of Termination, unless the Executive is terminated for Cause, in which case no Notice of Termination is required. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a written notice that shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated.
4.5 Notice of Termination.
The payment of Severance Benefits is conditioned on the Executive's timely execution of the Non-Competition and Release Agreement. The Company will deliver the Non-Competition and Release Agreement when it provides a Notice of Termination to the Executive. The Non-Competition and Release Agreement shall be deemed effective upon the expiration of the required waiting periods under any applicable state and/or federal laws, as more specifically described therein.
4.6 Delivery of Non-Competition and Release Agreement.
To support the enforcement of the Non-Competition and Release Agreement, the parties agree that the minimum value of the Non-Competition and Release Agreement at the time this Agreement was entered into was at least 1.5 times the Executive's Base Salary which has been built into the severance formula contained in Section 4.3.
In the event the terminating the Executive occupies any board of directors seats solely as a Company representative, as a condition to receiving the severance set forth in Section 4.3, the Executive shall immediately resign such position upon his termination of employment with the Company and in any event by the deadline for returning the Non-Competition and Release Agreement described in Section 4.6, unless specifically requested in writing by the Company otherwise.

The Severance Benefits described in Sections 4.3(a), (b), (c) and (e) shall be paid in cash to the Executive in a single lump sum, subject to the Non-Competition and Release Agreement described in Section 4.6, as soon as practicable following the Effective Date of Termination, but in no event beyond thirty (30) days from the later of the Effective Date of Termination and the successful expiration of the waiting periods described in Section 4.6 and in no event later than the payment deadline for short-term deferrals under Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(4) (or any successor provision).

Except as provided in this Article 6 and in Article 7, the Company's obligation to make the payments and the arrangements provided for herein shall be absolute and unconditional, and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, any offset, counterclaim, recoupment, defense, or other right that the Company may have against the Executive or anyone else.

Severance Tier I US
 
Subject to Sections 3.2 and 6.3, this Agreement establishes and vests in the Executive a contractual right to the benefits to which he may become entitled hereunder.

6.2 Contractual Rights to Benefits.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if it is determined by the Company that the Executive has violated any of the restrictive covenants contained in the Executive's Non-Competition and Release Agreement, the Executive shall be required to repay to the Company an amount equal to the economic value of all Severance Benefits and other payments already provided to the Executive under this Agreement and the Executive shall forever forfeit the Executive's rights to any unpaid Severance Benefits and other payments hereunder. Additional forfeiture provisions may apply pursuant to other agreements and policies between the Executive and the Company, and any such forfeiture provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
6.3 Forfeiture of Severance Benefits and Other Payments.
Article 7. Dispute Resolution
The Executive may file a written claim with the Company's Senior Vice President of Human Resources, who shall consider such claim and notify the Executive in writing of his decision with respect thereto within ninety (90) days (or within such longer period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days, as the Senior Vice President of Human Resources determines is necessary to review the claim, provided that the Senior Vice President of Human Resources notifies the Executive in writing of the extension within the original ninety (90) day period).

This Agreement shall be binding on the successors of the Company.

This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees.

Such designation must be in the form of a signed writing acceptable to the Committee and pursuant to such other procedures as the Committee may decide. If no such designation is on file with the Company at the time of the Executive's death, or if no designated Beneficiaries survive the Executive for more than fourteen (14) days, any Severance Benefits owing to the Executive under this Agreement shall be paid to the Executive's estate.
11.2 Beneficiaries.
 
Severance Tier I US
 
Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used herein also shall include the feminine, the plural shall include the singular, and the singular shall include the plural.
11.3 Gender and Number.
In the event any provision of this Agreement shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included. Further, the captions of this Agreement are not part of the provisions hereof and shall have no force and effect.
11.4 Severability.
Except as provided in Article 1 and Section 3.2, no provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived, or discharged following the Effective Date of Termination unless such modification, waiver, or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the Executive and by an authorized member of the Committee, or by the respective parties' legal representatives and successors.
11.5 Modification.
This Agreement shall completely supersede and replace any and all portions of any contracts, plans, provisions, or practices pertaining to severance entitlements owing to the Executive from the Company other than the CIC Agreement, and is in lieu of any notice requirement, policy, or practice. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the Executive's potential rights to severance pay, benefits, and notice under the Weyerhaeuser Company the Executive Severance Agreement (Tier I) dated January 1, 2010 (the "2010 Agreement") shall be completely replaced and superseded by this Agreement and the 2010 Agreement shall be of no further force and effect. As such, the Severance Benefits described herein shall serve as the Executive's sole recourse with respect to termination of employment by the Company other than a termination that entitles the Executive to severance benefits under the terms of the CIC Agreement. In addition, Severance Benefits shall not be counted as "compensation," or any equivalent term, for purposes of determining benefits under other agreements, plans, provisions, or practices owing to the Executive from the Company, except to the extent expressly provided therein. Except as otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement, the Executive's rights under all such agreements, plans, provisions, and practices continue to be subject to the respective terms and conditions thereof.

4.1 Authorized Number of Shares
(a) Subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 4.1, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan shall be 10,033,509.
 
(b) In the event a company acquired by the Company or with which the Company combines ("Acquisition Party") has shares available for awards or grants under a pre-existing plan not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition or combination, to the extent determined by the Committee or the Board, a number of shares of Common Stock determined by applying the exchange ratio or other adjustment or valuation ratio or formula used in such acquisition or combination to determine the consideration payable to the holders of common stock of the Acquisition Party to the number of shares available for grant under the terms of such pre-existing plan shall be available for Awards under the Plan and shall not reduce the shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the Plan; provided, that such Awards shall not be made after the date awards or grants could have been made under the terms of the pre-existing plan, absent the acquisition or combination; and provided, further, that such Awards shall be made only to individuals who were not employees or non-employee directors of the Company or a Related Company prior to such acquisition or combination.
(c) Shares available for issuance under the Plan shall be increased by any shares subject to outstanding awards under the Company's Prior Plans on the date of shareholder approval of the Plan that cease to be subject to such awards (other than by reason of exercise or settlement of the awards to the extent they are exercised for or settled in shares of Common Stock), subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 4.1, which shares of Common Stock shall cease, as of such date, to be available for grant and issuance under the Prior Plans, but shall be available for issuance under the Plan.
(d) In the event, at any time or from time to time, a stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, distribution to shareholders other than a normal cash dividend or other change in the Company's corporate or capital structure results in (i) the outstanding shares of Common Stock, or any securities exchanged therefore or received in their place, being exchanged for a different number or kind of securities of the Company or of any other company or (ii) new, different or additional securities of the Company or of any other company being received by the holders of shares of Common Stock, then the Committee shall make proportional adjustments in (A) the maximum number and kind of securities available for issuance under the Plan; (B) the maximum number and kind of securities issuable as Incentive Stock Options as set forth in Section 4.2; (C) the maximum number and kind of securities that may be issued to an individual in any one calendar year as set forth in Section 4.3; (D) the maximum number and kind of securities that may be made subject to the different types of Awards available under the Plan; and (E) the number and kind of securities that are subject to any outstanding Award and the per share price of such securities, without any change in the aggregate price to be paid therefor.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, for cash or property, or for labor or services rendered, either upon direct sale or upon the exercise of rights or warrants to subscribe therefore, or upon conversion of shares or obligations of the Company convertible into such shares or other securities, shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, outstanding Awards.
 
4.2 Share Usage
(a) Shares of Common Stock covered by an Award shall not be counted as used unless and until they are actually issued and delivered to a Participant. If any Award based on shares is settled for cash, or lapses, expires, terminates or is canceled prior to the issuance of shares thereunder, the shares subject to such Awards shall again be available for issuance under the Plan. In the event that any Option or other Award granted hereunder is exercised through the tendering of shares (either actually or by attestation) or in the event that withholding tax liabilities arising from such Award are satisfied by the tendering of shares or by the withholding of shares by the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock issued net of the shares of Common Stock tendered or withheld shall be counted for purposes of determining the maximum number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan. In addition, Substitute Awards shall not reduce the shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the Plan. The number of shares available for issuance under the Plan shall not be reduced to reflect any dividends or dividend equivalents that are reinvested into additional shares or credited as additional Restricted Stock, Stock Units, Performance Shares or Performance Units. All shares issued under the Plan shall be authorized and unissued shares.
(b) The Committee shall have the authority to grant Awards as an alternative to or as the form of payment for grants or rights earned or due under other compensation plans or arrangements of the Company.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum number of shares that may be issued upon the exercise of Incentive Stock Options shall be 10,033,509, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.1(d); and provided, further, that for purposes of Section 4.3, any such shares shall be counted in accordance with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.

(c) Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.1(d), the aggregate number of shares that may be issued pursuant to Awards granted under the Plan (other than Awards of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights) that (i) are not (A) subject to restrictions based on the satisfaction of specified performance goals or (B) granted in lieu of the payment of performance-based cash incentive awards; or (ii) contain no restrictions or contain restrictions based solely on continuous employment or services for less than three years (except where Termination of Service occurs by reason of death, Retirement, Disability or Layoff) shall not exceed 5% of the authorized number of shares pursuant to Section 4.1(a).
 
An Award may be granted to any employee, officer or director of the Company or a Related Company whom the Committee from time to time selects. The above are "eligible persons."
6.1 Form and Grant of Awards
The Committee shall have the authority, in its sole discretion, to determine the type or types of Awards to be granted under the Plan. Such Awards may be granted either alone, in addition to or in tandem with any other type of Award.
6.2 Evidence of Awards
Awards granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by a written instrument that shall contain such terms, conditions, limitations and restrictions as the Committee shall deem advisable and that are not inconsistent with the Plan.
7.1 Grant of Options
The Committee may grant Options designated as Incentive Stock Options or Non-qualified Stock Options.
7.2 Option Exercise Price
The exercise price for shares purchased under an Option shall be as determined by the Committee, but shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock for the Grant Date, except in the case of Substitute Awards. In no event shall the Committee, without the prior approval of the Company's shareholders, cancel any outstanding Option for the purpose of reissuing the Option to the Participant at a lower exercise price or reduce the exercise price of an outstanding Option.
7.3 Terms of Options
Subject to earlier termination in accordance with the terms of the Plan and the instrument evidencing the Option, the maximum term of an Option shall be as established for that Option by the Committee or, if not so established, shall be 10 years from the Grant Date.
7.4 Exercise of Options
(a) The Committee shall establish and set forth in each instrument that evidences an Option the time at which, or the installments in which, the Option shall vest and become exercisable, any of which provisions may be waived or modified by the Committee at any time.
(b) To the extent an Option has vested and become exercisable, the Option may be exercised in whole or from time to time in part by delivery as directed by the Company to the Company or a brokerage firm designated or approved by the Company of a written stock option exercise agreement or notice, in a form and in accordance with procedures established by the Committee, setting forth the number of shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised, the restrictions imposed on the shares purchased under such exercise agreement, if any, and such representations and agreements as may be required by the Committee, accompanied by payment in full as described in Section 7.5. An Option may be exercised only for whole shares and may not be exercised for less than a reasonable number of shares at any one time, as determined by the Committee.
 
7.5 Payment of Exercise Price
The exercise price for shares purchased under an Option shall be paid in full as directed by the Company to the Company or a brokerage firm designated or approved by the Company by delivery of consideration equal to the product of the Option exercise price and the number of shares purchased. Such consideration must be paid before the Company will issue the shares being purchased and must be in a form or a combination of forms acceptable to the Committee for that purchase, which forms may include: (a) check; (b) wire transfer; (c) tendering by attestation shares of Common Stock already owned by the Participant for at least six months (or any shorter period sufficient to avoid a charge to the Company's earnings for financial reporting purposes) that on the day prior to the exercise date have a Fair Market Value equal to the aggregate exercise price of the shares being purchased under the Option; (d) to the extent permitted by applicable law, delivery of a properly executed exercise notice, together with irrevocable instructions to a brokerage firm designated or approved by the Company to deliver promptly to the Company the aggregate amount of sale or loan proceeds to pay the Option exercise price and any tax withholding obligations that may arise in connection with the exercise, all in accordance with the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board; or (e) such other consideration as the Committee may permit in its sole discretion, including, where permitted by law and the Committee, other Awards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company becomes subject to new accounting rules applicable to equity-based compensation, and is required to or elects to expense the cost of Options pursuant to FAS 123 (or a successor or other standard), the Committee shall have the sole discretion to substitute, without receiving Participant permission, SARs paid only in stock for outstanding Options; provided, the terms of the substituted stock SARs are the same as the terms for the Options, the number of shares underlying the number of stock SARs equals the number of shares underlying the Options and the difference between the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares and the Grant Price of the SARs is equivalent to the difference between the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares and the Option Price of the Options.
7.6 Post-Termination Exercise
The Committee shall establish and set forth in each instrument that evidences an Option whether the Option shall continue to be exercisable, and the terms and conditions of such exercise, after a Termination of Service, any of which provisions may be waived or modified by the Committee at any time.
7.7 Incentive Stock Options
The terms of any Incentive Stock Options shall comply in all respects with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code, or any successor provision, and any regulations promulgated thereunder. Individuals who are not employees of the Company or one of its parent or subsidiary corporations (as such terms are defined for purposes of Section 422 of the Code) may not be granted Incentive Stock Options. To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of Common Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year exceeds $100,000 or, if different, the maximum limitation in effect at the time of grant under the Code (the Fair Market Value being determined as of the Grant Date for the Option), such portion in excess of $100,000 shall be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options.
 
8.1 Grant of Stock Appreciation Rights
The Committee may grant stock appreciation rights ("Stock Appreciation Rights" or "SARs") to Participants at any time. A SAR may be granted in tandem with an Option or alone ("freestanding"). The grant price of a tandem SAR shall be equal to the exercise price of the related Option, and the grant price of a freestanding SAR shall be equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock for the Grant. A SAR may be exercised upon such terms and conditions and for the term as the Committee determines in its sole discretion; provided, however, that, subject to earlier termination in accordance with the terms of the Plan and the instrument evidencing the SAR, the term of a freestanding SAR shall be as established for that SAR by the Committee or, if not so established, shall be 10 years, and in the case of a tandem SAR, (a) the term shall not exceed the term of the related Option and (b) the tandem SAR may be exercised for all or part of the shares subject to the related Option upon the surrender of the right to exercise the equivalent portion of the related Option, except that the tandem SAR may be exercised only with respect to the shares for which its related Option is then exercisable.
8.2 Payment of SAR Amount
Upon the exercise of a SAR, a Participant shall be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying: (a) the difference between the market price at which the shares of Common Stock are trading on the New York Stock Exchange as of the time of exercise over the grant price by (b) the number of shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised. At the discretion of the Committee, the payment upon exercise of a SAR may be in cash, in shares of equivalent value, in some combination thereof or in any other manner approved by the Committee in its sole discretion.
9.1 Grant of Restricted Stock and Stock Units
The Committee may grant Restricted Stock and Stock Units on such terms and conditions and subject to such repurchase or forfeiture restrictions, if any (which may be based on continuous service with the Company or a Related Company or the achievement of any of the Performance Criteria set forth in Section 11.1), as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion, which terms, conditions and restrictions shall be set forth in the instrument evidencing the Award.
9.2 Issuance of Shares
Upon the satisfaction of any terms, conditions and restrictions prescribed with respect to Restricted Stock or Stock Units, or upon a Participant's release from any terms, conditions and restrictions of Restricted Stock or Stock Units, as determined by the Committee, and subject to the provisions of Section 13, (a) the shares of Restricted Stock covered by each Award of Restricted Stock shall become freely transferable by the Participant, and (b) Stock Units shall be paid in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion. Any fractional shares subject to such Awards shall be paid to the Participant in cash.
 
9.3 Dividends and Distributions
Participants holding shares of Restricted Stock or Stock Units may, if the Committee so determines, be credited with dividends paid with respect to the underlying shares or dividend equivalents while they are so held in a manner determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. The Committee may apply any restrictions to the dividends or dividend equivalents that the Committee deems appropriate. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine the form of payment of dividends or dividend equivalents, including cash, shares of Common Stock, Restricted Stock or Stock Units.
10.1 Grant of Performance Shares
The Committee may grant Awards of performance shares ("Performance Shares") and designate the Participants to whom Performance Shares are to be awarded and determine the number of Performance Shares, the length of the performance period and the other terms and conditions of each such Award. Each Award of Performance Shares shall, upon the attainment of performance goals and other terms and conditions specified by the Committee, entitle the Participant to a payment in the form established by the Committee. The form of payment may be in cash, shares of Common Stock, Options, Share Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock or other awards or any combination of cash, shares of Common Stock, Share Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock or other awards. Notwithstanding satisfaction of any performance goals, the number of shares of Common Stock issued under an Award of Performance Shares may be adjusted on the basis of such further consideration as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion. However, the Committee may not, in any event, increase the number of shares of Common Stock earned upon satisfaction of any performance goal by any Covered Employee.
10.2 Grant of Performance Units
The Committee may grant Awards of performance units ("Performance Units") and designate the Participants to whom Performance Units are to be awarded and determine the number of Performance Units and the terms and conditions of each such Award. Performance Units shall entitle the Participant to a payment in cash upon the attainment of performance goals and other terms and conditions specified by the Committee. Notwithstanding the satisfaction of any performance goals, the amount to be paid under an Award of Performance Units may be adjusted on the basis of such further consideration as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion. However, the Committee may not, in any event, increase the amount earned under Awards of Performance Units upon satisfaction of any performance goal by any Covered Employee, and the maximum amount earned by such Covered Employee in any calendar year may not exceed $5,000,000. The Committee, in its discretion, may substitute actual shares of Common Stock for the cash payment otherwise required to be made to a Participant pursuant to a Performance Unit.
 
11.1 Awards Subject to Performance Goals
Awards of Restricted Stock, Stock Units, Performance Shares, Performance Units and other Awards made pursuant to the Plan may be made subject to the attainment of performance goals relating to one or more of the following business criteria within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code: profits (including, but not limited to, profit growth, net operating profit or economic profit); profit-related return ratios; return measures (including, but not limited to, return on assets, capital, equity or sales); cash flow (including, but not limited to, operating cash flow, free cash flow or cash flow return on capital); earnings (including, but not limited to, earnings growth, net earnings, earnings per share, or earnings before or after taxes); net sales growth; net income (before or after taxes, interest, depreciation and/or amortization); gross or operating margins; productivity ratios; share price (including, but not limited to, growth measures and total shareholder return); expense targets; margins; cost reduction; cash value added; operating efficiency; customer satisfaction; and working capital targets ("Performance Criteria"). Performance Criteria may be stated in absolute terms or relative to comparison companies or indices to be achieved during a period of time.
11.2 Use and Calculation of Performance Criteria
Any Performance Criteria may be used to measure the performance of the Company as a whole or any business unit of the Company. Any Performance Criteria may include or exclude Non-recurring Items. Performance Criteria shall be calculated in accordance with (a) the Company's financial statements or generally accepted accounting principles, or (b) under a methodology established by the Committee prior to the issuance of an Award that is consistently applied and identified in the audited financial statements, including footnotes, or the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of the Company's annual report. The Committee may not in any event increase the amount of compensation payable to a Covered Employee upon the satisfaction of any Performance Criteria.
In addition to the Awards described in Sections 7 through 10, and subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee may grant other incentives payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock under the Plan as it determines to be in the best interests of the Company and subject to such other terms and conditions as it deems appropriate; provided, however, that the maximum amount that any Participant shall be eligible to receive in any one calendar year shall be $5,000,000.
(a) The Company may require the Participant to pay to the Company the amount of (i) any taxes that the Company is required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign law to withhold with respect to the grant, vesting or exercise of an Award ("tax withholding obligations") and (ii) any amounts due from the Participant to the Company or to any Related Company ("other obligations"). The Company shall not be required to issue any shares of Common Stock under the Plan until such tax withholding obligations and other obligations are satisfied.
 
(b) The Committee may permit or require a Participant to satisfy all or part of his or her tax withholding obligations and other obligations by (i) paying cash to the Company, (ii) having the Company withhold an amount from any cash amounts otherwise due or to become due from the Company to the Participant, (iii) having the Company withhold a number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued to the Participant (or become vested in the case of Restricted Stock) having a Fair Market Value equal to the tax withholding obligations and other obligations (up to the employer's minimum required tax withholding rate if such a limitation is necessary to avoid a charge to the Company for financial reporting purposes), or (iv) surrendering a number of shares of Common Stock the Participant already owns having a value equal to the tax withholding obligations and other obligations (up to the employer's minimum required tax withholding rate to the extent the Participant has owned the surrendered shares for less that six months if such a limitation is necessary to avoid a charge to the Company for financial reporting purposes).
No Award or interest in an Award may be sold, assigned, pledged (as collateral for a loan or as security for the performance of an obligation or for any other purpose) or transferred by the Participant or made subject to attachment or similar proceedings otherwise than by will or by the applicable laws of descent and distribution, except that to the extent permitted by the Committee, in its sole discretion, a Participant may designate one or more beneficiaries on a Company-approved form who may receive payment under an Award after the Participant's death. During a Participant's lifetime, an Award may be exercised only by the Participant.
15.1 Amendment, Suspension or Termination of the Plan
The Board or the Compensation Committee of the Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or any portion of the Plan at any time and in such respects as it shall deem advisable; provided, however, that, to the extent required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule, shareholder approval shall be required for any amendment to the Plan.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Incentive Stock Options may be granted more than 10 years after April 13, 2004.
15.3 Consent of Participant
The amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan or a portion thereof or the amendment of an outstanding Award shall not, without the Participant's consent, materially adversely affect any rights under any outstanding Award under the Plan. Any change or adjustment to an outstanding Incentive Stock Option shall not, without the consent of the Participant, be made in a manner so as to constitute a "modification" that would cause such Incentive Stock Option to fail to continue to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any adjustments made pursuant to Section 4.1 shall not be subject to these restrictions.
 
16.1 No Individual Rights
(a) No individual or Participant shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and the Company has no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants under the Plan.
(b) Nothing in the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed to constitute an employment contract or confer or be deemed to confer on any Participant any right to continue in the employ of, or to continue any other relationship with, the Company or any Related Company or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Related Company to terminate a Participant's employment or other relationship at any time, with or without cause.
16.2 Issuance of Shares
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company shall have no obligation to issue or deliver any shares of Common Stock under the Plan or make any other distribution of benefits under the Plan unless, in the opinion of the Company's counsel, such issuance, delivery or distribution would comply with all applicable laws (including, without limitation, the requirements of the Securities Act or the laws of any state or foreign jurisdiction) and the applicable requirements of any securities exchange or similar entity.
(b) The Company shall be under no obligation to any Participant to register for offering or resale or to qualify for exemption under the Securities Act, or to register or qualify under the laws of any state or foreign jurisdiction, any shares of Common Stock, security or interest in a security paid or issued under, or created by, the Plan, or to continue in effect any such registrations or qualifications if made. The Company may issue certificates for shares with such legends and subject to such restrictions on transfer and stop-transfer instructions as counsel for the Company deems necessary or desirable for compliance by the Company with federal, state and foreign securities laws. The Company may also require such other action or agreement by the Participants as may from time to time be necessary to comply with applicable securities laws.
(c) To the extent the Plan or any instrument evidencing an Award provides for issuance of stock certificates to reflect the issuance of shares of Common Stock, the issuance may be effected on a non-certificated basis, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange.
16.3 No Rights as a Shareholder
Unless otherwise provided by the Committee or in the instrument evidencing the Award or in a written employment or services agreement, no Option or Award denominated in units shall entitle the Participant to any cash dividend, voting or other right of a shareholder unless and until the date of issuance under the Plan of the shares that are the subject of such Award.
 
16.4 Compliance with Laws and Regulations
(a) Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may bifurcate the Plan so as to restrict, limit or condition the use of any provision of the Plan to Participants who are officers or directors subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act without so restricting, limiting or conditioning the Plan with respect to other Participants. Additionally, in interpreting and applying the provisions of the Plan, any Option granted as an Incentive Stock Option pursuant to the Plan shall, to the extent permitted by law, be construed as an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code.
(b) The Plan and Awards granted under the Plan are intended to be exempt from the requirements of Code Section 409A to the maximum extent possible, whether pursuant to the short-term deferral exception described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), the involuntary separation pay plan exception described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), or otherwise. To the extent Code Section 409A is applicable to the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan, it is intended that the Plan and any Awards granted under the Plan comply with the deferral, payout and other limitations and restrictions imposed under Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan to the contrary, the Plan and any Award granted under the Plan shall be interpreted, operated and administered in a manner consistent with such intentions.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan to the contrary, with respect to any payments and benefits under the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan to which Code Section 409A applies, all references in the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan to the termination of the Participant's employment or service are intended to mean the Participant's "separation from service," within the meaning of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i). In addition, if the Participant is a "specified employee," within the meaning of Code Section 409, then to the extent necessary to avoid subjecting the Participant to the imposition of any additional tax under Code Section 409A, amounts that would otherwise be payable under the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan during the six-month period immediately following the Participant's "separation from service," within the meaning of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i), shall not be paid to the Participant during such period, but shall instead be accumulated and paid to the Participant (or, in the event of the Participant's death, the Participant's estate) in a lump sum on the first business day after the earlier of the date that is six months following the Participant's separation from service or the Participant's death.
Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan, the Committee, to the extent it deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, reserves the right, but shall not be required, to unilaterally amend or modify the Plan and any Award granted under the Plan so that the Award qualifies for exemption from or complies with Code Section 409A; provided, however, that the Committee makes no representations that Awards granted under the Plan shall be exempt from or comply with Code Section 409A and makes no undertaking to preclude Code Section 409A from applying to Awards granted under the Plan.
16.5 Participants in Other Countries
The Committee shall have the authority to adopt such modifications, procedures and subplans as may be necessary or desirable to comply with provisions of the laws of other countries in which the Company or any Related Company may operate to ensure the viability of the benefits from Awards granted to Participants employed in such countries, to comply with applicable foreign laws and to meet the objectives of the Plan.
 
16.6 No Trust or Fund
The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan. Nothing contained herein shall require the Company to segregate any monies or other property, or shares of Common Stock, or to create any trusts, or to make any special deposits for any immediate or deferred amounts payable to any Participant, and no Participant shall have any rights that are greater than those of a general unsecured creditor of the Company.
16.7 Successors
All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Awards shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all the business and/or assets of the Company.
16.8 Severability
If any provision of the Plan or any Award is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any person, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or, if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the Committee's determination, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Award, and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.
16.9 Choice of Law
The Plan, all Awards granted thereunder and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant hereto, to the extent not otherwise governed by the laws of the United States, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law.
16.10 Treatment of Awards Following a Change in Control
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan to the contrary, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, unless otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Award or in a written employment or other agreement between the Participant and the Company, or specifically prohibited under applicable laws, or by the rules and regulations of any governing governmental agencies or national securities exchanges:
(i) Any and all Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall become fully vested and immediately exercisable, and shall remain exercisable throughout their entire term;
(ii) Any restriction periods and restrictions imposed on Restricted Stock or Stock Unit Awards that are not performance-based shall lapse;
(iii) The target pay out opportunities attainable under all outstanding Awards that are performance-based shall be deemed to have been fully earned for the entire performance period(s) and restrictions shall lapse and such Awards shall be immediately settled or distributed;
(iv) The restrictions and other conditions applicable to any other Stock Unit Awards or any other awards shall lapse, and such other Stock Unit Awards or such other awards shall become free of all restrictions, limitations or conditions and become fully vested and transferable to the full extent of the original grant.
 
(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, (i) any adjustments made pursuant to this Section 16.10 to Awards that are considered "deferred compensation" within the meaning of Code Section 409A shall be made in compliance with the requirements of Code Section 409A and (ii) any adjustments made pursuant to this Section 16.10 to Awards that are not considered "deferred compensation" subject to Code Section 409A shall be made in such a manner as to ensure that after such adjustment the Awards either (x) continue not to be subject to Code Section 409A or (y) comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A.
The Plan is amended and restated effective December 8, 2010 (the "Effective Date").
