Weyerhaeuser Reports
Second
Quarter Results
FEDERAL WAY, Wash.
(
July 29, 2011
) - Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE: WY) today reported net earnings of $10 million for the
second
quarter, or 2 cents per diluted share, on net sales of $1.8 billion. This compares with net earnings of $14 million on net sales of $1.8 billion for the same period last year.
Earnings for the
second
quarter of 2011 include after-tax charges of $22 million from special items. Excluding these items, the company reported net earnings of $32 million, or 6 cents per diluted share. This compares with net earnings before special items of $42 million in the
second
quarter of 2010.
Net cash provided by operations for the second quarter of 2011 was $116 million, compared with $189 million for the
second
quarter of 2010. The company's cash balance decreased by $582 million in the second quarter, primarily due to repayment of debt. Weyerhaeuser ended the quarter with $881 million in cash and cash equivalents.
We are confident that our ongoing efforts to sharpen our focus and reduce costs are positioning us to achieve our goal of generating superior sustainable returns for our shareholders,  said Dan Fulton, president and chief executive officer. The recently announced agreements to sell our hardwoods and Westwood Shipping Lines operations demonstrate the focus we are placing on our strategic direction.
WEYERHAEUSER
 
Net sales from discontinued operations include the net sales of Weyerhaeuser's hardwoods and Westwood Shipping Lines businesses. These operations are reported as discontinued due to the expected sales of the businesses.
Weyerhaeuser's outstanding shares increased substantially from the
second
quarter of 2010 due to a special dividend of approximately 324 million shares of common stock and $560 million in cash, paid on Sept. 1, 2010 in conjunction with the company's conversion to a REIT.
TIMBERLANDS
 
2Q 2011
Performance -
The segment's earning before special items improved $23 million in the second quarter compared with the first. Fee harvest volumes rose, and average selling prices for western logs increased due to strong Chinese export demand through the first half of the quarter. Theres improvements were partially offset by higher fuel costs.
First quarter results included a special item pre-tax gain of $152 million from the sales of 82,000 acres of non-strategic timberlands. Excluding that transaction, earning from dispositions of non-strategic timberlands totaled $19 million in the first quarter, compared with $34 million in the second quarter.
3Q 2011
Outlook -
Weyerhaeuser expects significantly lower earnings from the Timberlands segment in the third quarter. The company anticipates lower selling prices and harvest volumes in the West and seasonally higher silviculture and road expenses. The company also expects reduced earnings from dispositions of non-strategic timberlands.
WOOD PRODUCTS
 
2Q 2011
Performance -
The segment's results before special items declined $16 million compared with the
first
quarter due to lower selling prices for lumber and oriented strand board and higher log costs. These factors were partially offset by improved sales volumes across nearly all product lines.
Second quarter includes special charges of $9 million related to the expected sale of the hardwoods business. Second quarter results before special items include operating earnings of $1 million from that business, compared with breakeven results in the first quarter.
3Q 2011
Outlook -
Excluding the hardwoods transaction, Weyerhaeuser anticipates a comparable loss from the segment in the third quarter. The company expects lower selling prices for lumber and oriented strand board and lower sales volumes across most product lines, offset by lower log costs and modest cost improvements.
CELLULOSE FIBERS
 
2Q 2011
Performance -
Second
quarter earnings declined $6 million compared with
first
quarter. Maintenance costs increased and production declined as the segment completed four planned annual maintenance outages, compared with two in the first quarter. This was partially offset by improved average selling prices. Sales volumes declined sightly, as market demand weakened late in the second quarter.
3Q 2011
Outlook -
Weyerhaeuser expects significantly higher earnings from the Cellulose Fibers segment in the
third
quarter. The company anticipates substantially lower maintenance costs and increased production, partially offset by lower selling prices for pulp.
REAL ESTATE
 
2Q 2011
Performance -
The segment's earnings increased $9 million compared with the first quarter, primarily due to seasonally higher home sale closings. Home sale closings increased 26 percent compared with the
first
quarter to 459 single-family homes. Average margins on homes closed improved slightly, but average prices declined due to mix.
Second
quarter earnings include $4 million from the sale of land and lots, compared with $1 million in the
first
quarter.
3Q 2011
Outlook -
Weyerhaeuser anticipates slightly higher earnings from single-family homebuilding operations in the
third
quarter due to a seasonal increase in home sale closings.
OTHER ITEMS
 
Interest expense for the second quarter includes a pre-tax special charge of $26 million associated with the early extinguishment of approximately $518 million of long-term debt due March 2012.
Second quarter results for the Corporate and Other segment include net pre-tax charges of $11 million for discontinued operations, including operating earnings of $2 million for Westwood Shipping Lines and charges of $13 million for other operations. First quarter results include operating earnings of $2 million for Westwood Shipping Lines.
