Weyerhaeuser Reports
Third
Quarter Results
FEDERAL WAY, Wash.
(
Oct 28, 2011
) - Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE: WY) today reported net earnings of
$157 million
for the
third
quarter, or
29 cents
per diluted share, on net sales from continuing operations of
$1.6 billion
. This compares with net earnings of
$1.116 billion
on net sales from continuing operations of
$1.5 billion
for the same period last year.
Earnings for the
third
quarter of 2011 include after-tax gains of $91 million from special items, including an
$83 million
benefit related to foreign tax credits. Excluding these items, the company reported net earnings of
$66 million
, or
12 cents
per diluted share. This compares with net earnings before special items of
$81 million
in the
third
quarter of 2010. Earnings for the third quarter of 2010 included special items of $1.035 billion, primarily income tax adjustments related to Weyerhaeuser's conversion to a real estate investment trust (REIT).
All of our businesses faced challenging markets in the third quarter, as the U.S. housing market languished and we experienced a slowdown in demand from China, said Dan Fulton, president and chief executive officer. "We remain focused on improving performance with today's level of demand, while being prepared to flex all of our operations as markets improve.
 
TIMBERLANDS
 
3Q 2011
Performance -
The segment's earnings declined
$50 million
in the third quarter compared with the
second
. Earnings from disposition of non-strategic timberlands declined to $4 million, compared with $32 million in the second quarter. Average selling prices for Western logs were lower due to weakening Chinese and domestic markets. Selling prices for Southern logs also declined. The segment's silviculture and road costs increased seasonally. Fee harvest increased slightly compared with the second quarter, as a decline in Western harvest volume was offset by increased volume in the South.
4Q 2011
Outlook -
Excluding earnings from disposition of non-strategic timberlands, Weyerhaeuser expects lower earnings from the Timberlands segment in the
fourth
quarter due to reduced fee harvest volumes and lower selling prices for Western logs. The company also anticipates seasonally higher road and silviculture costs.
WOOD PRODUCTS
 
3Q 2011
Performance -
Results from continuing operations improved
$10 million
compared with the second quarter, as reduced log costs were partially offset by slightly lower sales volumes across most product lines. Operating results for the discontinued hardwoods operations declined
$5 million
compared with the second quarter. Weyerhaeuser completed the sale of the hardwoods operations in the third quarter.
Third
quarter special charges of
$46 million
are primarily comprised of asset impairments due to the permanent closure of four engineered wood products facilities, restructuring costs, and charges related to the sale of the hardwoods operations. Second quarter included special charges of
$9 million
related to the sale of the hardwoods operations.
4Q 2011
Outlook -
Excluding special items, Weyerhaeuser anticipates a larger loss from continuing operations in the
fourth
quarter due to seasonally weaker market conditions. The company expects lower selling prices for lumber and oriented strand board and reduced sales volumes and operating rates across all product lines.
CELLULOSE FIBERS
 
3Q 2011
Performance -
Third
quarter earnings improved
$55 million
compared with
second
quarter. Maintenance costs decreased and production increased as the segment had no annual maintenance outages, compared with four planned outages in the second quarter. These improvements were partially offset by lower selling prices for pulp.
4Q 2011
Outlook -
Weyerhaeuser expects slightly lower earnings from the Cellulose Fibers segment in the
fourth
quarter. The company anticipates lower selling prices for pulp and slightly higher shipment volumes.
REAL ESTATE
 
3Q 2011
Performance -
The segment's earnings increased
$2 million
compared with the
second
quarter. Home closings increased 11 percent to
508
single-family homes. Average margins on homes closed improved due to mix. Third quarter included no earnings from the sale of land and lots, compared with $4 million in the second quarter.
4Q 2011
Outlook -
Weyerhaeuser anticipates higher earnings from single-family homebuilding operations in the
fourth
quarter due to seasonally higher home closing volume.
CORPORATE AND OTHER
 
Corporate and Other results from continuing operations declined
$5 million
, as foreign exchange losses reduced the segment's results by $18 million compared with the second quarter. This was offset primarily by $7 million of additional gains related to share-based compensation, as a decline in the company's stock price resulted in a larger mark-to-market adjustment.
Third quarter includes pre-tax gains of
$58 million
from special items, primarily the sale of Westwood Shipping Lines.
