Exhibit 99.1
Weyerhaeuser Reports
Fourth
Quarter, Full Year Results
FEDERAL WAY, Wash.
(
Feb 3, 2012
) - Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE: WY) today reported net earnings of
$65 million
for the
fourth
quarter, or
12 cents
per diluted share, on net sales from continuing operations of
$1.6 billion
. This compares with net earnings of
$171 million
, or
32 cents
per diluted share, on net sales from continuing operations of
$1.5 billion
for the same period last year.
Earnings for the
fourth
quarter of 2011 include net after-tax charges of $12 million for restructuring and asset impairments. Excluding these items, the company reported net earnings of
$77 million
, or
14 cents
per diluted share. This compares with net earnings before special items of
$52 million
in the
fourth
quarter of 2010.
For the full year 2011, Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings of
$331 million
, or
$0.61
per diluted share, on net sales from continuing operations of
$6.2 billion
. This compares with net earnings of
$1.281 billion
on net sales from continuing operations of
$6.0 billion
for the full year 2010. Earnings for the full year 2010 include $1.064 billion from income tax adjustments related to Weyerhaeuser's conversion to a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).
In 2011 we took full advantage of opportunities to improve our performance in a weaker than expected US housing market, said Dan Fulton, president and chief executive officer. In Timberlands, we used our long term competitive strength in the Asian export markets to capitalize on emerging Chinese demand. Cellulose Fibers leveraged strong customer relationships and excellent operational performance to deliver a second consecutive year of record financial results. Our Real Estate business maintained profitability despite challenging market conditions, and Wood Products generated improved results. Through the sale of our hardwoods and Westwood Shipping Lines businesses we sharpened our strategic direction, and we remain focused on improving performance to generate superior sustainable returns for our shareholders in 2012.
 
TIMBERLANDS
 
4Q 2011
Performance -
The segment's earnings improved
$8 million
in the fourth quarter compared with the
third
. Earnings from disposition of non-strategic timberlands increased $17 million to $21 million, compared with $4 million in the third quarter. Average selling prices for Western logs declined due to weaker Chinese export demand. These declines were partially offset by increased log sales volumes and slightly higher selling prices in the South. Fee harvest volumes rose, primarily in the South. Silviculture and road costs were lower, and fuel costs increased.
1Q 2012
Outlook -
Excluding earnings from disposition of non-strategic timberlands, Weyerhaeuser expects slightly higher earnings from the Timberlands segment in the
first
quarter. The company anticipates increased fee harvest volumes in the West and slightly improved average selling prices due to a higher percentage of export logs sold to Japan. Weyerhaeuser also anticipates higher fuel costs and seasonally higher silviculture expenses.
WOOD PRODUCTS
 
4Q 2011
Performance -
Results from continuing operations declined
$18 million
compared with the third quarter. Selling prices and volumes were seasonally lower for most products. The segment reduced operating rates to match weaker market demand, resulting in higher per unit manufacturing costs.
Fourth
quarter includes special charges of
$19 million
for restructuring and asset impairments. Third quarter included special charges of
$46 million
related to restructuring, asset impairments, and sale of the hardwoods operations. Weyerhaeuser completed the sale of the hardwoods operations in the third quarter.
1Q 2012
Outlook -
Excluding special items, Weyerhaeuser anticipates a smaller loss from the Wood Products segment in the
first
quarter. The company expects slightly higher selling prices for lumber and oriented strand board and increased sales volumes across all product lines. Unit manufacturing costs should decline due to seasonally improved operating rates.
CELLULOSE FIBERS
 
4Q 2011
Performance -
Fourth
quarter earnings declined
$1 million
compared with
third
quarter. Average selling prices for pulp declined throughout the fourth quarter. By the end of the quarter, commodity prices for Northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) pulp had fallen to levels last seen in the first quarter of 2010. The effect of the price decline was mostly offset by increased sales volumes. There were no annual maintenance outages in the third or fourth quarter.
1Q 2012
Outlook -
Weyerhaeuser expects substantially lower earnings from the Cellulose Fibers segment in the
first
quarter. The company anticipates considerably lower average selling prices for pulp and significantly higher maintenance costs due scheduled annual maintenance outages. Weyerhaeuser expects seasonally higher energy costs and increased fiber and chemical costs.
REAL ESTATE
 
4Q 2011
Performance -
Earnings increased
$31 million
compared with the
third
quarter. Home closings increased 15 percent to
582
single-family homes. Average margins on homes closed improved due to mix. Fourth quarter includes earnings of $19 million from the sale of land and lots. There were no significant earnings from land and lot sales in the third quarter.
1Q 2012
Outlook -
Weyerhaeuser anticipates a loss from single-family homebuilding operations in the
first
quarter. The company expects a seasonal decline in home closing volume and lower average margins due to mix.
CORPORATE AND OTHER
 
Corporate and Other results from continuing operations declined
$6 million
compared with the third quarter, as gains on foreign exchange were more than offset by increased charges for share-based compensation and other items.
Third quarter results included pre-tax gains of
$58 million
from special items, primarily the sale of Westwood Shipping Lines.
