Weyerhaeuser Reports
First
Quarter Results
FEDERAL WAY, Wash.
(
Apr 27, 2012
) - Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE: WY) today reported net earnings of
$41 million
for the
first
quarter, or
8 cents
per diluted share, on net sales of
$1.5 billion
. This compares with net earnings of
$99 million
on net sales from continuing operations of
$1.4 billion
for the same period last year.
Earnings for the
first
quarter of 2012 include after-tax gains of $32 million from special items. Excluding these items, the company reported net earnings of
$9 million
, or
2 cents
per diluted share. This compares with net earnings before special items of
$3 million
, or breakeven results per diluted share, in the
first
quarter of 2011.
"Even as indicators of a modestly improving U.S. housing market begin to emerge, we remain relentlessly focused on improving our financial performance," said Dan Fulton, president and chief executive officer. "We will take full advantage of recovering markets while positioning Weyerhaeuser for future growth, to the benefit of our shareholders."
 
TIMBERLANDS
 
1Q 2012
Performance -
The segment's results improved slightly compared with the
fourth
quarter. Income from operations increased $13 million, primarily due to lower Western operating costs. This was mostly offset by a $12 million decline in earnings from the disposition of non-strategic timberlands. Fee harvest volumes increased.
2Q 2012
Outlook -
Weyerhaeuser expects modestly higher earnings from the Timberlands segment in the second quarter. The company expects higher log sales volumes and slightly improved domestic prices for Western logs, partially offset by an overall increase in fuel costs and seasonally higher silviculture expenses.
WOOD PRODUCTS
 
1Q 2012
Performance -
Results before special items improved
$39 million
compared with the fourth quarter. Sales volumes and prices were higher across all product lines, and operating rates improved. These factors were partially offset by increased freight expense.
2Q 2012
Outlook -
Weyerhaeuser anticipates approximately breakeven results from the Wood Products segment in the second quarter. The company expects higher sales volumes across all product lines and improved selling prices for lumber.
CELLULOSE FIBERS
 
1Q 2012
Performance -
First
quarter earnings declined
$90 million
compared with
fourth
quarter. Average selling prices for pulp were lower, and sales volumes decreased. Maintenance costs increased significantly and production declined as the segment completed two planned annual maintenance outages in the first quarter. There were no annual maintenance outages in the fourth quarter.
2Q 2012
Outlook -
Weyerhaeuser expects slightly higher earnings from the Cellulose Fibers segment in the second quarter due to improved selling prices for pulp, partly offset by higher planned annual maintenance expense.
REAL ESTATE
 
1Q 2012
Performance -
The segment's earnings declined
$49 million
compared with the
fourth
quarter. Home closings declined seasonally to
349
single-family homes, and average margins on homes closed fell 8 percentage points due to mix. First quarter results include earnings of $1 million from lot sales, compared with $19 million from the sale of land and lots in the fourth quarter.
At the end of the first quarter the backlog of homes sold, but not closed, totaled 777 units, a 27 percent increase compared with one year ago.
2Q 2012
Outlook -
Weyerhaeuser expects a slight profit from the Real Estate segment in the second quarter. A land sale completed in April 2012 will contribute approximately $10 million to earnings. The company anticipates a small loss from single family homebuilding operations. Home closings should increase seasonally.
OTHER ITEMS
 
First quarter Unallocated Items include net pre-tax gains of $38 million from special items, comprised of a gain of
$52 million
from postretirement plan amendments and charges of
$14 million
for impairments, restructuring and other items.
First quarter special items also include a benefit of $8 million for income tax settlements.
