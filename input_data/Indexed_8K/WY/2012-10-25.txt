Weyerhaeuser Reports
Third
Quarter Results
FEDERAL WAY, Wash.
(
Oct 26, 2012
) - Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE: WY) today reported net earnings of
$117 million
, or
22 cents
per diluted share, for the
third
quarter. This compares with net earnings of
$157 million
, or
29 cents
per diluted share, and net earnings before special items of
$66 million
, or
12 cents
per diluted share, for the same period last year. Net sales for the third quarter of 2012 totaled
$1.8 billion
, compared with net sales from continuing operations of
$1.6 billion
for the third quarter of 2011.
"This month the Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 13 percent to 17 cents per share," said Dan Fulton, president and chief executive officer. "As our third quarter performance indicates, the operational improvements within our businesses are demonstrating clear results, and we are capitalizing on an improving housing market to the benefit of our shareholders."
 
TIMBERLANDS
 
3Q 2012
Performance -
The segment's
earnings improved
$3 million
compared with the
second
quarter. Earnings from disposition of non-strategic timberlands increased $18 million. This was mostly offset by lower domestic selling prices for Western logs, and reduced export log realizations due to mix. Western fee harvest volumes declined slightly, and road costs increased seasonally. In the South, average selling prices for logs improved slightly compared with the second quarter, and fee harvest volumes were slightly higher.
4Q 2012
Outlook -
Weyerhaeuser expects comparable earnings from the Timberlands segment in the fourth quarter. The company expects seasonally higher fee harvest volumes and slightly improved selling prices for Western logs in export and domestic markets, offset by increased silviculture costs.
WOOD PRODUCTS
 
3Q 2012
Performance -
The segment's earnings before special items improved
$29 million
compared with the
second
quarter due to strong markets and effective execution of performance improvement initiatives. Sales realizations were higher across nearly all product lines, most significantly in oriented strand board, which increased 25 percent. Sales volumes for engineered wood products increased, and volumes for lumber and oriented strand board declined slightly.
4Q 2012
Outlook -
Weyerhaeuser anticipates lower earnings from the Wood Products segment in the fourth quarter due to seasonal declines in pricing and demand for most products.
CELLULOSE FIBERS
 
3Q 2012
Performance -
The segment's earnings improved
$42 million
compared with the second quarter due to significantly lower maintenance costs, increased production and strong operating performance. Average pulp prices were flat. The segment completed one scheduled annual maintenance outage in the third quarter, compared with two in the second quarter.
4Q 2012
Outlook -
Weyerhaeuser expects earnings from the Cellulose Fibers segment to be comparable to the third quarter. The company anticipates lower selling prices for fluff pulp, offset by increased sales volumes and slightly lower maintenance expense.
REAL ESTATE
 
3Q 2012
Performance -
The segment's earnings improved
$2 million
. Third quarter included earnings of $17 million from single-family homebuilding, compared with $3 million from single-family homebuilding and $12 million from sale of land and lots in the
second
quarter. Home closings increased seasonally to
615
single-family homes, and average margins on homes closed were substantially higher due to mix.
At the end of the third quarter the backlog of homes sold, but not closed, totaled
1,055
units, a 74 percent increase compared with one year ago.
4Q 2012
Outlook -
Excluding any earnings from potential land sales, Weyerhaeuser expects slightly lower earnings from single-family homebuilding operations in the fourth quarter. The company anticipates a seasonal increase in home closings, lower average margins due to mix and higher selling expenses due to the additional closing volume.
