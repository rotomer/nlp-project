Information Statement
Separation and Distribution Agreement
On July 27, 2006, Wyndham entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement that sets forth the agreements among Wyndham, Cendant, Realogy and Travelport regarding the principal transactions necessary to effect the separation of Wyndham from Cendant. It also sets forth other agreements that govern certain aspects of Wyndham's ongoing relationships with Cendant, Wyndham and Travelport after the completion of the separation of Wyndham. A copy of the Separation and Distribution Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated by reference into this item.
Transition Services Agreement
On July 27, 2006, Wyndham entered into a Transition Services Agreement with Cendant, Wyndham and Travelport to provide Wyndham, Realogy and Travelport with an orderly transition to being independent from Cendant. Under the Transition Services Agreement, Wyndham will provide Cendant, Realogy and Travelport with various services, including services relating to human resources and employee benefits, payroll, financial systems management, treasury and cash management, accounts payable services, telecommunications services and information technology services. Under the Transition Services Agreement, Wyndham will also receive services from Cendant, Realogy and Travelport. A copy of the Transition Services Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference into this item.
Tax Sharing Agreement
On July 28, 2006, Wyndham entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement with Cendant, Realogy and Travelport that governs the parties' respective rights, responsibilities and obligations after the separation of Wyndham from Cendant with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of any distribution of all of the stock of Wyndham or Realogy (or Travelport if the sale of Travelport is not completed and the common stock of Travelport is distributed) to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. A copy of the Tax Sharing Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated by reference into this item.
2006 Awards
As previously disclosed in our Information Statement, the Company granted awards in respect of the 2006 Long Term Incentive Program to our employees, including the named executive officers, with a grant date of August 1, 2006. The terms of these award are subject to the terms and conditions of our
 
previously filed 2006 Equity and Incentive Plan and the form of the applicable award agreements, attached hereto as Exhibits 10.3 and 10.4, which are incorporated by reference into this item.
 
Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, on July 27, 2006, Wyndham drew approximately $300 million under its term loan facility and approximately $260 million under its $900 million revolving credit facility pursuant to its $1,200 million credit facility entered into on July 7, 2006 (the agreement pursuant to which such facility was entered into is referred to herein as the ""). Wyndham also drew approximately $800 million pursuant to its $800 million interim loan facility entered into on July 7, 2006 (the agreement pursuant to which such facility was entered into is referred to herein as the ""). On July 27, 2006, Wyndham used the proceeds drawn under the Credit Agreement and the Interim Loan Agreement to fund the transfer of approximately $1,360 million to Cendant solely for the purpose of repaying certain indebtedness of Cendant.
Credit Agreement
Interim Loan Agreement
Certain important features of the Credit Agreement and the Interim Loan Agreement are described in the section entitled "Description of Material Indebtedness" in Wyndham's Information Statement, which is incorporated by reference into this item. In addition, the Credit Agreement and the Interim Loan Agreement were attached as Exhibits 10.38 and 10.39, respectively, to Wyndham's Registration Statement on Form 10, as amended, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 12, 2006 and are incorporated by reference into this item.
As previously announced, upon the completion of a sale of Travelport by Cendant, Cendant will be required to promptly contribute a significant amount of the proceeds (after taxes, fees and expenses and retirement of Travelport's borrowings) to Wyndham and Realogy in order to reduce Wyndham's and Realogy's initial indebtedness. As discussed more fully in Wyndham's Information Statement, based on the expected amount of proceeds from the Travelport sale, it is currently estimated that Wyndham's debt level will be reduced from $1,360 million at the time of its separation from Cendant to approximately $600 million after the receipt of its share of Travelport proceeds. The actual amount of cash proceeds that Wyndham receives upon the sale of Travelport may be more or less than the amount estimated to received by Wyndham in the Information Statement (and as set forth above), such that Wyndham's indebtedness after giving effect to the receipt of such proceeds may be more or less than $600 million, depending on the adjustments to the purchase price at the closing of the Travelport sale, the amount of expenses, taxes and other payments incurred in connection with such sale, and the other uses of proceeds that have priority over contributions to Wyndham, in each case as more fully described in the section entitled "Certain Relationships and Related Party TransactionsSale of Travelport" in the Information Statement. In addition, it is expected that Wyndham will have approximately $120 million in cash and cash equivalents at the time of its separation from Cendant. There can be no assurance that the closing of the Travelport sale will occur or that if it does occur that Wyndham will receive the full amount of the cash proceeds it currently expects to receive.

Various factors that could affect our future results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements include but are not limited to:
