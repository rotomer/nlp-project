In connection with the distributions of all of the shares of common stock of Wyndham Worldwide Corporation ("") and Realogy Corporation to Cendant Corporation ("") stockholders, on July 31, 2006, the Compensation Committee of Cendant's Board of Directors approved a change to the date on which all Cendant equity awards (including Wyndham awards granted as an adjustment to such Cendant equity awards) will become fully vested. Such equity awards will now vest on August 15, 2006 rather than August 30, 2006 (which was the previous date upon which such equity awards were to vest). The foregoing will apply to current employees as of the date of the proposed vesting, as well as employees whose employment terminated in connection with Cendant's plan of separation.
