PARSIPPANY, N.J. (February 13, 2007)
Financial information discussed in this press release include both GAAP and non-GAAP measures, which include or exclude certain items, or reflect pro forma adjustments, related to the Company's spin-off effective July 31, 2006. These non-GAAP measures differ from reported results and are intended to illustrate what management believes are relevant period-over-period comparisons.

FOURTH QUARTER 2006 HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE:
"We finished the year with great momentum in each of our three businesses," said Stephen P. Holmes, Wyndham Worldwide chairman and chief executive officer. "We posted double-digit revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter of 2006. Our portfolio of diverse brands, locations and products gives us great financial stability, particularly since more than half of our revenue stems from fees related to services for consumers and business partners. Our strength in leisure accommodations allows us to capture share and expand our presence in a growing global travel industry."
Fourth Quarter 2006 Operating Results
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $970 million, up 13% over the same period in 2005, reflecting strong growth across the businesses. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $192 million,
 
excluding separation and related costs and the net benefit from the resolution of certain contingent liabilities, compared to $164 million for the fourth quarter of 2005. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $84 million or $0.44 per diluted earnings per share excluding:
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $92 million, compared to $91 million for the fourth quarter of 2005. Net income for 2005 excludes stand-alone corporate costs and interest expense associated with corporate debt since Wyndham Worldwide was a subsidiary of Cendant for all of 2005. Had Wyndham Worldwide been a stand-alone, public company during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to the fourth quarter of 2006, Adjusted net income would have increased 11% to $84 million from $76 million.
Lodging (Wyndham Hotel Group)
Lodging revenues increased 6% to $152 million for the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to $144 million for the fourth quarter of 2005. EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $47 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2006 increased 7% to $48 million (excluding separation and related costs of $1 million) compared to EBITDA for the prior year period of $45 million.
EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2006 includes incremental marketing expense of approximately $3 million associated with increasing Wyndham brand recognition.
RevPAR for the fourth quarter of 2006 increased 7% from the fourth quarter of 2005, excluding Wyndham and Baymont. Including these brands, fourth quarter 2006 RevPAR was $31.41, a 6% increase from the comparable prior year period.
At December 31, 2006, the Wyndham Hotel Group system consisted of nearly 6,500 properties with over 543,000 rooms, an increase of approximately 10,000 net rooms from the third quarter of 2006. The Company's hotel development pipeline as of December 31, 2006 included approximately 845 hotels and approximately 92,000 rooms, of which approximately 15% are international and approximately 45% are new construction.
Vacation Exchange and Rentals (RCI Global Vacation Network)
Vacation Exchange and Rentals revenues increased 13% to $266 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 from $235 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, reflecting continued momentum in transaction volume, pricing and members.
Vacation exchange revenues were $110 million, an 8% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. The average number of members as well as the annual dues and exchange revenue per member increased 5% and 3%, respectively, from the fourth quarter of 2005, reflecting new members, higher transaction volume and price increases implemented in the third quarter of 2006.
Vacation rentals revenues were $105 million, a 16% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2005, supported by improved inventory offerings, enhanced marketing and local economic conditions. Vacation rental transactions and average net price per vacation rentals increased 6% and 9%, respectively, from the fourth quarter of 2005.
Other ancillary revenues generated primarily from additional products and services provided to affiliates and members were $51 million in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Vacation Exchange and Rentals EBITDA grew to $59 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, a 28% increase compared to $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 which reflected a $14 million restructuring charge taken to combine our vacation exchange and vacation rentals operations. Absent that charge,
 
EBITDA was relatively flat due to continued investment during 2006 in new offerings to leverage our leading position in the growing leisure travel industry worldwide.
Vacation Ownership (Wyndham Vacation Ownership)
Gross Vacation Ownership Interest sales were $469 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, up more than 30% compared to the fourth quarter of 2005, driven by a 17% growth in tour flow and an 8% increase in volume per guest. The strong tour flow growth was the result of ongoing development of in-house sales programs, enhancements to local marketing efforts and continued industry demand.
Vacation Ownership fourth quarter 2006 revenues were $554 million and EBITDA was $89 million, including separation and related costs of $15 million. Excluding separation and related costs, Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2006 rose 18% compared to EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2005 of $88 million. These 2006 results reflect the adoption of SFAS No. 152, "Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions," which reduced comparative quarterly revenue by $63 million and increased EBITDA by $5 million.
Wyndham Vacation Ownership active development pipeline consists of approximately 3,900 units in 15 U.S. states, the Virgin Islands and 3 foreign countries. The Company expects the pipeline to support both new purchases of vacation ownership and upgrade sales to existing owners.
Full Year 2006 Operating Results
Revenues for full year 2006 were $3,842 million, up 11% compared to full year 2005, reflecting strong growth across all the businesses. Full year 2006 Adjusted EBITDA was $762 million, excluding separation and related costs and the net benefit from the resolution of certain contingent liabilities, but including pro forma incremental stand-alone corporate costs, a 9% increase over 2005 Adjusted EBITDA of $699 million. Full year EBITDA was $725 million compared to $751 million in the prior year period including separation and related costs and the net benefit from the resolution of certain contingent liabilities in 2006 and excluding pro forma incremental stand-alone corporate costs for both periods.
Adjusted net income for full year 2006 was $339 million, excluding the cumulative effect of SFAS No. 152, separation and related costs and the net benefit from the resolution of certain contingent liabilities, but including pro forma incremental stand-alone corporate costs. Income before the cumulative effect of SFAS No. 152 for full year 2006 was $352 million, compared to $431 million for full year 2005. Net income for 2005 excludes stand-alone corporate costs and interest expense associated with corporate debt since Wyndham Worldwide was a subsidiary of Cendant for all of 2005.
Full year 2006 highlights include:
Holmes continued: "2006 was a landmark year for Wyndham Worldwide. We exceeded our initial revenue guidance and hit our Adjusted EBITDA guidance, despite taking the previously reported second quarter 2006 $21 million tax accrual; excluding the accrual, we would have exceeded our Adjusted EBITDA guidance. These results would be commendable in any year, but are extraordinary in light of our corporate and operating initiatives this year: our transformation into an independent, publicly traded company, the integration of two hotel companies, and the re-branding of our vacation ownership business to Wyndham."

We are well-positioned to benefit from many consumer trends through our global reach, familiar brands and unparalleled scale. I am pleased with what we've accomplished, but, more importantly, with what we see in the future for Wyndham Worldwide."
