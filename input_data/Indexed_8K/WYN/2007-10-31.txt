Exhibit 99.1
 Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (NYSE:WYN) today announced results for the three months ended September 30, 2007.
PARSIPPANY, N.J. (October 31, 2007)
Financial information discussed in this press release includes both GAAP and non-GAAP measures, which include or exclude certain items, or reflect pro forma adjustments, related to the Company's spin-off effective July 31, 2006. These non-GAAP measures differ from reported results and are intended to illustrate what management believes are relevant period-over-period comparisons. Non-GAAP measures are indicated as "Adjusted." A complete reconciliation of reported GAAP results to the comparable Adjusted information appears in the financial tables section of this press release.
HIGHLIGHTS:
 
"Wyndham Worldwide continues to perform well despite the uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment, demonstrating our strong portfolio of brands and the resilience of our model, which is focused on the leisure traveler," said Stephen P. Holmes, Wyndham Worldwide chairman and chief executive officer. "Our businesses are positioned to take advantage of favorable demographics as the baby-boomer generation begins to retire and spends more time on leisure travel. We look forward to a strong finish in 2007 and continued growth in 2008."
The Company also announced that Kenneth N. May, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wyndham's Vacation Exchange and Rentals (Group RCI) business unit, will leave the Company effective November 2, 2007 to pursue new interests.
Mr. Holmes said, "Ken has been an integral part of shaping the vision for Group RCI, and I thank him for his many valuable contributions and wish him all the best. As we search for his successor, we will be looking at candidates who have strong and deep experience in global operations, relationship management, and online distribution and marketing, in order to best execute on that vision and drive results."
THIRD QUARTER 2007 OPERATING RESULTS
Revenues for the third quarter of 2007 were $1.2 billion, up 16% over the same period in 2006, reflecting strong organic growth.
Net income for the third quarter of 2007 was $117 million or $0.65 diluted earnings per share, compared to $92 million or $0.45 diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2006.
Net income for the third quarter of 2007 includes $2 million after-tax of separation and related costs associated with Wyndham Worldwide's spin-off from Cendant Corporation (now Avis Budget Group) and $15 million of an after-tax net charge from the resolution of and adjustments to certain legacy items primarily related to a previously disclosed increase in the legacy litigation reserve. Excluding these items, Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2007 was $134 million, or $0.75 diluted earnings per share.
Third quarter 2006 included $43 million after-tax of separation and related costs and a $15 million tax benefit related to refinements of the Company's 2005 state effective tax rates. Excluding these items and including $5 million after-tax of estimated incremental stand-alone costs (assuming Wyndham Worldwide had been a stand-alone, public company in July 2006), Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2006 was $115 million, or $0.56 diluted earnings per share.
BUSINESS UNIT RESULTS
Lodging (Wyndham Hotel Group)
Revenues increased 12% to $211 million in the third quarter of 2007 compared with the third quarter of 2006, reflecting increased property management reimbursable revenues and strong RevPAR gains both domestically and internationally. Comparable RevPAR increased 6.2% in the third quarter of 2007 and system-wide RevPAR increased 5.6% from the prior year period.
Property management reimbursable revenues were $26 million and marketing/reservation revenues, including TripRewards revenues, were $85 million; these items contribute little, if any, margin. Lodging
 
EBITDA grew to $70 million compared to $67 million in the third quarter of 2006, which included $1 million of separation and related costs.
As of September 30, 2007, the Company's hotel system consisted of 540,900 rooms and 6,460 properties with a development pipeline of over 104,000 rooms and approximately 940 hotels, of which 45% were new construction and 30% were international.
Vacation Exchange and Rentals (Group RCI)
Revenues increased to $336 million in the third quarter of 2007, an 8% increase compared with the third quarter of 2006, reflecting growth in both vacation exchange and vacation rentals as well as favorable currency translations. Excluding the favorable effect of currency translations of $14 million, revenues grew 4% compared to the third quarter of 2006.
Vacation exchange revenues were $116 million, a 4% increase compared to the third quarter of 2006, primarily driven by a 5% increase in the average number of members.
Vacation rentals revenues were $182 million, up 16% compared to the third quarter of 2006, or up 8% excluding the favorable effect of currency translations. These results reflected a 14% increase in the average net price per vacation rental and a 1% increase in rental transactions.
Other ancillary revenues generated primarily from additional products and services provided to affiliates and members were $38 million in the third quarter of 2007 compared with $40 million in the third quarter of 2006.
Third quarter 2007 EBITDA was $103 million, compared to third quarter 2006 EBITDA of $97 million, which included $1 million of separation and related costs. Excluding the favorable effect of currency translations of $7 million during 2007 and the separation and related costs during 2006, Adjusted EBITDA was down $2 million compared to the third quarter of 2006. Third quarter 2007 EBITDA included marginally higher costs consistent with increased rentals, severance expense, and incremental investment in information technology infrastructure.
Vacation Ownership (Wyndham Vacation Ownership)
Revenues increased 22% to $671 million in the third quarter of 2007 compared with the third quarter of 2006 reflecting continued success in marketing and sales.
Gross Vacation Ownership Interest sales were $552 million for the third quarter of 2007, up 15% compared to the third quarter of 2006, driven by marketing efforts resulting in 6% growth in tour flow and an 8% increase in volume per guest from strong performance by our sales force and continued strength in transaction pricing. Results continue to reflect the strength of our marketing, sales and new locations added in the second half of 2006.
Consumer finance revenues increased 21% for the third quarter of 2007 compared to the third quarter of 2006 reflecting continued Vacation Ownership sales growth.
EBITDA for the third quarter of 2007 increased 32% to $116 million, which includes $1 million of separation and related costs, compared to $88 million in the third quarter of 2006, which also included $1 million of separation and related costs. Third quarter 2007 EBITDA also reflects a $7 million pre-tax gain on the sale of certain vacation ownership properties that were no longer consistent with the Company's development plans.
On October 24, 2007, the Company priced a term securitization transaction involving the issuance of $455 million of insured investment grade asset-backed notes by Sierra Timeshare 2007-2 Receivables Funding, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of Wyndham Vacation Ownership. The notes are backed by
 
vacation ownership receivables originated by subsidiaries of Wyndham Vacation Ownership. The transaction is expected to close on or about November 1, 2007.
Other Items
Interest expense for the third quarter of 2007 was $20 million, an increase of $3 million from the third quarter of 2006. This increase is primarily due to higher average borrowings primarily due to differences in the Company's capital structure since the spin-off. Interest income for the quarter was $4 million, a $1 million decrease from the third quarter of 2006, primarily due to differences in the Company's capital structure since the spin-off. Depreciation and amortization rose $6 million to $43 million.
Balance Sheet Information as of September 30, 2007:
A schedule of debt is included in the financial tables section of this press release.
Share Repurchase
The Company repurchased 560,000 shares of stock during the third quarter of 2007 at an average price of $31.08 and an additional 235,000 shares at an average price of $32.69 through October 30, 2007.
Outlook and Guidance
"We are confident, based on Wyndham Worldwide's third quarter performance, that 2007 full year results will be within the upper end of our plan of $4,340  $4,480 million in revenues and full year Adjusted EPS of $2.02  $2.13," said Mr. Holmes.
"We anticipate fourth quarter Adjusted EPS of $0.44  $0.46, excluding separation and related costs and legacy matters, based on weighted average shares of approximately 180 million." Mr. Holmes noted that the Company's expectations for the fourth quarter assumes approximately $25 million in deferred vacation ownership revenue, or $0.04 per share, that will be recognized in future quarters.
Looking ahead to 2008, management provided preliminary guidance for the full-year 2008:
Revenues of approximately $4.8  $4.9 billion EBITDA, excluding legacy matters, of approximately $920  $945 million.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, conveying management's expectations as to the future based on plans, estimates and projections at the time the Company makes the statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release include statements related to trends for the Company's revenues, earnings and related financial and operating measures, the number of hotels the Company intends to add in future periods and the closing of its term securitization transaction.
You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements include general economic conditions, the performance of the financial markets, the economic environment for the hospitality industry, the impact of war and terrorist activity, operating risks associated with the hotel, vacation exchange and rentals and vacation ownership businesses, as well as those in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 7, 2007. Except for the Company's ongoing obligations to disclose material information under the federal securities laws, it undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report events or to report the occurrence of unanticipated events.
It is not practical to provide a reconciliation of forecasted Adjusted EBITDA for the full years 2007 and 2008 to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income, because certain items cannot be reasonably estimated or predicted at this time. Any of those items could be significant to our financial results.
 
Table 1
In addition to other measures, management evaluates the operating results of each of its reportable segments based upon net revenues and "EBITDA," which is defined as net income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense (excluding interest on securitized vacation ownership debt), interest income, income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax, each of which is presented on the Company's Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income. The Company's presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.
The following tables summarize net revenues and EBITDA for reportable segments, as well as reconcile EBITDA to net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006:
