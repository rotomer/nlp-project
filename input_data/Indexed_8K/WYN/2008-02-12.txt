PARSIPPANY, N.J. (February 12, 2008)
Financial information discussed in this press release includes both GAAP and non-GAAP measures, which include or exclude certain items, or reflect pro forma adjustments, related to the Company's spin-off effective July 31, 2006. These non-GAAP measures differ from reported results and are intended to illustrate what management believes are relevant period-over-period comparisons. Non-GAAP measures are indicated as "Adjusted." A complete reconciliation of reported GAAP results to the comparable Adjusted information appears in the financial tables section of this press release.
FOURTH QUARTER AND 2007 HIGHLIGHTS:
 
"Wyndham Worldwide posted strong financial and operating results in 2007, concluding our first full year as a public company with double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth as each of our business units delivered within our expectations," said Stephen P. Holmes, Wyndham Worldwide chairman and chief executive officer. "Our company continues to benefit from a global portfolio of economically resilient businesses and brands and from our multiple revenue sources, with more than half of our revenue generated from fee-for-service businesses. We continue to believe that our business model solidly positions us for continued growth, even in what looks like a tougher economic environment in 2008."
FULL YEAR 2007 OPERATING RESULTS
Revenues for full year 2007 increased to $4.4 billion, up 13% over the same period in 2006, reflecting strong organic growth:
 
Net income for full year 2007 was $403 million or $2.20 diluted earnings per share, compared to 2006 net income of $287 million or $1.44 diluted earnings per share. Net income for 2007 includes $10 million after-tax of separation and related costs and $26 million in after-tax net benefit from the resolution of and adjustment to certain legacy items. Excluding these items, Adjusted net income for full year 2007 was $387 million or $2.12 diluted earnings per share, up 14% and 25%, respectively, from full year 2006. Adjusted net income for full year 2006 was $339 million, or $1.70 diluted earnings per share.
FOURTH QUARTER 2007 OPERATING RESULTS
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $1.0 billion, up 6% over the same period in 2006, reflecting continued organic growth.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $104 million or $0.58 diluted earnings per share, compared to $92 million or $0.48 diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2006.
Excluding $21 million in after-tax net benefit from the resolution of and adjustment to certain legacy items, primarily related to a previously disclosed litigation settlement agreement by our former parent company, Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $83 million, or $0.46 diluted earnings per share.
Excluding $22 million after-tax of separation and related costs and excluding $30 million in after-tax net benefit from the resolution of and adjustment to certain legacy items, Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $84 million, or $0.44 diluted earnings per share.
BUSINESS UNIT RESULTS
Lodging (Wyndham Hotel Group)
Revenues increased 16% to $176 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared with the fourth quarter of 2006, reflecting strong RevPAR gains and increased property management reimbursable revenues. Comparable RevPAR increased 5.9% in the fourth quarter of 2007 and system-wide RevPAR increased 5.3% over the prior year period. For the quarter, Days Inn and Super 8, which collectively represent almost 60% of the Company's U.S. lodging portfolio  continued to experience industry-leading
 
comparable RevPAR growth for their segments. The Company's top five international lodging markets, Canada, China, the U.K., Germany and Mexico, which collectively represent 75% of the Company's international lodging portfolio, enjoyed RevPAR growth of almost 19% in the fourth quarter.
Property management reimbursable revenues were $28 million and marketing/reservation revenues, including TripRewards revenues, were $65 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to $16 million and $61 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2006; these items contribute little, if any, margin.
Fourth quarter 2007 EBITDA grew to $49 million compared to $47 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 (which included $1 million of separation and related costs). The EBITDA growth was muted by the timing of approximately $5 million of incremental marketing expenses.
As of December 31, 2007, the Company's hotel system consisted of approximately 550,600 rooms and 6,540 properties, with a development pipeline of approximately 930 hotels and over 105,000 rooms, of which 44% were new construction and 32% were international.
Vacation Exchange and Rentals (Group RCI)
Revenues increased to $280 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, a 5% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2006, reflecting growth in both vacation exchange and vacation rentals, as well as favorable currency translations, partially offset by a decline in other ancillary revenue. Excluding the favorable effect of currency translations of $14 million, revenues were flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2006.
Vacation exchange revenues were $112 million, up 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2006, primarily driven by a 5% increase in the average number of members, partially offset by a 3% decrease in annual dues and exchange revenue per member primarily related to the timing and mix of exchange deposits.
Vacation rentals revenues were $125 million, a 20% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2006, or a 9% increase excluding the favorable effect of currency translations. These results reflect a 20% increase in the average net price per vacation rental, or 9% excluding favorable currency translations, primarily due to the mix of activity at premium locations and the conversion of existing Landal parks from franchised to managed properties.
Other ancillary revenues generated primarily from additional products and services provided to affiliates and members were $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared with $51 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, primarily due to the absence of $4 million of revenues recorded during the fourth quarter of 2006 relating to consulting activities in Asia Pacific and $3 million of other marketing program revenues.
 
Fourth quarter 2007 EBITDA was $56 million, compared to fourth quarter 2006 EBITDA of $59 million, dampened by the impact of the consulting activities mentioned above and other marketing revenues in the fourth quarter of 2006 that were not repeated in 2007.
Vacation Ownership (Wyndham Vacation Ownership)
Revenues increased 4% to $576 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to the fourth quarter of 2006, reflecting continued success in marketing and sales, incremental property management revenues and growing consumer finance revenues. Fourth quarter 2007 revenues included a $21 million reduction in revenues as a result of deferred vacation ownership revenue under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting compared with an $11 million reduction in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Gross Vacation Ownership Interest sales (which exclude the effect of deferred revenues) were $488 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, up 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2006, driven by marketing efforts resulting in increases in tour flow and volume per guest based on strong performance by our sales force and continued strength in transaction pricing.
Consumer finance revenues increased $17 million or 22% for the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to the fourth quarter of 2006, which was partially offset in EBITDA due to improved borrowing efficiency against vacation ownership receivables. This shifted approximately $4 million of what would have been interest expense below EBITDA into interest expense reflected within EBITDA.
EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2007 increased 11% to $99 million, compared to $89 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, which included $15 million of separation and related costs. Fourth quarter 2007 EBITDA reflects a net reduction of approximately $6 million due to the increase in deferred vacation ownership revenue compared with the fourth quarter of 2006.
By the end of the quarter, Wyndham Vacation Ownership had largely completed its program of rebranding its properties under the Wyndham flag.
Other Items
Corporate results were positively affected by lower legal fees and transition service expenses in fourth quarter 2007 compared to the prior year period. Interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $17 million, unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2006. Interest income for the quarter was $2 million, a $1 million decrease from the comparable prior year period. Depreciation and amortization rose $3 million to $44 million.
Balance Sheet Information as of December 31, 2007:
 
A schedule of debt is included in the financial tables section of this press release.
Share Repurchase
The Company repurchased 970,000 shares of stock during the fourth quarter of 2007 at an average price of $27.92. For full year 2007, the Company repurchased 14.8 million shares of stock at an average price of $34.32. At December 31, 2007, approximately $163 million remained under the Company's previously announced share repurchase program.
Through February 11, the Company repurchased an additional 473,000 shares of stock at an average price of $22.19 and had approximately $154 million remaining under the current share repurchase authorization.
Outlook and Guidance
Wyndham Worldwide affirms guidance as follows:
Full Year 2008:
First Quarter 2008:
All guidance excludes legacy items which may have a positive or negative impact on reported results.
 
"I am pleased with our performance in 2007 and believe we are well-positioned to generate substantial long-term value for our shareholders," said Mr. Holmes. "While we see no current evidence of a slowdown in our businesses, we are watching consumer sentiment and the overall economy very carefully. That said, we believe 2008 will be a year of opportunity for Wyndham Worldwide, in large part because of the resiliency and flexibility inherent in our business model. We believe that Wyndham Worldwide can successfully compete and perform even in a slowing macro-economic environment."
