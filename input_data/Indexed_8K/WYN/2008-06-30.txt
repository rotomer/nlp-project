Responsibility for Loan Administration
     The Servicer shall manage, administer, service and make collections on the Pledged Loans on behalf of the Trustee and Issuer. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to all other provisions hereof, the Trustee and the Issuer grant to the Servicer a limited power of attorney to execute and the Servicer is hereby authorized and empowered to so execute and deliver, on behalf of itself, the Issuer and the Trustee or any of them, any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation or of partial or full release or discharge and all other comparable instruments with respect to the Pledged Loans, any related Mortgages and the related Vacation Ownership Interests, but only to the extent deemed necessary by the Servicer.
     Each of the Trustee, the Issuer and the Collateral Agent, at the request of a Servicing Officer, shall furnish the Servicer with any documents in its possession reasonably requested or take any action reasonably requested, necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer to carry out its servicing and administrative duties hereunder (subject, in the case of requests for documents contained in any Loan Files, to the requirements of Section 6.1(l)).
     WCF is hereby appointed as the Servicer until such time as any Service Transfer shall be effected under Article XII.
 
     Section 7.2 .
Standard of Care
     In managing, administering, servicing and making collections on the Pledged Loans pursuant to this Indenture, the Servicer will exercise that degree of skill and care consistent with Customary Practices and the Credit Standards and Collection Policies.
     Section 7.3 .
Records
     The Servicer shall, during the period it is Servicer hereunder, maintain such books of account, computer data files and other records as will enable the Trustee to determine the status of each Pledged Loan and will enable such Loan to be serviced in accordance with the terms of this Indenture by a Successor Servicer following a Service Transfer.
     Section 7.4 .
Loan Schedule
     The Servicer shall at all times maintain the Loan Schedule and electronically provide to the Trustee, the Issuer, the Collateral Agent and the Custodian a current, complete copy of the Loan Schedule.

     Section 7.5 .
Enforcement
     (a) The Servicer will, consistent with Section 7.2, act with respect to the Pledged Loans in such manner as will maximize the receipt of Collections in respect of such Pledged Loans (including, to the extent necessary, instituting foreclosure proceedings against the Vacation Ownership Interest, if any, underlying a Pledged Loan or disposing of the underlying Vacation Ownership Interest, if any). The Servicer will diligently monitor the integration of the collection functions of WCF and WRDC and to the extent the Servicer detects any deterioration in collections or any increase in delinquencies or defaults or other factors which indicate or might indicate any deterioration in collections, the Servicer will use its best efforts to determine the source of the problem and will use its best efforts to remedy such problem.
     (b) The Servicer may sue to enforce or collect upon Pledged Loans, in its own name, if possible, or as agent for the Issuer. If the Servicer elects to commence a legal proceeding to enforce a Pledged Loan, the act of commencement shall be deemed to be an automatic assignment of the Pledged Loan to the Servicer for purposes of collection only. If, however, in any enforcement suit or legal proceeding it is held that the Servicer may not enforce a Pledged Loan on the grounds that it is not a real party in interest or a holder entitled to enforce the Pledged Loan, the Trustee on behalf of the Issuer shall, at the Servicer's expense, take such steps as the Servicer and the Trustee may mutually agree are necessary (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld) to enforce the Pledged Loan, including bringing suit in its name or the name of the Issuer. The Servicer shall provide to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred thereby.
     (c) The Servicer, upon notice to the Trustee, may grant to the Obligor on any Pledged Loan any rebate, refund or adjustment out of the appropriate Collection Account that the Servicer in good faith believes is required as a matter of law; that, on any Business Day on which such rebate, refund or adjustment is to be paid hereunder, such rebate, refund or
provided
 
adjustment shall only be paid to the extent of funds otherwise available for distribution from the Collection Account.
     (d) The Servicer will not extend, amend, waive or otherwise modify the terms of any Pledged Loan or permit the rescission or cancellation of any Pledged Loan, whether for any reason relating to a negative change in the related Obligor's creditworthiness or inability to make any payment under the Pledged Loan or otherwise, other than in accordance with Customary Practices.
     (e) The Servicer shall have discretion to sell the collateral which secures any Defaulted Loans free and clear of the Lien of this Indenture, in exchange for cash, in accordance with Customary Practices and Credit Standards and Collection Policies. All proceeds of any such sale of such collateral shall be deposited by the Servicer into the Collection Account.
     (f) The Servicer shall not sell any Defaulted Loan or any collateral securing a Defaulted Loan to any Seller or Originator except for an amount at least equal to the fair market value thereof.
     (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the Servicer shall have no obligation to, and shall not, foreclose on the collateral securing any Pledged Loan unless the proceeds from such foreclosure will be sufficient to cover the expenses of such foreclosure. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, proceeds from the foreclosure by the Servicer on the collateral securing any Pledged Loans shall first be applied by the Servicer to reimburse itself for the expenses of such foreclosure, and any remaining proceeds shall be deposited into the Collection Account.
     Section 7.6 .
Trustee and Collateral Agent to Cooperate
     Upon request of a Servicing Officer, the Trustee and the Collateral Agent shall perform such other acts as are reasonably requested by the Servicer (including without limitation the execution of documents) and otherwise cooperate with the Servicer in enforcement of the Trustee's rights and remedies with respect to Pledged Loans.

     (b) execute and deliver, on behalf of the Issuer, any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release or discharge, and all other comparable instruments, with respect to the Pledged Loans and, after the delinquency of any Pledged Loan and to the extent permitted under and in compliance with applicable law and regulations, to commence enforcement proceedings with respect to such Pledged Loan including without limitation the exercise of rights under any power-of-attorney granted in any Pledged Loan; and
 
     (c) make any filings, reports, notices, applications, registrations with, and to seek any consents or authorizations from the Securities and Exchange Commission and any state securities authority on behalf of the Issuer as may be necessary or advisable to comply with any federal or state securities or reporting requirements laws.
     Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder, the Trustee agrees that it shall promptly follow the instructions of the Servicer duly given to withdraw funds from the Accounts.
     Section 7.8 .
Servicing Compensation
     As compensation for its servicing activities hereunder the Servicer shall be entitled to receive the Monthly Servicer Fee.

Such Substitution Adjustment Amount shall be paid to the Trustee and treated as if it were a portion of the Release Price for the Defaulted Loan and included in Available Funds as such.
Substitution

Release of Defaulted Loans
 
documents, releases and instruments of transfer or assignment and take such other actions as shall reasonably be requested by the Issuer to effect the release of such Defaulted Loans and the related Transferred Assets pursuant to this Section 14.4.

The Collateral Agent and the Trustee shall execute and deliver such instruments of assignment, in each case without recourse, representation or warranty, as shall be reasonably requested by the Issuer to release the security interest of the Collateral Agent in the Collateral.
