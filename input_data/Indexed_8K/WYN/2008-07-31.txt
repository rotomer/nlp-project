PARSIPPANY, N.J. (July 31, 2008)
SECOND QUARTER 2008 HIGHLIGHTS:
 
"We delivered solid earnings this quarter despite a challenging global economic environment, reflecting the strength and resilience of our business model," said Stephen P. Holmes, Wyndham Worldwide chairman and chief executive officer. "While we continue to experience pressure in our industry, the diversity and flexibility of our business model allows us to tailor and execute on our sales and marketing initiatives to navigate this difficult environment. I remain confident in our growth prospects."
SECOND QUARTER 2008 OPERATING RESULTS
Revenues for the second quarter of 2008 were $1.1 billion, up 3% compared to the second quarter of 2007. The Company also reported EBITDA growth in each of its three business units during the second quarter of 2008, compared to the second quarter of 2007.
Net income for the second quarter of 2008 was $98 million or $0.55 diluted earnings per share, compared to $96 million or $0.52 diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2007.
Excluding $4 million in after-tax net benefit from the resolution of, and adjustment to, certain legacy items, adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2008 would have been $94 million, or $0.53 adjusted diluted earnings per share, an 8% increase compared to $89 million, or adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.49 in the second quarter of 2007. Adjusted net income in the second quarter of 2007 excluded $4 million in after-tax separation and related costs and $11 million in after-tax net benefit from the resolution of, and adjustment to, certain legacy items.
On May 1, 2008, the Company provided second quarter EPS guidance of $0.46-0.48, which assumed $25-$35 million in percentage-of-completion (POC) related deferred revenue. Actual results included $5 million in POC related deferred revenue.
BUSINESS UNIT RESULTS
Revenues increased 8% to $200 million in the second quarter of 2008 compared with the second quarter of 2007, reflecting higher international revenues, incremental property management reimbursable revenues and increased revenue generated by the Company's loyalty program.
Lodging (Wyndham Hotel Group)
System-wide RevPAR increased 1.4% in the second quarter of 2008, reflecting strong international growth of 15.2%, or 8.4% in constant currency, and a decline in domestic RevPAR of 3.7%. Comparable RevPAR increased 0.6% over the prior year period.
Property management reimbursable revenues were $26 million and marketing/reservation revenues, including Wyndham Rewards revenues, were $77 million in the second quarter of 2008, compared to $22 million and $75 million, respectively, in the second quarter of 2007; these items contribute little, if any, EBITDA.
 
Second quarter 2008 EBITDA grew to $62 million compared to $59 million in the second quarter of 2007.
As of June 30, 2008, the Company's hotel system consisted of approximately 6,560 properties and 551,500 rooms, of which 20% were international, with a development pipeline of approximately 930 hotels and approximately 109,000 rooms, of which 50% were new construction and over 40% were international.
Revenues increased to $314 million in the second quarter of 2008, a 9% increase compared with the second quarter of 2007, reflecting growth in the average number of members and an increase in the average net price per vacation rental, including favorable currency translations. In constant currency, revenues increased 4% compared to the second quarter of 2007.
Vacation Exchange and Rentals (Group RCI)
Vacation rentals revenues were $153 million, up 12% compared to the second quarter of 2007, or a 3% increase in constant currency. These results reflect a 15% increase in the average net price per vacation rental, or 5% in constant currency, primarily due to favorable mix, and the conversion of an existing Landal park from franchised to a managed property. The gains in the average net price per vacation rental were partially offset by a 2% decline in rental transaction volume which we believe is due to customers booking their vacations closer to the actual travel dates.
Annual dues and exchange revenues were $119 million, up 2% compared to the second quarter of 2007, or a 1% increase in constant currency. The increase was primarily driven by a 5% increase in the average number of members, partially offset by a 3% decrease in the average revenue per member.
Other ancillary revenues were $42 million, up 17% compared to the second quarter of 2007. The increase was primarily due to an adjustment recorded during the second quarter of 2007 that reduced Asia Pacific consulting revenue by $5 million and EBITDA by $6 million.
Second quarter 2008 EBITDA was $54 million, compared to second quarter 2007 EBITDA of $49 million. In constant currency, EBITDA increased $5 million compared to the second quarter of 2007.
Gross Vacation Ownership Interest sales were $532 million for the second quarter of 2008, up 2% compared to the second quarter of 2007. This increase was primarily driven by a 3% increase in tour flow.
Vacation Ownership (Wyndham Vacation Ownership)
Consumer finance revenues increased $16 million to $104 million in the second quarter of 2008, up 18% compared to the second quarter of 2007, reflecting continued growth in the portfolio due to higher gross VOI sales.
 
Reported revenues were $621 million in the second quarter of 2008, down 1% compared to the second quarter of 2007, reflecting a higher provision for loan losses. Deferred revenue under the POC method of accounting was $5 million during both the 2008 and 2007 periods.
EBITDA for the second quarter of 2008 was $112 million, compared to $100 million in the second quarter of 2007, which included $5 million of separation and related costs.
Interest expense for the second quarter of 2008 was $18 million, unchanged from the second quarter of 2007. Interest income for the quarter was $3 million, up $1 million from the comparable prior year period. Depreciation and amortization increased $5 million to $46 million reflecting increased capital investments over the past two years.
