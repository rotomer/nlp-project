Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
PARSIPPANY, N.J. (May 12, 2009)  Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (NYSE:WYN) today announced that it intends to offer senior unsecured notes and convertible notes to the public through underwritten offerings pursuant to its effective shelf registration statement. Both offerings are subject to market and other conditions and neither is contingent upon the other.
Wyndham Worldwide intends to offer senior unsecured notes due 2014.  The aggregate principal amount, interest rate and other financial terms of the notes will be determined upon pricing.  Wyndham Worldwide intends to use the net proceeds from the senior unsecured notes offering to reduce the principal balance outstanding under its revolving credit facility.
.  
Wyndham Worldwide
also
intends to offer
$200
million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due
2012
The
convertible
notes
will be settled in cash and
will not be convertible into shares of Wyndham Worldwide common stock or any other securities.  The interest rate, conversion rate and other financial terms of the
convertible
notes will be determined
upon
pricing.  Wyndham Worldwide also expects to grant the underwriters
for the offering
an option to purchase up to
an additional
$
30
million
aggregate
principal amount of
convertible
notes solely to cover over
-
allotments.
Wyndham Worldwide expects to enter into convertible note hedge transactions, which are expected to offset Wyndham Worldwide's exposure to any cash payments above par value that may be required upon conversion of any convertible notes.  Wyndham Worldwide also expects to enter into warrant transactions, which Wyndham Worldwide will have the option to settle in net shares or cash.  Both the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions will be entered into with affiliates of one or more of the underwriters. Wyndham Worldwide expects that the exercise price of the warrants will represent a substantial premium over the current market price of Wyndham Worldwide's common stock.  However, the warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect on Wyndham Worldwides earnings per share to the extent that the price of Wyndham Worldwides common stock exceeds the exercise price of the warrants.
Wyndham Worldwide will use a portion of the net proceeds from the convertible notes offering and the proceeds from the warrant transactions to enter into the convertible note hedge transactions.  Wyndham Worldwide intends to use the remainder of net proceeds from the convertible notes offering to reduce the principal balance outstanding under its revolving credit facility.  
If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option, Wyndham Worldwide will increase the size of the convertible note hedge transactions, and may sell additional warrants to the affiliates of the underwriters.
Wyndham Worldwide
has been advised by the affiliates of the underwriters
that they or their respective affiliates may enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Wyndham Worldwides common stock concurrently with or shortly following pricing of the convertible
 
 
 
notes.  These activities could have the effect of increasing, or preventing a decline in, the price of Wyndham Worldwides common stock concurrently with or following the pricing of such notes.
The offering of the
notes
and the convertible notes will be made only by means of written prospectuses.
