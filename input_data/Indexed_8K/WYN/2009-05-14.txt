Exhibit 99.1      Press Release of Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, dated May 13, 2009.
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
 
PARSIPPANY, N.J. (May 13, 2009)  Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (NYSE:WYN) today announced the pricing of $250 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2014 and $200 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2012.  In addition, Wyndham Worldwide has granted the underwriters an over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional $30 million principal amount of convertible notes. The senior unsecured notes offering is expected to close on May 18, 2009, and the convertible notes offering is expected to close on May 19, 2009.  Wyndham Worldwide intends to use the aggregate net proceeds from the offerings to reduce the principal balance outstanding under its revolving credit facility and to pay the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions, after giving effect to the proceeds to Wyndham Worldwide from the warrant transactions (each as described below).
The senior unsecured notes will bear interest at a rate of 9.875% per year payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing November 1, 2009. The notes will mature on May 1, 2014. The notes were offered to the public at a price of 95.801% of principal amount.
The convertible notes will bear interest at a rate of 3.50% per year payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing November 1, 2009.  The convertible notes will not be convertible into shares of Wyndham Worldwide common stock or any other securities under any circumstances.  Under certain circumstances and during certain periods, the convertible notes may be convertible into cash at an initial conversion rate of 78.5423 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $12.73 per share of Wyndham Worldwide common stock.  The conversion price represents a premium of approximately 20% to the closing price of Wyndham Worldwide's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on May 13, 2009.
Based on the terms of these transactions, Wyndham Worldwide estimates incremental interest expense in 2009 of approximately $25 million.
Upon pricing of the convertible notes, Wyndham Worldwide entered into (i) convertible note hedge transactions that are expected to offset its exposure to any cash payments above par value, that may be required upon conversion of any convertible notes, and (ii) warrant transactions, which Wyndham Worldwide will have the option to settle in net shares or cash.  The exercise price of the warrant transactions (approximately $20.16 per share) represents a premium of 90% over the closing price of Wyndham Worldwides common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on May 13, 2009.  The warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect on Wyndham Worldwide's earnings per share to the extent that the price of Wyndham Worldwide's common stock exceeds the exercise price of the warrants.  The convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions were entered into with affiliates of certain of the underwriters.  Wyndham Worldwide has been advised by the affiliates of the underwriters that they or their
 
 
respective affiliates may enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Wyndham Worldwides common stock concurrently with or shortly following pricing of the convertible notes.  These activities could have the effect of increasing, or preventing a decline in, the price of Wyndham Worldwides common stock concurrently with or following the pricing of such notes.
The offerings were made pursuant to Wyndham Worldwides effective registration statement only by means of written prospectuses.
