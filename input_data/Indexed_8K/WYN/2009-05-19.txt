Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On May 13, 2009, Wyndham Worldwide Corporation ("Wyndham Worldwide") entered into two underwriting agreements (each, an "Underwriting Agreement") for the issuance of (i) $250 million aggregate principal amount of 9.875% senior unsecured notes due 2014 (the "Senior Notes"),with Banc of America Securities LLC, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Citi Global Markets Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and the several underwriters named therein, and (ii) $230 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2012 (the "Convertible Notes," and together with the Senior Notes, the "Notes"), with Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Citi Global Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and the several underwriters named therein. Wyndham Worldwide issued the Senior Notes on May 18, 2009 and the Convertible Notes on May 19, 2009 pursuant to its effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-155676), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 25, 2008 (the "Registration Statement"). The terms of the Notes are governed by an indenture, dated November 20, 2008 between Wyndham Worldwide and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Base Indenture"), and, with respect to the Senior Notes, the first supplemental indenture thereto, dated May 18, 2009 and, with respect to the Convertible Notes, the second supplemental indenture thereto, dated May 19, 2009 (each, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture").
     The Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 9.875% per year payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing November 1, 2009. The interest rate payable on the Senior Notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if either Moody's Investor Service or Standard and Poor's, or, in either case, any substitute rating agency, downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the debt ratings assigned to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are redeemable at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the sum of the principal being redeemed, accrued and unpaid interest and a "make-whole" premium specified in the Senior Notes. If Wyndham Worldwide experiences a change of control, Wyndham Worldwide is required to offer to repurchase the Senior Notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.
     The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.50% per year payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing November 1, 2009. The Convertible Notes are not convertible into shares of Wyndham Worldwide common stock or any other securities under any circumstances. Under certain circumstances and during certain periods, the Convertible Notes may be converted into cash at an initial conversion rate of 78.5423 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $12.73 per share of Wyndham Worldwide common stock. The conversion price represented a premium of approximately 20% to the closing price of Wyndham Worldwide's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on May 13, 2009, the date of pricing.
     Wyndham Worldwide entered into (i) convertible note hedge transactions that are expected to offset its exposure to any cash payments above par value that may be required upon conversion of any Convertible Notes, and (ii) warrant transactions, which Wyndham Worldwide will have the option to settle in net shares or cash (the "Warrants"). The exercise price of the Warrants (approximately $20.16 per share) represented a premium of approximately 90% to the closing price of Wyndham Worldwide's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on May 13, 2009, the date of pricing.
     The Indentures contain customary provisions for events of default including for failure to pay principal or interest when due and payable, failure to comply with covenants or agreements in the Indentures or the Notes and failure to cure or obtain a waiver of such default upon notice, a default under other debt of Wyndham Worldwide or certain of its subsidiaries such that at least $50 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness is accelerated which acceleration has not been rescinded or annulled within 30 days of notice, and events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization affecting Wyndham Worldwide and certain of its subsidiaries. In the case of an event of default, the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest may be accelerated.
     The description of the Notes and the Indentures in this report are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by the terms of the Indentures and the forms of the Notes included therein. The Base Indenture was filed with the SEC as Exhibit 4.2 to the Registration Statement. The Underwriting Agreements, first and second supplemental indentures, the forms of Senior Notes and Convertible Notes, and each hedge and warrant transaction agreement are filed as exhibits hereto and are incorporated by reference herein.

The Company has not knowingly granted, and there is no and has been no policy or practice of the Company of granting, Stock Options prior to, or otherwise coordinate the grant of Stock Options with, the release or other public announcement of material information regarding the Company or its subsidiaries or their results of operations or prospects.

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has been named as a "potentially responsible party" under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended.

the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.

This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting", (ii) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (iii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances, (iv) the paragraph related to

The indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense of any such action and appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel, other than local counsel if not appointed by the indemnifying party, retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party.

An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

     (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, damage, liability or action) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each officer and director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).

          9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the

Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
          Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell to the several underwriters named in Schedule II hereto (the "Underwriters"), for whom you (the "Representatives") are acting as representatives, the principal amount of its 3.50% Convertible Notes due 2012 identified in Schedule I hereto (the "Underwritten Securities"). The Company also proposes to grant to the Underwriters an option purchase up to an additional principal amount of securities set forth in Schedule I hereto to cover over-allotments (the "Option Securities"; the Option Securities, together with the Underwritten Securities, hereinafter called the "Securities"). The Securities are not convertible into shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), of the Company or any other securities of the Company under any circumstances. Upon conversion, in lieu of receiving shares of Common Stock, a holder of the Securities will receive an amount in cash equal to the settlement amount, determined in the manner set forth in the Final Prospectus. The Securities are to be issued under an indenture (the "Base Indenture") dated as of November 20, 2008, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee") and a first supplemental indenture between the Company and the Trustee to be dated the Closing Date (together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"). To the extent there are no additional Underwriters listed on Schedule II other than you, the term Representatives as used herein shall mean you, as Underwriters, and the terms Representatives and Underwriters shall mean either the singular or plural as the context requires. The use of neuter in this Agreement shall include the feminine and masculine wherever appropriate. Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Exchange Act on or before the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference herein to the terms
 
"amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated therein by reference. Certain terms used herein are defined in Section 20 hereof.

The Company may have filed with the Commission, as part of an amendment to the Registration Statement or pursuant to Rule 424(b), one or more preliminary prospectus supplements relating to the Securities, each of which has previously been furnished to you. The Company will file with the Commission a final prospectus supplement relating to the Securities in accordance with Rule 424(b). As filed, such final prospectus supplement shall contain all information required by the Act and the rules thereunder, and, except to the extent the Representatives shall agree in writing to a modification, shall be in all substantive respects in the form furnished to you prior to the Execution Time or, to the extent not completed at the Execution Time, shall contain only such specific additional information and other changes (beyond that contained in the Base Prospectus and any Preliminary Prospectus) as the Company has advised you, prior to the Execution Time, will be included or made therein. The Registration Statement, at the Execution Time, meets the requirements set forth in Rule 415(a)(1)(x). The initial Effective Date of the Registration Statement was not earlier than the date three years before the Execution Time.
     (b) On each Effective Date, the Registration Statement did, and when the Final Prospectus is first filed in accordance with Rule 424(b) and on the Closing Date (as defined herein) and on any date on which Option Securities are purchased, if such date is not the Closing Date (a "settlement date"), the Final Prospectus (and any supplement thereto) will, comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act, the Exchange Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the respective rules thereunder; on each Effective Date and at the Execution Time, the Registration Statement did not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; on each Effective Date and on the Closing Date the Indenture did or will comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Trust Indenture Act and the rules thereunder; and on the date of any filing pursuant to Rule 424(b) and on the Closing Date and any settlement date, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
 
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; , , that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to (i) that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee or (ii) the information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus (or any supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus (or any supplement thereto), it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 8(b) hereof.

The preceding sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from the Disclosure Package based upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 8(b) hereof.
     (d) (i) At the time of filing the Registration Statement, (ii) at the time of the most recent amendment thereto for the purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or form of prospectus), and (iii) at the Execution Time (with such date being used as the determination date for purposes of this clause (iii)), the Company was or is (as the case may be) a "well-known seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405. The Company agrees to pay the fees required by the Commission relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1)(i) without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r).

     (i) The statements in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus under the captions "Description of Notes," "Description of Cash Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions" and "Description of Debt Securities," insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the Indenture and the Securities, fairly summarize such provisions in all material respects.

earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business (a "Material Adverse Effect").
     (n) All the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company and each Significant Subsidiary have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable.

     (aa) Each Franchisee is such by virtue of being a party to a franchise contract with either the Company or a subsidiary thereof and assuming each such contract has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto, other than the Company or a subsidiary thereof, each such contract constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of each party thereto, enforceable against the Company or a subsidiary thereof in accordance with its terms, except (i) for any one or more of such franchise contracts as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, and (ii) to the extent that enforcement thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including,
 
without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except as enforcement thereof is subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

     (dd) The Company and each of its subsidiaries are insured by insurers of recognized financial responsibility against such losses and risks and in such amounts as are prudent and customary in the businesses in which they are engaged; all policies of insurance and fidelity or surety bonds insuring the Company or any of its subsidiaries or their respective businesses, assets, employees, officers and directors are to the knowledge of the Company in full force and effect; the Company and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of such policies and instruments; and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to continue its business at a cost that would not have a Material Adverse Effect except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto made after the date hereof).
     (ee) The Company and its subsidiaries possess all governmental licenses, certificates, permits and other authorizations issued by all applicable governmental authorities necessary to conduct their respective businesses, except where failure to possess would not have a Material Adverse Effect, and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any such certificate, authorization or permit which, individually or in the aggregate, if the subject of an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, would have a Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto made after the date hereof).

The Company and its subsidiaries are not aware of any material weakness in their internal control over financial reporting. The Company and its subsidiaries maintain adequate "disclosure controls and procedures" (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15e under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
     (gg) Except as described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, with respect to the stock options (the "Stock Options") granted pursuant to the stock-based compensation plans of the Company and its subsidiaries (the "Company Stock Plans"), (i) each Stock Option designated by the Company at the time of grant as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code so qualifies, (ii) each grant of a Stock Option was duly authorized no later than the date on which the grant of such Stock Option was by its terms to be effective (the "Grant Date") by all necessary corporate action, including, as applicable, approval by the board of directors of the Company (or a duly constituted and authorized committee thereof) and any required stockholder approval by the necessary number of votes or written consents, and the award agreement governing such grant (if any) was duly executed and delivered by each party thereto, (iii) each such grant was made in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Plans, the Exchange Act and all other applicable laws and regulatory rules or requirements, including the rules of the New York Stock Exchange and any other exchange on which Company securities are traded, (iv) the per share exercise price of each Stock Option was no less than the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the applicable Grant Date and (v) each such grant was properly accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States in the financial statements (including the related notes) of the Company and disclosed in the Company's filings with the Commission in accordance with the Exchange Act and all other applicable laws. The Company has not knowingly granted, and there is no and has been no policy or practice of the Company of granting, Stock Options prior to, or otherwise coordinate the grant of Stock Options with, the release or other public announcement of material information regarding the Company or its subsidiaries or their results of operations or prospects.

liability would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto made after the date hereof). Except as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has been named as a "potentially responsible party" under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended.
     (ii)  In the ordinary course of its business, the Company periodically reviews the effect of Environmental Laws on the business, operations and properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, in the course of which it identifies and evaluates associated costs and liabilities (including, without limitation, any capital or operating expenditures required for clean-up, closure of properties or compliance with Environmental Laws, or any permit, license or approval, any related constraints on operating activities and any potential liabilities to third parties); on the basis of such review, the Company has reasonably concluded that such associated costs and liabilities would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto made after the date hereof).

     (kk) None of the following events has occurred or exists: (i) a failure to fulfill the obligations, if any, under the minimum funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA, and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder with respect to a Plan, determined without regard to any waiver of such obligations or extension of any amortization period; (ii) an audit or, to the knowledge of the Company, investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other federal or state governmental agency or any foreign regulatory agency with respect to the employment or compensation of employees by any of the Company or any of its subsidiaries that could have a Material Adverse Effect; or

any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.
     (h) The Company agrees that, unless it has or shall have obtained the prior written consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company that, unless it has or shall have obtained, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433, other than a free writing prospectus containing the information contained in the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto; provided that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule III hereto and any electronic road show.

     (c) The Representatives shall have received from Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
 
     (d) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by and in their capacity as such (x) the Chairman of the Board or the President and (y) the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have reviewed the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus and any supplements or amendments thereto, as well as each electronic road show used in connection with the offering of the Securities, and this Agreement and that:
     (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date;
     (ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice objecting to its use has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and
     (iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has been no material adverse effect, and no development involving a prospective change which would have a material adverse effect, on the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
     (e) At the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, the Company shall have requested and caused Deloitte & Touche LLP to furnish to the Representatives letters, dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in the form attached as Exhibit C hereto confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Exchange Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder. References therein to the Final Prospectus shall also include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter.
     (f) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Disclosure Package (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), as the case may be, there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (e) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto) the effect of which, in any case
 
referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of supplement thereto).
     (g) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.

Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
          The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 shall be delivered at the office of Davis Polk & Wardwell counsel for the Underwriters, at 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017, on the Closing Date.
          7. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC on demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
     8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or
Indemnification and Contribution
 
otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Final Prospectus, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, and with respect to such prospectuses in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
     (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of or are based upon any untrue statements or omission made in written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting", (ii) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (iii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances, (iv) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and (v) the paragraph with respect to compliance with Rule 5110(h) of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a)
 
or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise have knowledge of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense of any such action and appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel, other than local counsel if not appointed by the indemnifying party, retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel (including local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
provided
however
     (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, damage, liability or action) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting
provided
however
 
discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each officer and director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
          9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing
Default by an Underwriter

          10. .

Termination
     (b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party, except to the extent provided in Section 5(k) and Section 7 herein. Notwithstanding any such termination, the provisions of Section 8 and Section 11 shall remain in effect.
          11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

Section 2.16(f)
          (g) For so long as only one of Moody's or S&P provides a rating of the Notes and no Substitute Rating Agency is offered to replace the other rating agency, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Notes necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the agency providing the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table set forth in subsection (b) or (c) of this . For so long as none of Moody's, S&P or a Substitute Rating Agency provides a rating of the Notes, the interest rate on the Notes shall increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% greater than the interest rate payable on the Notes on the date of their issuance. If Moody's or S&P either ceases to rate the Notes for reasons within the control of the Company or ceases to make a rating of the Notes publicly available for reasons within the control of the Company, the Company shall not be entitled to obtain a rating from a Substitute Rating Agency and the increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Notes shall be determined in the manner described in this as if either only one or no rating agency provides a rating of the Notes, as the case may be.

          "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date:
          (a) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or
          (b) if the Independent Investment Banker is unable to obtain at least four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations obtained by the Independent Investment Banker or, if the Independent Investment Banker is able to obtain only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation, such Reference Treasure Dealer Quotation.

          Notice of any redemption shall be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each registered Holder of the Securities to be redeemed.

If fewer than all of the Securities are to be redeemed, and such Securities are at the time represented by a Global Security, the Depositary shall select by lot the particular interests to be redeemed. If the Company elects to redeem fewer than all of the Securities, and any of such Securities are not represented by a Global Security, then the Trustee shall select the particular Securities to be redeemed in a manner it deems appropriate and fair (and the Depositary shall select by lot the particular interests in any Global Security to be redeemed).
          The Company may at any time, and from time to time, purchase the Securities at any price or prices in the open market or otherwise.

Amendment, Modification and Waiver
          . The Indenture does not limit the incurrence of additional debt by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; however, it does limit the creation of certain Liens and the entry into sale and leaseback transactions by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

     (c) Each Conversion Notice shall state the name or names (with address or addresses) in which any certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock which shall be issuable on such conversion shall be issued. All such Notes surrendered for conversion shall, unless the shares issuable on conversion are to be issued in the same name as the registration of such Notes, be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed by, the Holder or his duly authorized attorney.
     (d) In case any Notes of a denomination greater than $2,000 shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of the Notes so surrendered, without charge, new Notes in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Notes.

. Exchange in Lieu of Conversion.
     (a) When a Holder surrenders its Notes for conversion, the Company may, at its election (an ""), direct the Conversion Agent to surrender, on or prior to the second Business Day following the Conversion Date, such Notes to a financial institution designated by the Company (the "") for exchange in lieu of conversion. In order to accept any Notes surrendered for conversion, the Designated Financial Institution must agree to timely pay, in exchange for such Notes (together with such Holder's Conversion Notice and, if required, appropriate endorsements and transfer documents), the cash that would otherwise be due upon conversion pursuant to Section 4.01 (the "") and in respect of which the Company has notified converting Holders.

     (b) Subject to the immediately following sentence, any Notes exchanged by the Designated Financial Institution will remain outstanding. If the Designated Financial Institution agrees to accept any Notes for exchange but does not timely deliver the cash due upon conversion, or if such Designated Financial Institution does not accept the Notes for exchange, the Company will deliver the cash due upon conversion as if the Company had not made an Exchange Election.
     (c) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the Company's designation of a Designated Financial Institution pursuant to this Section 4.04 require the Designated Financial Institution to accept any Notes for exchange.
     SECTION 4.05The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company if any of the following events occurs, except that the Company will not make any adjustment to the Conversion Rate if Holders of Notes participate, at the same time as holders of Common Stock and as a result of holding the Notes, in any of the transactions described in this Section 4.04, at the same time as holders of the Common Stock participate, without having to convert their Notes as if such Holders held the full number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of the Conversion Rate and the applicable principal amount of such Holders' Notes.
. Adjustment of Conversion Rate.
     (a) If the Company, at any time or from time to time while any of the Notes are outstanding, exclusively issues shares of its Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of Common Stock, or if the Company effects a share split or share combination, then the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
     where
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the Opening of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution, or the effective date for such share split or share combination. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 4.05(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
     (b) If the Company, at any time or from time to time while any of the Notes are outstanding, issues to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock any rights or warrants entitling them for a period of not more than 45 calendar days after the announcement date of such issuance to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock at a price per share less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
     where
To the extent such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration or termination, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate which would be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. In the event that such rights or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants had not been fixed. For the purposes of this Section 4.05(b), in determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to
 
subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, and in determining the aggregate exercise price payable for such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights or warrants and any amount payable on exercise thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, as shall be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.
     (c) If the Company, at any time or from time to time while the Notes are outstanding, distributes shares of any class of Capital Stock of the Company, evidences of its indebtedness, other assets or property of the Company or rights or warrants to acquire the Company's Capital Stock or other securities to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, excluding:
     (i) dividends or distributions and rights or warrants as to which an adjustment was effected pursuant to Section 4.05(a) or Section 4.05(b);
     (ii) Spin-Offs to which the provisions set forth below in this Section 4.05(c) shall apply; and
     (iii) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash;
then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
     where
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the Opening of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. If the Board of Directors determines the "FMV" (as defined
 
above) of any distribution for purposes of this Section 4.05(c) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock.
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 4.05(c) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit (a ""), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
     where
The adjustment to the Conversion Rate under the preceding paragraph will occur immediately after the end of the Valuation Period; that in respect of any conversion during the Valuation Period, references above to ten Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the Ex-Dividend Date of such Spin-Off and the Conversion Date in determining the applicable Conversion Rate.
provided
     For the purposes of this Section 4.04(c) (and subject in all respects to Section 4.11), rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of its Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's Capital Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (a ""): (1) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (2) are not exercisable; and (3) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 4.04(c), (and no
Trigger Event
 
adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 4.04(c) will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 4.04(c). If any such right or warrant, including any such existing rights or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Supplemental Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Ex-Dividend Date of such deemed distribution (in which case the original rights or warrants shall be deemed to terminate and expire on such date without exercise by any of the holders). In addition, in the event of any distribution or deemed distribution of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 4.04(c) was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants which shall all have been redeemed or purchased without exercise by any Holders thereof, upon such final redemption or repurchase (x) the Conversion Rate shall readjusted as if such rights or warrants had not been issued and (y) the Conversion Rate shall then again be readjusted to give effect to such distribution, deemed distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or purchase price received by holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming each such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or purchase, and (2) in the case of such rights or warrants which shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had not been issued.
     For the purposes of this Section 4.04(c) and subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 4.04, any dividend or distribution to which this Section 4.04(c) applies which also includes one or both of:
then (1) such dividend or distribution, other than the Clause A Distribution and the Clause B Distribution, shall be deemed to be a dividend or distribution to which this Section 4.04(c) applies (the "") and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 4.04(c) with respect thereto shall then be made, and (2) the Clause A Distribution and Clause B Distribution shall be deemed to immediately follow the Clause C Distribution and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 4.04(a) and Section 4.04(b) with respect thereto shall then be made, except, if determined by the Company, (I) the "Ex-Dividend Date" of the Clause A Distribution and the Clause B Distribution shall be deemed to be the Ex-Dividend Date of the Clause C Distribution and (II) any shares of Common Stock included in the Clause A Distribution or Clause B Distribution shall be deemed not to be "outstanding immediately prior
Clause C Distribution
 
to the Opening of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date or such effective date" within the meaning of Section 4.04(a) or "outstanding immediately prior to the Opening of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date" within the meaning of Section 4.04(b).
     (d) If any cash dividend or distribution is made to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, other than a regular, quarterly cash dividend that does not exceed $0.04 (the ""), the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Initial Dividend Threshold
     where
If the dividend or distribution is not a regular, quarterly cash dividend, the Initial Dividend Threshold will be deemed to be zero. The Initial Dividend Threshold shall be adjusted in a manner inversely proportional to adjustments to the Conversion Rate; that no adjustment shall be made to the Initial Dividend Threshold for any adjustment made to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 4.05(d).
provided
In the case of an adjustment pursuant to this Section 4.05(d), such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the Opening of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for the relevant dividend or distribution; that if such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If the portion of the cash so distributed applicable to one share of the Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Last Reported Sale Price of a share of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution, in lieu of the adjustment set forth above, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder of Notes shall have the right to receive on the date on which such cash dividend or distribution is distributed to holders of Common Stock, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, the amount of cash such Holder would have received had such
provided
 
Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution.
     (e) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for Common Stock, to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the Last Reported Sale Price per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
     where
The adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 4.05(e) shall occur as of the Close of Business on the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires; that in respect of any conversion within 10 Trading Days immediately following, and including, the expiration date of

     (g) The Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least 20 Business Days, the increase is irrevocable during the period and the Board of Directors shall have made a determination that such increase would be in the best interests of the Company, which determination shall be conclusive. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to this Section 4.05(g), the Company shall mail to Holders of record of the Notes a notice of the increase at least one day prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
     (h) The Company may (but shall not be required to) make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 4.05(a), 4.05(b), 4.05(c), 4.05(d), 4.05(e) or 4.05(g), as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) or similar event treated as such for income tax purposes.
     (i) All calculations under this Article 4 shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest cent (including, in the case of any adjustment to the Conversion Rate, the resulting adjustment to the Conversion Price) or to the nearest one ten-thousandth of a share, as the case may be. No adjustment shall be required to be made for the Company's issuance of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock or rights to purchase shares of Common Stock or such convertible or exchangeable securities, other than as provided in this Section 4.05 and in Section 4.11 hereof.
     (j) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume without inquiry that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the
 
adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to each Holder of the Notes. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
     (k) For purposes of this Section 4.05, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company so long as the Company does not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company, but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.
     (l) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the application of the foregoing formulas set forth in this Section 4.05 would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall be made (other than as a result of a reverse share split or share combination) and other than in connection with adjustments and re-adjustments as a result of dividends or distributions having been declared but not paid or made, adjustments to reflect rights or warrants that are not exercised prior to their expiration or termination and adjustments with respect to the distribution or deemed distribution of rights or warrants, or any other Trigger Event or other event with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under Section 4.05(c) was made but which shall all have been redeemed or purchased without exercise by any Holders thereof).

If the holders of the Common Stock receive only cash in any Make-Whole Fundamental Change described in clause (2) of the definition of Fundamental Change, the Stock Price shall be the cash amount paid per share. Otherwise, the Stock Price shall be the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the five Trading Day period, and including, ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Effective Date of the Make-Whole Fundamental Change. However, if the consideration for Common Stock in any Make-Whole Fundamental Change described in clause (2) of the definition of Fundamental Change is comprised entirely of cash, for any conversion of Notes in connection with such Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the Company's obligation to convert the Notes into cash will be calculated based solely on the Stock Price for the transaction and will be deemed to be an amount equal to the applicable Conversion Rate (including any increase to reflect the Cash Make-Whole Premium as described in this Section 4.07), such Stock Price. In such event, the Company's obligation to convert the Notes into cash will be determined and paid to Holders in cash on the third Business Day following the Conversion Date. The Company will notify Holders of the Effective Date of any Make-Whole Fundamental Change and issue a press release announcing such Effective Date no later than 5 Business Days after such Effective date.

(y) In the case of a Merger Event in which the Reference Property (determined, as appropriate, pursuant to the definition of Reference Property in a Mixed Consideration Transaction and excluding any dissenters' appraisal rights) is composed in part of shares of Merger Common Stock, the Initial Dividend Threshold at and after the effective time of such Merger Event will be equal to (x) the Initial Dividend Threshold immediately prior to the effective time of such Merger Event, multiplied by (y) the Merger Valuation Percentage for such Merger Event (such quotient rounded down to nearest cent).
(z) For the avoidance of doubt, in the case of a Merger Event in which the Reference Property (determined, as appropriate, pursuant to the definition of Reference Property in a Mixed Consideration Transaction and excluding any dissenters' appraisal rights) is composed entirely of consideration other than shares of common stock, the Initial Dividend Threshold at and after the effective time of such Merger Event will be equal to zero.
The Company shall not become a party to any Merger Event unless its terms are consistent with this Section 4.08. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article 4 in the judgment of the Board of Directors or the board of directors of the successor Person. If, in the case of any such Merger Event, the Reference Property receivable thereupon by a holder of
 
Common Stock includes shares of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) of a Person other than the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, in such Merger Event, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other Person.
     The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Holder, at the address of such Holder as it appears on the register of the Notes maintained by the Registrar, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture. The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations, mergers, combinations, sales and conveyances. If this Section 4.08 applies to any event or occurrence, Section 4.05 shall not apply.
     SECTION 4.09The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Notes to determine or calculate the Conversion Rate or whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Notes; and the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent make no representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to deliver cash upon the surrender of any Notes for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article 4. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 4.08 relating to the amount of cash receivable by Holders upon the conversion of their Notes after any event referred to in such Section 4.08 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 11.06 of the Base Indenture, may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers' Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto. The Trustee shall have no responsibility to determine if a Supplemental Indenture must be entered into pursuant to Section 4.08.

other rights or warrants that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 4.05 or Section 4.11 hereof; or
     (c) of any reclassification or reorganization of the Common Stock of the Company (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding Common Stock, or a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or of any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party and for which approval of any stockholders of the Company is required, or of the sale, lease or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries; or
     (d) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
then, in each case (unless notice of such event is otherwise required pursuant to another provision of this Supplemental Indenture), the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent and to be mailed to each Holder of Notes at such Holder's address appearing on a list of Holders of Notes, which the Company shall provide to the Trustee, as promptly as practicable but in any event at least 10 days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend (or any other distribution) or rights or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights or warrants are to be determined, or (y) the date on which such reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale, lease, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend (or any other distribution), reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.
     SECTION 4.11To the extent that the Company has a stockholder rights plan in effect prior to the time a Holder converts its Notes such rights have separated from the shares of Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable stockholder rights plan, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company distributed to all holders of the Common Stock, shares of the Company's Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets, property, rights or warrants as described in Section 4.05(c) above, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.
