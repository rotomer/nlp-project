EXHIBIT 99.1
 Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (NYSE:WYN) today announced results for the three months ended March 31, 2011.
PARSIPPANY, N.J. (April 27, 2011)
Highlights:
     "We are pleased to report that 2011 started as 2010 ended, with strong operating performance and accelerating earnings per share growth," said Stephen P. Holmes, chairman and CEO, Wyndham Worldwide. "We delivered strong operating performance across all our businesses and are confident in the sustainability of our growth and cash flow. Our confidence in growth and cash flow generation is reflected in our substantial share repurchase activity so far this year, the significant increase in our share repurchase program as well as the previously announced 25% increase in our dividend for 2011."
 
FIRST QUARTER 2011 OPERATING RESULTS
First quarter revenues increased 7.4% from the prior year period to $952 million. The revenue growth reflects continued sales momentum across the Company's three business units and incremental contributions from acquisitions.
For the first quarter of 2011, adjusted net income increased by 23% to $79 million, or $0.44 per diluted share compared with $64 million, or $0.34 per diluted share for the same period in 2010. The increase reflects strong operational performance by the Company's three business units. Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2011 excludes a $7 million after-tax charge related to the repurchase of a portion of the Company's convertible notes and an $8 million after-tax non-cash impairment charge related to a write-down of an international joint venture in the Company's hotel business. These were partially offset by an $8 million after-tax benefit related to the resolution of certain contingent liabilities and assets.
First quarter 2011 reported net income grew 44% to $72 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared with net income of $50 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2010.
Free cash flow increased 11% to $185 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2011, compared with $166 million during the same period in 2010. The growth in free cash flow reflects higher cash earnings and more efficient working capital utilization. For the quarter ended March 31, 2011, cash provided by operating activities was $229 million, compared with $205 million in the prior year period.
BUSINESS UNIT RESULTS
Lodging (Wyndham Hotel Group)
Revenues were $149 million in the first quarter of 2011, an increase of 3%, compared with the first quarter of 2010, reflecting a RevPAR increase of 7.4%, or 6.4% in constant currency, and incremental revenues related to the TRYP hotel brand.
First quarter 2011 adjusted EBITDA was $40 million, an increase of 21%, compared with the first quarter of 2010, primarily as a result of the RevPAR improvement and lower costs. Adjusted EBITDA excludes a $13 million impairment charge related to the write-down of an investment in an international joint venture in the Company's hotel business.
As of March 31, 2011, the Company's hotel system consisted of approximately 7,190 properties and 609,600 rooms. The development pipeline included approximately 830 hotels and over 102,000 rooms, of which 57% were new construction and 57% were international.
 
Vacation Exchange and Rentals (Wyndham Exchange & Rentals)
Revenues were $356 million in the first quarter of 2011, an increase of 19% compared with the first quarter of 2010, reflecting overall strength in vacation rentals and incremental revenues from acquisitions.
Exchange revenues were $194 million, an increase of 3%, compared with the first quarter of 2010. In constant currency, exchange revenues increased 2%, reflecting a modest increase in both exchange revenue per member and the average number of members.
Vacation rental revenues were $150 million, which included $25 million of incremental revenues related to acquisitions, compared with $105 million in the first quarter of 2010. Excluding the impact of the incremental revenues from acquisitions, net revenues generated from rental transactions and related services increased 19%, reflecting strong performance in the German rental market.
Excluding $4 million of acquisition costs in the first quarter of 2010, first quarter of 2011 EBITDA increased 11% compared with adjusted EBITDA of $84 million in the prior-year period, reflecting increases in vacation rental volume and average net price per rental.
Vacation Ownership (Wyndham Vacation Ownership)
Gross Vacation Ownership Interest (VOI) sales were $319 million in the first quarter of 2011, up 4% from the first quarter of 2010, reflecting an 11% increase in tour flow, partially offset by a 6% decrease in volume per guest. The changes in tour flow and volume per guest reflect the Company's focus on increasing sales to new owners.
Total segment revenues were $450 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared with $444 million in the first quarter of 2010, reflecting incremental commission revenues under the Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model (WAAM) and a lower provision for loan losses.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2011 increased 17% to $96 million, compared with EBITDA of $82 million in the first quarter of 2010. This EBITDA increase reflected growth in the property management business and the lower provision for loan losses. Results were also impacted by lower sales commission expenses and the absence of a litigation charge in the first quarter 2011 that was incurred in the first quarter 2010.
Other Items
 
Balance Sheet Information as of March 31, 2011:
A schedule of debt is included in the financial tables section of this press release.
Outlook
The Company is increasing full-year 2011 adjusted EPS guidance from $2.05  $2.15 to $2.15  $2.25, based on a diluted share count of 173 million.
The Company reiterates full-year 2011 guidance:
The guidance reflects assumptions used for internal planning purposes. All guidance excludes legacy items, restructuring costs, debt extinguishment, asset impairments, and acquisition costs, if any, which may have a positive or negative impact on reported results. If economic conditions change materially from current levels, these assumptions and our guidance may change materially. It is not practicable to provide a reconciliation of forecasted adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because certain items cannot be reasonably estimated or predicted at this time. Any such items could be significant to our financial results.

Table 1
In addition to other measures, management evaluates the operating results of each of its reportable segments based upon net revenues and "EBITDA," which is defined as net income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense (excluding consumer financing interest), interest income (excluding consumer financing interest) and income taxes, each of which is presented on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company believes that EBITDA is a useful measure of performance for the Company's industry segments which, when considered with GAAP measures, the Company believes gives a more complete understanding of its operating performance. The Company's presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.
The following tables summarize net revenues and EBITDA for reportable segments, as well as reconcile EBITDA to net income for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010:
 
The following tables summarize net revenues and Adjusted EBITDA for reportable segments for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 (for a description of adjustments by segment, see Table 7):

Table 3 (3 of 3)
Lodging
Represents the number of rooms at lodging properties at the end of the period which are either (i) under franchise and/or management agreements, (ii) properties under affiliation agreements for which we receive a fee for reservation and/or other services provided or (iii) properties managed under a joint venture.
Number of Rooms:
Represents the percentage of available rooms occupied during the period.
Average Occupancy Rate:
Represents the average rate charged for renting a lodging room for one day.
Average Daily Rate (ADR):
Represents revenue per available room and is calculated by multiplying average occupancy rate by ADR. Comparable RevPAR represents RevPAR of hotels which are included in both periods.
RevPAR:
Vacation Exchange and Rentals
Represents members in our vacation exchange programs who pay annual membership dues. For additional fees, such participants are entitled to exchange intervals for intervals at other properties affiliated with our vacation exchange business. In addition, certain participants may exchange intervals for other leisure-related products and services.
Average Number of Members:
Represents total annualized revenues generated from fees associated with memberships, exchange transactions, member-related rentals and other servicing for the period divided by the average number of vacation exchange members during the period.
Exchange Revenue Per Member:
Represents the number of transactions that are generated in connection with customers booking their vacation rental stays through us. One rental transaction is recorded each time a standard one-week rental is booked.
Vacation Rental Transactions:
Represents the net rental price generated from renting vacation properties to customers and other related rental servicing fees divided by the number of vacation rental transactions.
Average Net Price Per Vacation Rental:
Vacation Ownership
Represents sales of vacation ownership interest (VOIs), including Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model sales, before the net effect of percentage-of-completion accounting and loan loss provisions. See Table 9 for a reconciliation of Gross VOI sales to Vacation Ownership Interest Sales. We believe that Gross VOI sales provides an enhanced understanding of the performance of our vacation ownership business because it directly measures the sales volume of this business during a given reporting period.
Gross Vacation Ownership Interest Sales:
Represents the number of tours taken by guests in our efforts to sell vacation ownership interests.
Tours:
Represents gross VOI sales (excluding tele-sales upgrades, which are non-tour upgrade sales) divided by the number of tours. We have excluded non-tour upgrade sales in the calculation of VPG because non-tour upgrade sales are generated by a different marketing channel. See Table 9 for a detail of tele-sales upgrades for 2007-2010. We believe that VPG provides an enhanced understanding of the performance of our vacation ownership business because it directly measures the efficiency of this business' tour selling efforts during a given reporting period.
Volume per Guest (VPG):
General
Represents a comparison eliminating the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations between periods.
Constant Currency:

FREE CASH FLOW                         
The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures, equity investments and development advances, excluding cash payments related to the Company's contingent tax liabilities that it assumed and is responsible for pursuant to its separation from Cendant. The Company considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, equity investments and hotel development advances, can be used for strategic opportunities, including making acquisitions, paying dividends, repurchasing the Company's common stock and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of the Company's operating results to its competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Wyndham Worldwide is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period.
The following table provides more details on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measure and the related reconciliation between these financial measures:
GROSS VOI SALES
