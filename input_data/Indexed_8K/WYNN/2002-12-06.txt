        (c)  Concurrently with the delivery by the Company of each preliminary Advance Request pursuant to subsection (a) above, the Company shall deliver (i) to the FF&E Agent, a copy of
Appendix XI

Section 2.5.1(a)(iii)

Section 2.5.2

Section 2.4.1(a)
above, to deliver to the Disbursement Agent and the Construction Consultant a final Advance Request containing all exhibits, attachments and certificates required thereby, to the extent that such exhibits, attachments and certificates were not previously delivered with the preliminary Advance Request or have been modified subsequent to such delivery (other than the Construction Consultant's Advance Certificate), all appropriately completed and duly executed by a Responsible Officer of the Company. Each final Advance Request shall be accompanied by a letter identifying and reconciling any corrections made between the preliminary Advance Request and the final Advance Request.

        (b)  Concurrently with the delivery by the Company of each final Advance Request pursuant to subsection (a) above, the Company shall deliver to each Funding Agent and the Disbursement Agent a final Notice of Advance Request appropriately completed and duly executed by a Responsible Officer of the Company, which final Notice of Advance request shall include
Appendix XI
to the Advance Request as approved, deemed approved and/or revised pursuant to
Section 2.4.1(e)
above. Each final Notice of Advance Request shall state that pursuant to an Advance Request being concurrently delivered to the Disbursement Agent, the Company is requesting that an Advance be made on the Advance Date set forth in such final Advance Request. Each Funding Agent shall, as soon as practicable (but no later than two (2) Banking Days) after receiving each final Notice of Advance Request, deliver a notice confirming such receipt to the Disbursement Agent and, in the case of the Bank Agent and the FF&E Agent, confirming that the Company's calculation of interest and fees to become due and payable under their respective Facilities on and after the requested Advance Date and through the scheduled next succeeding Advance Date is accurate (or, if not accurate, shall provide the appropriate revisions to the Disbursement Agent).
        (c)  Within five (5) days (but in no event later than four (4) Banking Days prior to the requested Advance Date) after its receipt of each final Advance Request pursuant to subsection (a) above, the Construction Consultant shall deliver directly to the Disbursement Agent (with a copy to the Company) its certificate with respect to such Advance Request, in the form of
Exhibit C-2
either approving or disapproving the Advance Request (the "
Construction Consultant's Advance Certificate
");
provided
that if the Construction Consultant disapproves one or more particular payments or disbursements to any Contractor or Subcontractor requested by the Advance Request, but the Advance Request otherwise complies with the requirements hereof, then the Construction Consultant shall approve the Advance Request and all payments and disbursements requested therein other than the particular payments or disbursements so disapproved. If the Construction Consultant disapproves the Advance Request or any one or more particular payments requested therein, the Construction Consultant shall provide the Company, in reasonable detail, its reason(s) for such disapproval.
        (d)  Promptly after receipt of a request therefor, the Disbursement Agent shall deliver copies of any Advance Request to the Funding Agents.
        2.4.3
    Funding Notices from Disbursement Agent.
    
        (a)  (i) Promptly after delivery of each final Advance Request and related final Notice of Advance Request by the Company pursuant to
Section 2.4.2(a)
and
(b)
above, the Disbursement Agent shall review the same in order to reconcile the information set forth in the Advance Request with the information set forth in the related Notice of Advance Request and determine whether all required documentation has been provided and whether all applicable conditions precedent pursuant to this Agreement have been satisfied. In particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Disbursement Agent shall verify, to the extent contemplated herein, based on information provided to it by the Funding Agents, the Company and the Construction Consultant, (A) the Company's calculation of Available Funds, including Anticipated Earnings, set forth in the Advance Request, (B) that the Project is In Balance, (C) that the allocation of the requested Advance among the various funding sources complies with the provisions of
Section 2.5
, and (D) that the Company's calculation of interest and fees to become due and payable under the Bank Credit Agreement, the Second Mortgage Notes and the FF&E Facility, in each case, from and after the requested Advance Date and prior to the immediately succeeding Advance Date, is accurate. Subject to the other subsections of this
Section 2.4
, at such time as the Disbursement Agent has received the Construction Consultant's Advance Certificate as required by
Section 2.4.2(c)
, and otherwise
determines that the applicable conditions precedent set forth in
Article 3
with respect to a requested Advance have been satisfied, but no less than three (3) Banking Days prior to the requested Advance Date, the Disbursement Agent shall countersign the Notice of Advance Request and deliver the same to the Company and each of the Funding Agents (as so countersigned, an "
Advance Confirmation Notice
").
        (ii)  In the event that, pursuant to
Section 2.4.2(c)
, the Construction Consultant approves only a portion of the payments or disbursements requested by the Advance Request or, if based on its review of the Advance Request and accompanying Notice of Advance Request, the Disbursement Agent finds any minor or purely mathematical errors or inaccuracies in the Advance Request or the Notice of Advance Request (including any inaccuracy in the allocations made pursuant to
Section 2.5
hereof), but the Advance Request and Notice of Advance Request otherwise conform to the requirements of this Agreement, the Disbursement Agent shall (A) notify the Company thereof, (B) revise (to the extent it is able to do so) or request that the Company revise such certificates to remove the request for the disapproved payment and/or rectify any errors or inaccuracies, (C) deliver or request that the Company execute and deliver to the Funding Agents the revised Notice of Advance Request and (D) approve the requested Advance and issue the Advance Confirmation Notice after making the required revisions (or receiving from the Company the revised certificates) on the basis of the certificates as so revised. In the event that the Disbursement Agent revises the Advance Request and Notice of Advance Request so as to increase the amounts to be advanced under the Bank Credit Facility or the FF&E Facility, the amounts of such increase shall constitute the same type of Loans as requested in such Advance Request (unless otherwise prohibited under the Bank Credit Agreement or the FF&E Facility Agreement, as applicable). In the event that the Disbursement Agent revises the Advance Request and Notice of Advance Request so as to decrease the amounts to be advanced under the Bank Credit Facility or the FF&E Facility, the amounts of such decrease shall (unless otherwise requested by the Company and permitted under the Bank Credit Agreement or the FF&E Facility Agreement, as applicable) first reduce the amount of Base Rate Loans requested under such Facility and then reduce the amount of Eurodollar Loans requested under such Facility. All references to a particular requested Advance, Advance Request or Notice of Advance Request in the ensuing provisions of this
Article 2
shall, to the extent the context so requires, refer to the same as revised or modified pursuant to the preceding sentence.
        (b)  In the event that the Disbursement Agent (i) on or prior to the requested Advance Date determines pursuant to
Section 2.4.3(a)
that the conditions precedent to an Advance have not been satisfied or (ii) prior to the requested Advance Date receives notice from any Funding Agent that a Potential Event of Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, then the Disbursement Agent shall notify the Company and each Funding Agent thereof as soon as reasonably possible but in no event later than one (1) Banking Day after such determination or receipt, as the case may be (a "
Stop Funding Notice
"). The Stop Funding Notice shall specify, in reasonable detail, the conditions precedent which the Disbursement Agent has determined have not been satisfied and/or shall attach a copy of any notice of default received by the Disbursement Agent. Upon such written notice from the Disbursement Agent, and subject to the provisions of
Section 3.5
, (i) neither the Bank Lenders nor the FF&E Lenders shall have any obligation to advance their respective Facilities' portion of the requested Advance, if any, (ii) the Disbursement Agent shall not withdraw any funds from the Second Mortgage Notes Proceeds Account for the purpose of transferring such funds to the Disbursement Account or for the purpose of paying any Debt Service on the Bank Credit Facility or the FF&E Facility (provided that the Disbursement Agent shall withdraw funds from the Second Mortgage Notes Proceeds Account for the purpose of paying
scheduled Debt Service on the Second Mortgage Notes), (iii) subject to
Section 3.2
the Disbursement Agent shall not withdraw any funds from the Company's Funds Account to satisfy such requested Advance, (iv) the Disbursement Agent shall not withdraw, transfer or release any funds on deposit in the Interest Payment Account, (v) the Disbursement Agent shall not withdraw, transfer or release to the Company any funds then on deposit in the Disbursement Account or the FF&E Proceeds Account (other than in respect of wires previously issued under
Sections 2.6.1(c) or (e)
) and (vi) any Advance Confirmation Notice issued prior to the issuance of a Stop Funding Notice (if the Advance to which such Advance Confirmation Notice relates has not been made) shall become null and void and of no force or effect; provided that such nullification of any such Advance Confirmation Notice shall not affect the obligations of the Company for break funding costs under the Bank Credit Facility and the FF&E Facility.
        (c)  Prior to the earliest of (i) termination of the "
Term Loan Commitments
" (as defined in the Bank Credit Agreement) other than due to the funding in full thereof, (ii) termination of the "
Revolving Credit Commitments
" (as defined in the Bank Credit Agreement), (iii) termination of the "
Commitments
" (as defined in the FF&E Facility Agreement) and (iv) the exercise of remedies by any Funding Agent in respect of any Project Security, unless any such action has been rescinded, at such time, if ever, as the Disbursement Agent (x) determines that the condition precedent to the requested Advance which had not been satisfied has become satisfied or (y) receives notice from the Funding Agent who issued the notice of default described in the preceding paragraph that such Potential Event of Default or Event of Default no longer exists, as the case may be, the Disbursement Agent shall deliver an Advance Confirmation Notice to the Company and each of the Funding Agents.
        (d)  In the event that a Funding Agent entitled to waive conditions precedent to funding pursuant to
Section 3.5
informs the Disbursement Agent in writing that it has waived the event or events giving rise to the Stop Funding Notice, the Disbursement Agent shall deliver an Advance Confirmation Notice (modified, if required, to apply only to amounts to be advanced under such Funding Agent's Facility unless all Funding Agents entitled to waive conditions with respect to such Advance Request have waived the conditions, in which case the Disbursement Agent shall deliver an Advance Confirmation Notice with respect to all Advances requested by the Company) to the Company and each of the Funding Agents.
        2.4.4

Section 2.4.3(c)
or
(d)
above, on the third (3) Banking Day after such issuance, before 12:00 p.m. New York, New York time, (x) the Bank Lenders (subject to
rd
Section 2.5.3
) shall deposit or cause to be deposited in the Disbursement Account, in immediately available funds, their Facility's portion of the requested Advance, if any, as determined pursuant to
Sections 2.5.1, 2.5.2 and 2.5.4
and set forth in the related Advance Confirmation Notice and (y) the FF&E Lenders (subject to
Section 2.5.5
) shall deposit or cause to be deposited in the FF&E Proceeds Account, in immediately available funds, their Facility's portion of the requested Advance, if any, as determined pursuant to
Section 2.5.1
and set forth in the related Advance Confirmation Notice and, if the final Notice of Advance Request includes a request for the issuance of one or more Letters of Credit under the Bank Revolving Facility, the Bank Agent shall also send written notice to the Disbursement Agent that the "Issuing Lenders" (as defined in the Bank Credit Agreement) under the Bank Revolving Facility are committed to issue each such Letter of Credit. Amounts deposited by or on behalf of ULLICO, as Bank Lender, shall be deemed to have been applied to fund Project Costs due and owing to the Prime Contractor; it being
understood that, notwithstanding such application, ULLICO shall enjoy the same rights and privileges over the Project Security as any other Project Secured Party.
        (ii)  Upon confirming that all funds required to be deposited in the Disbursement Account and the FF&E Proceeds Account pursuant to clause (i) above have been deposited and, if applicable, upon receipt of the Bank Agent's confirmation that the "Issuing Lenders" (as defined in the Bank Credit Agreement) under the Bank Revolving Facility are committed to issue each requested Letter of Credit, the Disbursement Agent shall (subject to
Section 2.4.3(b)
) promptly, considering the requirements of this Agreement, withdraw from the Company's Funds Account, the Second Mortgage Notes Proceeds Account and the Bank Proceeds Account the portion of the Advance to be funded from each such account as determined pursuant to
Sections 2.5
and
2.9(d)
and set forth in the related Advance Confirmation Notice and deposit such funds in the Disbursement Account and shall notify the Bank Agent that such transfer to the Disbursement Account has been made. Upon receipt of such notice, if applicable, the Bank Agent shall instruct the "Issuing Lenders" (as defined in the Bank Credit Agreement) under the Bank Revolving Facility to issue the requested Letters of Credit. All funds so deposited in the Disbursement Account shall thereafter be applied by the Disbursement Agent as provided in
Section 2.6
.
        (b)  None of the Disbursement Agent, the Bank Agent or the FF&E Agent shall be responsible for any Bank Lender's or FF&E Lender's failure to make any required Advance (including, if applicable, the failure of any "Issuing Lender" under the Bank Revolving Facility to issue any Letter of Credit). The Disbursement Agent shall not release to the Company any amounts properly advanced until all Advances requested by the relevant Advance Request have been deposited in the Disbursement Account and the FF&E Proceeds Account and, if applicable, the Bank Agent has confirmed that the "Issuing Lenders" (as defined in the Bank Credit Agreement) under the Bank Revolving Facility are committed to issue each requested Letter of Credit, unless the Lenders who have made the Advances request such release (the Disbursement Agent shall promptly notify all Funding Agents upon receiving any such request). However, the withholding of such Advances by the Disbursement Agent shall not release the Lender who failed to make the Advance under its Facility (including, if applicable, any Issuing Lender under the Bank Revolving Facility who failed to issue a Letter of Credit) from liability to the other Lenders and the Company. The Disbursement Agent shall have no liability to the Company arising from any Stop Funding Notice issued pursuant to
Section 2.4.3(b)
at the request of any Funding Agent (a "
Stop Funding Request
"), whether or not such Funding Agent was entitled to make any such Stop Funding Request. None of the Funding Agents shall have any liability to the Company, the Disbursement Agent, any other Funding Agent or any Lender arising from any Stop Funding Notice issued by the Disbursement Agent in response to a Stop Funding Request by such Funding Agent;
provided, however
, that nothing herein shall release from liability the Funding Agent who issued the Stop Funding Request if such issuance resulted from, or constituted an act of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Funding Agent, as finally judicially determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

    Change in Facts Certified.
    The Company shall promptly notify the Disbursement Agent prior to the making of any Advances in the event that any of the matters to which the Company certified in the corresponding Advance Request are no longer true and correct in all material respects (provided that the foregoing materiality qualifier shall not apply to any certification contained in such Advance Request which by its own terms already includes a standard of materiality), as of the applicable Advance Date (except that any certification that relates expressly to an earlier date shall be deemed made only as of such earlier date). The acceptance by the
Company of the proceeds of any Advance shall constitute a re-certification by the Company, as of the applicable Advance Date, of all matters certified to in the related Advance Request.
        2.4.6
    References to Dates.
    In the event that any day or date referred to in the foregoing provisions of this

Each Permit described in
Exhibit M
as not required to have been obtained by the date that this representation is deemed to be made (other than the gaming license) is of a type that is routinely granted on application and compliance with the conditions for issuance.

as a result of Company's failure to so remove such easements, then the Company (a) agrees that the Disbursement Agent shall have the right to authorize such advances as it deems appropriate in order to remove or insure over the utility easements as exceptions to the title insurance policies in favor of the Project Secured Parties, and (b) hereby grants to the Disbursement Agent an irrevocable power of attorney to take such further steps in the name of the Company as the Construction Consultant determines are appropriate in order to remove or insure over such easements.

On committing to a transaction for the credit of the Collateral Accounts pursuant to an instruction permitted in accordance with Section 4, Securities Intermediary may, (i) pending settlement, block (A) the Investments to be sold or (B) credit balances sufficient to settle any acquisition and, (ii) at the time of settlement, deliver such Investments or funds in accordance with the rules, custom or practice of the particular market.

It is understood and agreed by Pledgor and Secured Party that, although Securities Intermediary will use reasonable efforts to effect the transactions set forth in the preceding sentence, Securities Intermediary shall incur no liability for its failure to effect the same unless its failure is the result of wilful misconduct.

    No Setoff, etc.
    Securities Intermediary shall not exercise on its own behalf any claim, right of set-off, banker's lien, clearing lien, counterclaim or similar right against any of the Collateral; provided that Securities Intermediary may deduct, from any credit balances, any usual and ordinary transaction and administration fees payable in connection with the administration and operation of the Collateral Accounts. Except for claims for deductions permitted in the preceding sentence, Securities Intermediary agrees that any security interest it may have in the Collateral Accounts or any security entitlement carried therein shall be subordinate and junior to the interest of Secured Party.
        (k)
    Only Agreement.
    This Agreement shall govern the actions, rights and obligations of Securities Intermediary, and shall determine the governing law, with respect to the Collateral Accounts and the Collateral notwithstanding any term or condition in any agreement other than this Agreement as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified in writing.
        (l)
    Care of Financial Assets.

        (d)
