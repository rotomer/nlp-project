Exhibit 99.1 Wynn Resorts Announces Operating Data through May 31, 2005 LAS VEGAS, June 2nd , 2005 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Wynn Resorts, Limited (Nasdaq: WYNN) today released operating data for Wynn Las Vegas through May 31, 2005, representing the property's first 34 days of operations. The initial reaction from customers has been overwhelmingly positive and revenue levels have exceeded our expectations. Wynn Las Vegas net gaming revenues for the first 34 days of operations were $64.3 million. The slot segment produced total net revenues of $20.2 million, with a win per unit per day of $304. The table games segment generated net revenues of $42.7 million, representing win per table per day of $9,244 in the period. Since our opening on April 28th, 2005, Wynn Las Vegas average daily room rate was $308 with occupancy averaging 91% as we strategically increased room availability to 100%. Gross non-gaming revenues for the 34 days, which include $15.4 million of complimentary revenues, were in excess of $76.6 million, as hotel, retail, food and beverage and other departments surpassed our estimates. "We are delighted with our first full month of operations, but we are reminded that opening a resort of this caliber and this scope is a daunting challenge. As the weeks progress and our opening and startup challenges are met one at a time, operating efficiencies will emerge. This process is far from over and will take several months. The early results should be measured accordingly," commented Steve Wynn, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Wynn Resorts, Limited. This release contains forward-looking statements regarding operating trends and future results of operations. Such forward-looking information involves important risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect anticipated results in the future and, accordingly, such results may differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us.
