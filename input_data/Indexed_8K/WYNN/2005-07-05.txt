Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. The Wynn Las Vegas casino resort includes an art gallery that displays rare paintings from The Wynn Collection, a private collection of fine art owned by Mr. and Mrs. Stephen A. Wynn. Mr. Wynn is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Wynn Resorts, Limited ("WRL"), and Mrs. Wynn is a Director of WRL. Prior to June 30, 2005, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC ("WLV"), a wholly owned subsidiary of WRL, leased The Wynn Collection from Mr. and Mrs. Wynn. On June 30, 2005, Mr. Wynn, WRL and WLV restructured the lease arrangements for The Wynn Collection, including entry into the following agreements: o an Agreement of Termination, dated as of June 30, 2005, between Mr. Wynn and WLV, terminating the Third Amended and Restated Art Rental and Licensing Agreement, dated as of August 6, 2004, by and between Mr. Wynn and WLV; o a Fourth Amended and Restated Art Rental and Licensing Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2005, by and between Mr. Wynn and Wynn Gallery, LLC ("Wynn Gallery"), a wholly owned subsidiary of WRL; and o an Art Gallery Lease, dated as of June 30, 2005, between WLV and Wynn Gallery. The terms of the Fourth Amended and Restated Art Rental and Licensing Agreement are substantially the same as those of the Third Amended and Restated Art Rental and Licensing Agreement, except that Wynn Gallery, instead of WLV, leases The Wynn Collection from Mr. Wynn. The annual rental fee continues to be $1. Wynn Gallery is entitled to retain all revenues from the public display of The Wynn Collection and the related merchandising revenues, and is responsible for all expenses incurred in exhibiting and safeguarding The Wynn Collection, including the cost of insurance (including terrorism insurance) and taxes relating to the rental of The Wynn Collection. After specified notice periods, Wynn Gallery or Mr. Wynn may terminate the lease. Subject to certain notice restrictions, Mr. Wynn has the right to remove or replace any or all of the works of art displayed in the art gallery. Under the Art Gallery Lease, Wynn Gallery leases from WLV the space in the Wynn Las Vegas casino resort in which The Wynn Collection is displayed. The maximum term of the lease is ten years, and monthly rent is $11,342 (the "Base Rent") plus 50% of the net profits of the art gallery to the extent such amount exceeds the Base Rent. In addition, under the Art Gallery Lease, WLV will provide certain services to Wynn Gallery in connection with the operation of the art gallery, including utilities, cleaning, pest control, personnel services and insurance coverage. In consideration for these services, Wynn Gallery will pay WLV an amount equal to its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such services plus a fee equal to 5% of such expenses. Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement. The information set forth under Item 1.01 of this Report is incorporated herein by reference.
