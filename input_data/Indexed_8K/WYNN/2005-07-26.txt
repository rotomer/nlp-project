Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On July 20, 2005, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC ("WLV"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, Limited, entered into an agreement with Spamalot, LLC (the "Producer") to produce and present "Monty Python's Spamalot" in a new theatre to be constructed at the Wynn Las Vegas casino resort. The new theatre is expected to be adjacent to the existing Wynn Theatre and will include a merchandise store, food and beverage facilities and a themed "Spamalot environment." Under the agreement, WLV is responsible for construction of the theatre and related facilities, as well as advancement of initial production costs. WLV expects that these costs, together with the rights fees described below, will exceed $50 million. The Producer will produce and manage the show. The construction cost and completion date for the theatre, and the opening date for the production, have not yet been determined. Under the agreement, WLV is obligated to pay an up front production rights fee, a portion of which is subject to recoupment. After payment of royalties to the Producer and others, payment of the weekly operating expenses, and recoupment by WLV of the initial production costs, WLV and the Producer will share in the net profits of the show. WLV and the Producer also will share in the net merchandise revenues. WLV and the Producer will mutually agree on budgets for the initial production costs and weekly operating expenses. WLV will be responsible for any weekly operating losses, but expenditures in excess of budgeted amounts will be the responsibility of the Producer. Weekly operating expenses will include a theatre rental fee to WLV and compensation to WLV for utilities, maintenance, repairs and other customary theatre expenses. The agreement has a term of seven years, starting on the date of the first paid public performance, subject to extension for an additional period of three years at WLV's option. The agreement may be terminated by either WLV or the Producer if, at any time after the first year, the production does not generate net profits for any six weeks in any three month period. During the term, the Producer has agreed to certain restrictions and holdbacks with respect to performances of the show in Nevada, California and Arizona.
