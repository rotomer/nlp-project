Item 8.01. Other Events. On October 14, 2005, Wynn Resorts (Macau) S.A., a subsidiary of the Registrant ("Wynn Macau"), entered into two interest rate swap agreements with Deutsche Bank AG, Societe Generale Paris and Bank of America Securities Asia (together, the "Banks") to hedge a portion of the underlying interest risk on future borrowings under Wynn Macau's existing $729 million senior term loan facility. Under the first hedge agreement, Wynn Macau will pay to the Banks a fixed interest rate of approximately 4.84% on borrowings estimated to be incurred under the senior term loan facility up to a maximum of approximately US$198.2 million, in exchange for payments from the Banks on the same amounts at a variable interest rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") at the time of payment. Under the second hedge agreement, Wynn Macau will pay to the Banks a fixed interest rate of approximately 4.77% on borrowings estimated to be incurred under the senior term loan facility up to a maximum of approximately HK$1.1 billion (approximately US$140.3 million), in exchange for payments from the Banks on the same amounts at a variable interest rate based on the applicable Hong Kong Interbank Offer Rate ("HIBOR") at the time of payment. The term of both hedge agreements is November 28, 2005 through November 28, 2008. Wynn Macau's senior debt facility currently provides that term loans will bear interest at LIBOR or HIBOR plus a margin of 3.0% until the opening of Wynn Macau, a destination casino resort in the Macau Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China (expected to be in the third quarter of 2006), at which time the interest rate will reduce to LIBOR or HIBOR plus a margin of 2.75%. The senior debt facility also provides for further reductions in the margin on the term loans if Wynn Macau satisfies certain prescribed leverage ratio tests. Wynn Macau currently has no amounts outstanding under the bank facility.
