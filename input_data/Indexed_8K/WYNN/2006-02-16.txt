EXHIBIT 99.1 Media Contacts: --------------- Denise Randazzo Wynn Las Vegas 702-770-2121 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - --------------------- Avenue Q to End Exclusive Run in Las Vegas LAS VEGAS - February 14, 2006 - Wynn Las Vegas announced the end of Avenue Q's exclusive run at Wynn Las Vegas. Steve Wynn explained, "As we finalized our architectural plans for Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, including additional casino area, rooms, meeting and convention space, food and beverage and retail elements, we realized that if we could convert the Broadway Theatre currently housing "Avenue Q" to the Grail Theatre for "Monty Python's Spamalot," we would be able to most efficiently accommodate those new elements and meet the demands of our hotel addition, which is in excess of 2,000 rooms. By releasing the producers of Avenue Q from their exclusive non-touring agreement, we were able to accomplish this architectural goal without having to invade our golf course real estate. Giving up the delights of Avenue Q was a very difficult, but necessary choice in view of all of the relevant factors. Happily, we will be able to enjoy Avenue Q through its final performance on Sunday, May 28, 2006 at its regular show times, giving all Las Vegas visitors and residents an opportunity to experience everything wonderful that Avenue Q has to offer." Kevin McCollum from The Producing Office, commented, "Audiences and critics love Avenue Q. We look forward to sharing it with theatre audiences around the world." Avenue Q, the winner of three 2004 Tony Awards, including Best Musical, is now in its third year on Broadway at the Golden Theatre (252 W. 45th Street), has music and lyrics by Jeff Marx and Robert Lopez (Tony Award), book by Jeff Whitty (Tony Award), and is based on an original concept by Jeff Marx and Jeff Whitty. Avenue Q is directed by Jason Moore, and has puppets conceived and designed by Rick Lyon.
