Wynn Macau In June 2004, the Company broke ground on Wynn Macau, its destination casino resort in Macau, China. The first phase of the project will utilize approximately 11 of a total site area of 16 acres of land and includes 600 hotel rooms and suites, approximately 100,000 square feet of casino gaming space, seven restaurants, approximately 26,000 square feet of retail space, a spa, a salon, entertainment lounges and meeting facilities. We expect the first phase to open to the public in the third quarter of 2006. The second phase will include an additional 136,000 square feet of casino space, two restaurants, retail, a theater, and a dramatic front feature attraction. The second phase will be built on the remaining five acres of the Wynn Macau site and will be integrated into the first phase of Wynn Macau. The second phase is expected to be completed and open to the public by the third quarter of 2007. Construction of Wynn Macau is progressing on time and within budget as the first phase is expected to open to the public in the third quarter of 2006. Superstructure works are complete for the podium and tower. Certain areas in the first phase of the project, namely retail and the information technology data center, have been handed over to operations. Final design work on the second phase is rapidly moving from the foundations to the structure. Wynn Macau will also add an additional 150 table games in the second phase. The second phase will now include 300 table games taking the total table count in the overall facility from 350 tables to 500 tables. The addition to the casino in the second phase is expected to cost approximately $70 million and is anticipated to be funded through bank facilities. The second phase, including the additional 150 tables, remains on target to open by the third quarter of 2007. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has incurred approximately $427.2 million of a total project budget of approximately $1.2 billion (including the expansion of the second phase), with approximately $748.4 million to be spent to complete Wynn Macau. Encore at Wynn Las Vegas We have refined the design of Encore to currently feature a 2,054-room hotel tower fully integrated with Wynn Las Vegas, consisting of 144 suites and 1,910 guest rooms, as well as an approximately 44,000 square feet casino, additional convention and meeting space, plus restaurants, nightclubs, swimming pools, a spa and salon, and retail outlets. Once the Company has finalized the budget and plans for Encore, it will seek the necessary approvals from its Board of Directors and lenders. We expect Encore to open by the end of 2008. Other Factors Affecting Earnings Interest expense, net of $5.4 million in capitalized interest, was $36.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2005. For the full year 2005, interest expense was $99.5 million, net of $50.0 million in capitalized interest. Depreciation and amortization expenses were $35.8 million, and pre-opening expenses, primarily related to Wynn Macau, totaled $8.3 million during the quarter. For the full year, Depreciation and amortization expenses were $103.3 million and pre-opening expenses were $96.9 million. Corporate expense in the fourth quarter was $10.8 million, and $24.6 million for the full year 2005. The Company is evaluating the appropriate hedge accounting interpretation under FAS 133 as it relates to $200.0 million of existing interest rate swaps. Depending upon the final outcome of this research, net income for 2005 may increase up to $5.0 million. Balance Sheet and Capital Expenditures Our total cash balances at the end of the quarter were $876.9 million, including unrestricted cash balances of $434.3 million and restricted cash balances of $442.6 million. Total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $2.1 billion, including $250 million of Convertible Debentures and $78.9 million of Wynn Macau related debt. Capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2005, net of changes in construction payables and retention, totaled $121.8 million, of which $83.1 million was related to Wynn Macau.

Forward-looking Statements This release contains forward-looking statements regarding operating trends and future results of operations. Such forward-looking information involves important risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect anticipated results in the future and, accordingly, such results may differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, competition in the casino/hotel and resorts industries, the Company's brief operating history, the Company's dependence on existing management, levels of travel, leisure and casino spending, general domestic or international economic conditions, and changes in gaming laws or regulations. Additional information concerning potential factors that could affect the Company's financial results are included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 and the Company's other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company is under no obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligation to) update its forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Non-GAAP financial measures (1) Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses, earnings or losses from unconsolidated affiliates and other non-operating income and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a principal basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses adjusted EBITDA as the primary measure of the operating performance of Wynn Las Vegas and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors. The Company also presents adjusted EBITDA because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a company's ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to GAAP financial measures. In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including Wynn Resorts, Limited, have historically excluded pre-opening expense, property charges and corporate expense, which do not relate to the management of specific casino properties from their EBITDA calculations. However, adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of operating performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company has significant uses of cash flow, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments and taxes, which are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA. (2) Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EPS are presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that these financial measures are widely used to measure the performance, and as a principal basis for valuation, of gaming companies. These measures are considered by many to be a better indicator on which to base expectations of future results than income computed in accordance with GAAP. Wynn Resorts' calculation of adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited. The Company has included schedules in the tables that accompany this release that reconcile (i) net loss and net loss per share to adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share, and (ii) net loss to adjusted EBITDA.
