On March 28, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Compensation Committee") approved performance criterion applicable to the payment of bonuses for the calendar year 2006 under the Incentive Plan. The approved performance criterion is an EBITDA target for the Company's Wynn Las Vegas project.

Kramer, Schorr and Pascal and Ms. Chen of 200% of their annual base salary and for Mr. Strzemp of 100% of his base salary (determined in accordance with the Incentive Plan). The earned bonus for each executive shall be subject to (i) downward (but not upward) discretionary adjustments, if any, as determined by the Compensation Committee, and (ii) any maximum bonus amount set forth in the Incentive Plan. The Compensation Committee will determine whether the performance objectives were reached after the end of the calendar year 2006, and any bonus payments will be made early in 2007.
