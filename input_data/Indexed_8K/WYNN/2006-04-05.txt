Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. The information set forth under Item 8.01 of this report is incorporated herein by reference. Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant. The information set forth under Item 8.01 of this report is incorporated herein by reference. Item 8.01. Other Events. On March 31, 2006, the lenders under the Wynn Las Vegas, LLC ("WLV") credit agreement approved the budget, plans and specifications for Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. WLV expects to start construction of Encore in the second quarter of 2006 and to open Encore to the public by the end of 2008. As previously disclosed, the project budget for Encore is approximately $1.74 billion. WLV expects that the remaining proceeds from its First Mortgage Notes, together with availability under its credit facilities and cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to pay for expenditures of up to $1.52 billion on the Encore project without incurring additional debt or receiving additional capital contributions from Wynn Resorts, Limited ("WRL"). Project costs exceeding $1.52 billion are currently expected to be financed with up to $100.0 million of additional indebtedness permitted under the Indenture governing our First Mortgage Notes and/or contributions from WRL. In connection with the approval of the Encore budget, plans and specifications, on March 31, 2006, WRL executed and delivered a Commitment to Pay Project Costs (the "Commitment") in favor of the lenders under the WLV credit agreement and the trustee for WLV's First Mortgage Notes. The Commitment requires WRL to pay project costs for Encore to the extent that WLV is otherwise unable to pay for such costs. The maximum obligation under the Commitment is $215,300,000, subject to downward adjustment, from time to time, to the extent other funds become available to pay for Encore project costs.
