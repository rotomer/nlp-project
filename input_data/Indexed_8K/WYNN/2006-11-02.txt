On October 27, 2006, Worldwide Wynn, LLC ("WW"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, Limited ("WRL"), entered into a new employment agreement with Linda Chen, WW's Chief Operating Officer. The agreement terminates Ms. Chen's previous employment agreement with WW, is effective as of August 1, 2006 and will terminate on August 1, 2011. The agreement provides for a base salary of $1,000,000 per year, which shall be subject to merit reviews on each anniversary date of the agreement and may be increased, but not decreased, as a result of such merit reviews. Ms. Chen will also be eligible to receive a bonus as determined in accordance with WRL's Annual Performance Based Incentive Plan for Executive Officers. Under the terms of the employment agreement, management of WW agreed to recommend to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of WRL (the "Compensation Committee") the following: (i) that Ms. Chen be granted 100,000 shares of restricted stock of WRL pursuant to the WRL 2002 Stock Incentive Plan; (ii) that such grant of restricted stock vest in its entirety six years after the date of grant; and (iii) that in the event Ms. Chen is terminated without "cause," the grant will vest pro rata on a monthly basis from the date of grant to the effective date of Ms. Chen's termination of employment. This grant of restricted stock has been approved by the Compensation Committee.
 
The agreement provides that Ms. Chen will be entitled to (i) participate, to the extent that she is otherwise eligible, in all employee benefit plans that WW maintains for its executives; and (ii) receive reimbursement for reasonable business expenses (including entertainment, promotional, gift and travel expenses and club memberships). Under the agreement, WW has agreed to provide Ms. Chen with housing for her and her immediate family while living in Macau and the use of an automobile in Macau.
 
If Ms. Chen is terminated without "cause," or if she terminates her employment upon a material breach of the agreement by WW, or for "good reason" following a "change of control" (as these terms are defined in the agreement), WW will pay Ms. Chen a separation payment in a lump sum equal to the sum of the following: (a) her base salary for the remainder of the term of the employment agreement, but not less than one year of her base salary; (b) a pro-rated amount of any bonus that might otherwise have been paid to Ms. Chen for any period that would have concluded during the remainder of the term of the employment agreement; and (c) a "gross-up" payment for excise taxes on the separation payment. Additionally, Ms. Chen will be entitled to receive, for the remainder of the term of the employment agreement, health benefits coverage for her and her dependents under the same plan(s) or arrangement(s) under which she was covered immediately before her termination, or plan(s) established or arrangement(s) provided by WW or any of its Affiliates thereafter.
 
If Ms. Chen's employment terminates for any other reason before the expiration of the term (e.g., because of her death, disability, discharge for cause or revocation of gaming license), WW will pay her only her base salary and any accrued but unpaid vacation pay through the termination date.
 
A copy of Ms. Chen's new employment agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1, and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
The information set forth in Item 1.01 is incorporated herein by reference. Concurrently with the execution of her new employment agreement with WW, Ms. Chen and WW terminated Ms. Chen's previous employment agreement with WW.
 
 
 
 
Ms. Chen's previous employment agreement with WW provided for a base salary of $600,000 per year, increasing to $750,000 per year upon the opening of the Wynn Macau casino resort; a guaranteed annual bonus of not less than $250,000 for the calendar year 2005, and thereafter as determined in accordance with WRL's Annual Performance Based Incentive Plan for Executive Officers; and the grant of an option to purchase 100,000 shares of common stock of WRL at $56.67 per share, which vested over five years, with 1/3 of the grant vesting on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant.

Employer and Employee hereby covenant and agree that, in order for Employee to discharge the duties required under this Agreement, Employee may be required to apply for or hold a license, registration, permit or other approval as issued by the Gaming Authorities pursuant to the terms of the applicable Gaming Laws and as otherwise required by this Agreement (the "
License
"). In the event Employee fails to apply for and secure, or the Gaming Authorities refuse to issue or renew, or revoke or suspend any required License, then Employee, at Employer's sole cost and expense, shall promptly defend such action and shall take such reasonable steps as may be required to either remove the objections, secure the Gaming Authorities' approval, or reinstate the License, respectively. The foregoing notwithstanding, if the source of the objections or the Gaming Authorities' refusal to renew the License or their imposition of disciplinary action against Employee is any of the events described in Subparagraph 1(d) of this Agreement,
 
11
 
 
then Employer's obligations under this paragraph 8 shall not be operative and Employee shall promptly reimburse Employer upon demand for any expenses incurred by Employer pursuant to this paragraph 8.
 
(c)
         
Employer and Employee hereby covenant and agree that the provisions of this paragraph 8 shall apply in the event Employee's duties require that Employee also be licensed by such relevant governmental agencies other than the Gaming Authorities.

Employee shall take all necessary and available precautions to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information, Trade Secrets, or Works of Authorship. Employee acknowledges and agrees that such Confidential Information, Trade Secrets, or Works of Authorship are the sole and exclusive property of Employer or its Affiliate.
 
(b)
        
Employee shall not remove from Employer's premises any Confidential Information, Trade Secrets, Works of Authorship, or any other documents pertaining to Employer's or its Affiliate's business, unless expressly authorized by Employer in writing. Furthermore, Employee specifically covenants and agrees not to make any duplicates, copies, or reconstructions of such materials and that, if any such duplicates, copies, or reconstructions are made, they shall become the property of Employer or its Affiliate upon their creation.
 
(c)
         
Upon termination of Employee's employment with Employer, Employee shall turn over to Employer the originals and all copies of any and all papers, documents and things, including information stored for use in or with computers and software, all files, Rolodex cards, phone books, notes, price lists, customer contracts, bids, customer lists, notebooks, books, memoranda, drawings, or other documents: (i) made, compiled by, or delivered to Employee concerning any customer served by Employer or its Affiliate or any product, apparatus, or process manufactured, used, developed or investigated by Employer; (ii) containing any Confidential Information, Trade Secret or Work of Authorship; or (iii) otherwise relating to Employee's performance of duties under this Agreement. Employee further acknowledges and agrees that all such documents are the sole and exclusive property of Employer or its Affiliate.
 
(d)
         
Employee hereby warrants, covenants and agrees that Employee shall not disclose to Employer, or any Affiliate, officer, director, employee or agent of Employer, any proprietary or confidential information or property, including but not limited
 
12
 
 
to any trade secret, formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique or process, which Employee is prohibited by contract, or otherwise, to disclose to Employer (the "
Restricted Information
"). In the event, Employer requests Restricted Information from Employee, Employee shall advise Employer that the information requested is Restricted Information and may not be disclosed by Employee.
 
(e)
         
The obligations of this paragraph 9 are continuing and shall survive the termination of Employee's employment with Employer.
 
 
(a)
         
Employee hereby covenants and agrees that, during the remainder of the Term, notwithstanding a termination of this Agreement under paragraph 6, Employee shall not directly or indirectly, either as a principal, agent, employee, employer, consultant, partner, member of a limited liability company, shareholder of a closely held corporation, or shareholder in excess of two percent (2%) of a publicly traded corporation, corporate officer or director, or in any other individual or representative capacity, engage or otherwise participate in any manner or fashion in any gaming or hotel business that is in competition in any manner whatsoever with the principal business activity of Employer or Employer's Affiliates, in or about any market in which Employer or Employer's Affiliates have or have publicly announced a plan for gaming or hotel operations. Employee hereby further covenants and agrees that the restrictive covenant contained in this paragraph 11 is reasonable as to duration, terms and geographical area and that the same protects the legitimate interests of Employer, imposes no undue hardship on Employee, and is not injurious to the public.
 
(b)
         
Employee hereby further covenants and agrees that, for the period described in Subparagraph 10(a), Employee shall not directly or indirectly, and Employee shall not suffer others to, solicit or attempt to solicit for employment any management level employee of Employer or Employer's Affiliates with or on behalf of any business that is in competition in any manner whatsoever with the principal business activity of Employer or Employer's Affiliates, in or about any market in which Employer or Employer's Affiliates have or plan gaming or hotel operations.

EXHIBIT 1
 
Indemnification and Gross-Up for Excise Taxes
 
(a)
        
Employer shall indemnify and hold Employee harmless from and against any and all liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, attorney's fees and costs) which Employee may incur as a result of the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or any similar provision of state or local income tax law (the "Excise Tax"), to the end that Employee shall be placed in the same tax position with respect to the Severance Payment under Employee's Employment Agreement and all other payments from Employer to Employee in the nature of compensation as Employee would have been in if the Excise Tax had never been enacted. In furtherance of such indemnification, Employer shall pay to Employee a payment (the "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that, after payment by Employee of all taxes, including income taxes and the Excise Tax imposed on the Gross-Up Payment and any interest or penalties (other than interest and penalties imposed by reason of Employee's failure to file timely tax returns or to pay taxes shown due on such returns and any tax liability, including interest and penalties, unrelated to the Excise Tax or the Gross-Up Amount), Employee shall be placed in the same tax position with respect to the Severance Payment under this Plan and all other payments from Employer to Employee in the nature of compensation as Employee would have been in if the Excise Tax had never been enacted. When Employer pays Employee's Severance Payment, it shall also pay to Employee a Gross-Up Payment for the Severance Payment and any other payments in the nature of compensation that Employer determines are "excess parachute payments" under Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code ("Excess Parachute Payments"). If, through a determination of the Internal Revenue Service or any state or local taxing authority (a "Taxing Authority"), or a judgment of any court, Employee becomes liable for an amount of Excise Tax not covered by the Gross-Up Payment payable pursuant to the preceding sentence, Employer shall pay Employee an additional Gross-Up Payment to make Employee whole for such additional Excise Tax; provided, however, that, pursuant to Section (c) of this Exhibit 1, Employer shall have the right to require Employee to protest, contest, or appeal any such determination or judgment. For purposes of this Exhibit 1, any amount that Employer is required to withhold under Sections 3402 or 4999 of the Code or under any other provision of law shall be deemed to have been paid to Employee.
(b)
        
Upon payment to Employee of a Gross-Up Payment, Employer shall provide Employee with a written statement showing Employer's computation of such Gross-Up Payment and the Excess Parachute Payments and Excise Tax to which it relates, and setting forth Employer's determination of the amount of gross income Employee is required to recognize as a result of such payments and Employee's liability for the Excise Tax. Employee shall cause his or her federal, state, and local income tax returns for the period in which Employee receive such Gross-Up Payment to be prepared and filed in accordance with such statement, and, upon such filing, Employee shall certify in writing to Employer that such returns have been so prepared and filed.
 
16
 
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section (a) of this Exhibit 1, Employer shall not be obligated to indemnify Employee from and against any tax liability, cost or expense (including, without limitation, any liability for the Excise Tax or attorney's fees or costs) to the extent such tax liability, cost or expense is attributable to your failure to comply with the provisions of this Section (b).
(c)
        
If any controversy arises between Employee and a Taxing Authority with respect to the treatment on any return of the Gross-Up Amount, or of any payment Employee receives from Employer as an Excess Parachute Payment, or with respect to any return which a Taxing Authority asserts should show an Excess Parachute Payment, including, without limitation, any audit, protest to an appeals authority of a Taxing Authority or litigation (a "Controversy"), Employer shall have the right to participate with Employee in the handling of such Controversy. Employer shall have the right, solely with respect to a Controversy, to direct Employee to protest or contest any proposed adjustment or deficiency, initiate an appeals procedure within any Taxing Authority, commence any judicial proceeding, make any settlement agreement, or file a claim for refund of tax, and Employee shall not take any of such steps without the prior written approval of Employer, which Employer shall not unreasonably withhold. If Employer so elects, Employee shall be represented in any Controversy by attorneys, accountants, and other advisors selected by Employer, and Employer shall pay the fees, costs and expenses of such attorneys, accountants, or advisors, and any tax liability Employee may incur as a result of such payment. Employee shall promptly notify Employer of any communication with a Taxing Authority, and Employee shall promptly furnish to Employer copies of any written correspondence, notices, or documents received from a Taxing Authority relating to a Controversy. Employee shall cooperate fully with Employer in the handling of any Controversy by furnishing Employer any information or documentation relating to or bearing upon the Controversy;
provided
,
however
, that Employee shall not be obligated to furnish to Employer copies of any portion of his or her tax returns which do not bear upon, and are not affected by, the Controversy.
(d)
        
Employee shall pay over to Employer, within ten (10) days after receipt thereof, any refund Employee receive from any Taxing Authority of all or any portion of the Gross-Up Payment or the Excise Tax, together with any interest Employee receive from such Taxing Authority on such refund. For purposes of this Section (d), a reduction in Employee's tax liability attributable to the previous payment of the Gross-Up Amount or the Excise Tax shall be deemed to be a refund. If Employee would have received a refund of all or any portion of the Gross-Up Payment or the Excise Tax, except that a Taxing Authority offset the amount of such refund against other tax liabilities, interest, or penalties, Employee shall pay the amount of such offset over to Employer, together with the amount of interest Employee would have received from the Taxing Authority if such offset had been an actual refund, within ten (10) days after receipt of notice from the Taxing Authority of such offset.
