Wynn Resorts, Limited announced today that its wholly owned subsidiary, Wynn Resorts (Macau), S.A., will open the previously announced expansion of Wynn Macau in one phase in the third quarter of 2007, rather than in stages throughout the year. This change is a result of continued planning for the Diamond Suites tower at Wynn Macau that was announced in November 2006 and the integration of this new tower with Wynn Macau.
The expansion, including approximately 135,000 square feet of additional gaming space, is expected to open simultaneously with the new front feature and additional food, beverage and retail amenities, in the third quarter of 2007. While the table games and slot machines originally slated for opening in February will now open in July, we will open a total of approximately 40 additional table games and 266 additional slot machines for Chinese New Year, resulting in a total of 264 table games and 632 slot machines at Wynn Macau. After completion of the expansion in July, Wynn Macau is expected to have a total of approximately 420 table games and 1,280 slot machines.
