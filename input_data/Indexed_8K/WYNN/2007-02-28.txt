Exhibit 99.1
 
Wynn Resorts, Limited Reports Fourth Quarter Results
 
Wynn Las Vegas generates adjusted EBITDA of $101.2 million in the fourth quarter and $332.8 million in the fiscal year ended 2006
 
Wynn Macau generates adjusted EBITDA of $58.5 million in the fourth quarter and $60.8 million in the 117 days since its September 6, 2006 opening
 
LAS VEGAS, February 27, 2007 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Wynn Resorts, Limited (Nasdaq: WYNN) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006.
 
Highlights from 2006
 
Net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $563.6 million, compared to $269.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Results for this quarter include a full quarter of operations for Wynn Macau, which opened on September 6, 2006. Net revenues for 2006 were $1.4 billion, a 98.5% increase over 2005. The revenue increase was driven primarily by the opening of Wynn Macau in 2006 and a full year of operations for Wynn Las Vegas (versus 248 days in 2005).
 
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (2) was $159.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to $80.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Adjusted EBITDA for 2006 was $393.6 million, an 85.6% increase compared to 2005.
 
On a US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) basis, net income for the year was $628.7 million, or $6.24 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $90.8 million, or ($0.92) per diluted share in 2005. The significant increase in net income was due to the completion of the $900 million sale of the subconcession right in Macau in the third quarter of 2006.
 
On a US GAAP basis, net loss for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $55.4 million, or ($0.55) per diluted share, compared to a loss of $9.9 million, or ($0.10) per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2005. The main reason for the decline relates to the special distribution paid to convertible debenture holders on December 4, 2006. Adjusted net income in the fourth quarter of 2006 was $57.1 million, or $0.53 per diluted share (adjusted EPS)(1) compared to an adjusted net income of $6.5 million, or $0.08 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2005.
 
Wynn Las Vegas Fourth Quarter Results
For the quarter ended December 31, 2006, Wynn Las Vegas generated adjusted EBITDA of $101.2 million, a 26.4% increase from the fourth quarter of 2005, with a 32.1% EBITDA margin on net revenue.
Net casino revenues in the fourth quarter of 2006 were $163.7 million, compared to $131.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2005. Table games drop was $515.5 million, with win per table per day (before discounts) of $10,803, compared to drop of $499.5 million and win per table per day of $8,842 in the fourth quarter of 2005. Table games win percentage of 26.3% was above the property's expected range of 20% to 23% and exceeded the 21.3% for the fourth quarter of 2005. Slot machine win per unit per day was $256 on handle (volume) of $1.1 billion in the quarter compared to a win per unit per day of $256 on handle of $882.7 million during the comparable period of 2005. Slot handle increased during the fourth quarter of 2006 as compared to 2005, however, during the fourth quarter of 2006, the slot win percentage was slightly less than the expected range of 5% to 6% while the hold percentage in the fourth quarter of 2005 fell within the normalized range.

Gross non-casino revenues for the quarter were $191.3 million, a 7.6% increase from the fourth quarter of 2005. Hotel revenues were up 3.5% to $66.5 million during the quarter, versus $64.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Wynn Las Vegas achieved an Average Daily Rate (ADR) of $291 for the quarter, compared to $278 in the fourth quarter of 2005. The property's occupancy was 91.6% compared to 92.5% during the prior year period, generating revenue per available room (REVPAR) of $266 in the 2006 period (3.3% higher than in 2005).
Food and beverage revenues increased 14.3% to $73.6 million in the quarter compared to $64.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, primarily from increased revenues from Wynn Las Vegas' Tryst nightclub. Retail revenues were $23.7 million in the quarter, compared to $17.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, an increase of 36.8%. Entertainment revenues were approximately $14.7 million, compared to $19.5 in the fourth quarter of 2005, a decrease of 25% from 2005 due primarily to the closing of Avenue Q in May 2006.
Wynn Las Vegas Full Year 2006 Operating Results
For the full year 2006, Wynn Las Vegas generated adjusted EBITDA of $332.8 million, representing a 29.2% margin on net revenues.
Net casino revenues were $535.6 million. Table games drop was $1.9 billion and table games win percentage was 22.1% (within the expected range of 20% to 23%). Slot machine win per unit per day was $251 on handle (volume) of $3.9 billion. Our slot win percentage for the year ended December 31, 2006, was slightly below the expected range of 5% to 6%, while in 2005 it was within the range.
Gross non-casino revenues for the period were $758.0 million and net non-gaming revenues were $603.8 million. Wynn Las Vegas' room revenues were $268.2 million. Average daily rate (ADR) was $287 and occupancy was 94.4%, generating revenue per available room (REVPAR) of $271 for 2006. Revenues from food and beverage were $295.2 million and the retail, entertainment and other departments generated gross revenues of $79.3 million, $66.3 million and $49.0 million, respectively. Food and beverage revenues in 2006 benefited from the property's nightclub, Tryst.
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas
We are constructing Encore on approximately 20 acres on the Las Vegas Strip, immediately adjacent to Wynn Las Vegas. Encore's current plans include 2,034 units ranging in size and amenities from executive suites to duplex sky villas and penthouses, an approximately 72,000 square foot casino, additional convention and meeting space, as well as restaurants, a nightclub, swimming pools, a spa and salon and retail outlets. The property is expected to open in early 2009.
 
Our project budget is currently estimated at approximately $2.1 billion, consisting of approximately $2.0 billion for Encore and approximately $100 million for an employee parking garage on our Koval property, an associated pedestrian bridge and costs incurred in connection with the theatre remodeling and production of "Monty Python's Spamalot" at Wynn Las Vegas.  On February 27, 2007, we entered into a Design Build Architectural, Engineering and Construction Services Agreement with Tutor-Saliba Corporation for the design and construction of Encore. The contract sets forth all of the terms and conditions pursuant to which Tutor-Saliba will design and construct Encore. The Contract also provides that the parties will negotiate a guaranteed maximum price ("GMP) for the construction and design of Encore within 90 days of execution of the Contract. If the parties cannot mutually agree upon a GMP during the 90 day period, the Company can continue to employ Tutor for construction and design services on a cost-plus basis, agree to alternative arrangements with Tutor or terminate the Contract.
 
As of December 31, 2006, the Company had incurred approximately $277.6 million of project costs related to the development and construction of Encore and related capital improvements.
 
Wynn Macau Fourth Quarter Results
The first phase of Wynn Macau opened on September 6, 2006 with 220 tables, 380 slot machines and 600 hotel rooms. In the fourth quarter of 2006, Wynn Macau generated net revenues (after discounts and commissions) of $248.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $58.5 million.
 
Table games results in Macau are segregated into two distinct reporting categories, the mass market segment and the VIP segment.

Wynn Macau Expansion
 
In February 2007, we added additional table games and slot machines bringing the current total to approximately 256 table games and approximately 477 slot machines in an approximately 110,000 square foot casino. Construction on the second phase is progressing as planned and is expected to open in the third quarter of 2007. This second phase includes approximately 123,000 square feet of additional gaming space, a dramatic front feature attraction and additional food, beverage, a theater showroom and retail amenities. After the completion of this expansion, Wynn Macau is expected to have a total of approximately 420 table games and 1,280 slot machines.
 
In addition, we continue to develop the plans and budget for Wynn Diamond Suites, a further expansion of Wynn Macau, which was first announced in November 2006. This further expansion is expected to add a second self-contained, fully-integrated resort as well as food and beverage, retail and entertainment amenities. We continue to work on a budget and final design for Wynn Diamond Suites.
 
As of December 31, 2006, we have incurred approximately $877.1 million of a total project budget (excluding Wynn Diamond Suites) of approximately $1.2 billion.
 
Cotai
 
The Company has submitted an application to the Macau government for a concession of land in Cotai for future development. The Company recently reconfigured its site plans for 52 acres and is waiting final approval.

Interest expense, net of $5.8 million in capitalized interest, was $39.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2006. For the full year 2006, interest expense was $148.0 million, net of $29.5 million in capitalized interest. Depreciation and amortization expenses were $50.7 million during the quarter.

Forward-looking Statements
This release contains forward-looking statements regarding operating trends and future results of operations. Such forward-looking information involves important risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect anticipated results in the future and, accordingly, such results may differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, competition in the casino/hotel and resorts industries, the Company's brief operating history, the Company's dependence on existing management, levels of travel, leisure and casino spending, general domestic or international economic conditions, and changes in gaming laws or regulations. Additional information concerning potential factors that could affect the Company's financial results is included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 and the Company's other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company is under no obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligation to) update its forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures
(1) Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share ("EPS") are presented exclusively as supplemental disclosures because management believes that these financial measures are widely used to measure the performance, and as a principal basis for valuation, of gaming companies. These measures are considered by some to be a better indicator on which to base expectations of future results than income or EPS computed in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
(2) "Adjusted EBITDA" is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, pre-opening costs, property charges and other, contract termination fee, corporate expenses, stock-based compensation, and other non-operating income and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors. The Company also presents Adjusted EBITDA because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a company's ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDA as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with GAAP. In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including Wynn Resorts, Limited, have historically excluded from their EBITDA calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges and corporate expenses, which do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. However, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Company's performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Unlike net income, Adjusted EBITDA does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. We compensate for these limitations by using Adjusted EBITDA as only one of several comparative tools, together with GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. Such GAAP measurements include operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operations and cash flow data. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA. Also, Wynn Resorts' calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
The Company has included schedules in the tables that accompany this release that reconcile (i) net income and net income (loss) per share to adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share, and (ii) operating income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss).

(1) ADR is Average Daily Room Rate and is calculated by dividing total room revenue (less service charges, if any) by total rooms occupied.
(2) APR is Average Paying Rate and is calculated by dividing cash room revenue by cash rooms occupied.
(3) REVPAR is Revenue per Available Room and is calculated by dividing total room revenue by total rooms available.
(4) Table games win per unit per day is shown before discounts and commissions.
(5) Slot machine win per unit per day is net of participation fees and progressive accruals.
(6) Information for the 2005 and 2006 twelve-month periods as well as 2005 three-month period is not meaningful as Wynn Macau opened on September 6, 2006 and Wynn Las Vegas was opened for 248 days in 2005.
