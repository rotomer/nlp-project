The Amended and Restated Disbursement Agreement, among other things, sets forth terms and conditions with respect to Wynn Las Vegas' use of funds in certain of its accounts (including for the purpose of paying project costs), the completion of the Encore at Wynn Las Vegas ("Encore") and Wynn Las Vegas' ability to amend the budget, schedule, and contracts related to the construction of Encore. Furthermore, the Amended and Restated Disbursement Agreement requires Wynn Las Vegas to deliver status reports, costs reports, the budget and the schedule related to the construction of Encore and to certify as to the availability of funds necessary to complete construction of Encore, each on a quarterly basis. Failure to deliver such items or make such certifications, or the failure or inability to open or complete Encore by
 
a specified opening or completion date, may result in a default or event of default under the Amended and Restated Disbursement Agreement, in which case Wynn Las Vegas may be prohibited from accessing funds pursuant to Wynn Las Vegas' Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of August 15, 2006 (as amended to date, the "Credit Agreement") or making payments of project costs for Encore. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the Amended and Restated Disbursement Agreement, the agent for the lenders under the Credit Agreement and the disbursement agent under the Amended and Restated Disbursement Agreement will be entitled to refuse to make extensions of credit pursuant to the Credit Agreement or make or allow any payments or disbursements for the payment of project costs. The Amended and Restated Disbursement Agreement provides that the agent for the lenders under the Credit Agreement, without the consent of any person, is entitled to waive defaults and events of default under the Amended and Restated Disbursement Agreement.
The foregoing description of the Amended and Restated Disbursement Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Amended and Restated Disbursement Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
