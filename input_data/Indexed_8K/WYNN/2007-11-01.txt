% First Mortgage Notes. The notes will be senior secured obligations of the issuers, will be guaranteed by Wynn Las Vegas, LLC's subsidiaries (subject to some exceptions), and will be secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the existing and future assets of the issuers and guarantors.
The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or under any state securities laws. Therefore, the issuers may not offer or sell the notes within the United States to, or for the account or benefit of, any United States person unless the offer or sale would qualify for a registration exemption from the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. The issuers have agreed to make an offer to exchange the notes for registered, publicly traded notes that have substantially identical terms as the notes.

Such forward-looking information involves important risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect anticipated results in the future and, accordingly, such results may differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by Wynn Resorts, Limited or the issuers. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, competition in the casino/hotel and resorts industries, the issuers' brief operating history, the issuers' dependence on existing management, levels of travel, leisure and casino spending, general domestic or international economic conditions, and changes in gaming laws or regulations.
