Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On November 7, 2007, Wynn International Marketing Limited Hong Kong Branch (WIML) an Isle of Man company registered as a foreign branch in Hong Kong and wholly owned subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, Limited (WRL), entered into an amended employment agreement with Ian Michael Coughlan, the President and General Manager of Wynn Resorts (Macau) SA. The agreement supersedes and replaces Mr. Coughlans previous employment agreement with WIML dated as of September 6, 2006, and is effective as of July 4, 2007. The agreement terminates on July 6, 2012. The agreement provides for a base salary of US$750,000 per year and a discretionary bonus of up to 100% of base salary for 2007. Starting in 2008, Mr. Coughlan will be eligible to receive a bonus as determined in accordance with WRLs Annual Performance Based Incentive Plan for Executive Officers.
The agreement provides that Mr. Coughlan will be entitled to (i) participate, to the extent that he is otherwise eligible, in all employee benefit plans that WIML maintains for its executives; and (ii) receive reimbursement for reasonable business expenses. Under the agreement, WIML has agreed to provide Mr. Coughlan with a housing allowance for himself and his immediate family while living in Macau and the use of an automobile in Macau.
If Mr. Coughlan is terminated without cause, or if he terminates his employment upon a material breach of the agreement by WIML, or for good reason following a change of control (as these terms are defined in the agreement), WIML will pay Mr. Coughlan a separation payment in a lump sum equal to the sum of the following: (a) his base salary for the remainder of the term of the employment agreement, but not less than one year of his base salary; and (b) a pro-rated amount of any bonus that might otherwise have been paid to Mr. Coughlan for any period that would have concluded during the remainder of the term of the agreement. Additionally, Mr. Coughlan will be entitled to receive, for the remainder of the term of the employment agreement, health benefits coverage for himself and his dependents under the same plan(s) or arrangement(s) under which he was covered immediately before his termination, or plan(s) established or arrangement(s) provided by WIML or any of its affiliates thereafter.
If Mr. Coughlans employment terminates for any other reason before the expiration of the term (e.g., because of his death, disability, discharge for cause or revocation of gaming license), WIML will pay him only his base salary and any accrued but unpaid vacation pay through the termination date.
