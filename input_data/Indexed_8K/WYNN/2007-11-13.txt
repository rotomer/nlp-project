Additional Notes
On November 6, 2007, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC ("Wynn Las Vegas") and Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp. ("Capital Corp." and, together with Wynn Las Vegas, the "Issuers"), each a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, Limited ("WRL"), issued $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of their 6-5/8% First Mortgage Notes due 2014 (the "Additional Notes"). The Additional Notes were issued under the same indenture as the 6-5/8% First Mortgage Notes previously issued by the Issuers (the "Original Notes" and, together with the Additional Notes, the "First Mortgage Notes").
The Additional Notes are pari passu with, and will vote on any matter submitted to noteholders with, the Original Notes. However, because the Additional Notes were issued with more than de minimis original issue discount, the Additional Notes are not fungible with the Original Notes.
The Issuers may redeem all or a portion of the First Mortgage Notes at any time on or after December 1, 2009 at a premium decreasing ratably to zero, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, prior to December 1, 2007, the Issuers may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the First Mortgage Notes at a redemption price of 106.625% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with the net proceeds of one or more qualified equity contributions made to the Issuers by WRL. If the Issuers undergo a change of control the Issuers must offer to repurchase the First Mortgage Notes at 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. If the Issuers sell certain assets or suffer an event of loss and the Issuers do not use the sale or insurance proceeds for specified purposes, the Issuers must offer to repurchase the First Mortgage Notes at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The First Mortgage Notes are also subject to mandatory redemption requirements imposed by gaming laws and regulations of gaming authorities in Nevada.
The First Mortgage Notes will be the Issuers' senior secured obligations and will rank pari passu in right of payment with borrowings under Wynn Las Vegas' credit facilities. The First Mortgage Notes are secured on an equal and ratable basis (with certain exceptions) by a first priority lien on substantially all of the Issuers' existing and future assets, the same collateral that secures Wynn Las Vegas' borrowings under its credit facilities. The first priority lien securing the First Mortgage Notes may be released in whole, or in part, under certain circumstances. An amended and restated intercreditor agreement imposes restrictions on the exercise of rights and remedies by the noteholders with respect to the collateral.
The First Mortgage Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by all of the Issuers' subsidiaries except Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC (the "Guarantors"). The guarantees of the First Mortgage Notes are secured on an equal and ratable basis by a first priority lien on substantially all of the Guarantors' assets, the same collateral that secures the guarantees under Wynn Las Vegas' credit facilities.
The Issuers have agreed to make an offer to exchange the Additional Notes for registered, publicly tradable notes that have substantially identical terms as the Additional Notes (see "Registration Rights Agreement" below). The Issuers expect that the Additional Notes will be eligible for trading in the Private Offerings, Resales and Trading through Automated Linkages system of NASDAQ.
A
mendment to Disbursement Agreement
On November 6, 2007, in connection with the issuance of the Additional Notes, Wynn Las Vegas entered into a second amendment (the "Second Amendment") to its Amended and Restated Master Disbursement Agreement, dated as of October 25, 2007, as amended by a First Amendment thereto, dated as of October 31, 2007 (as so amended, the "Disbursement Agreement"), by and among Wynn Las Vegas, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as bank agent, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as disbursement agent. The Second Amendment makes certain technical changes to the Disbursement Agreement in connection with the issuance of the Additional Notes. Among other things, because the proceeds of the Additional Notes are available for the construction of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, the Second Amendment eliminates the ability of Wynn Las Vegas to characterize certain unutilized capacity for the issuance of unsecured debt as available to pay costs associated with such construction.
The foregoing description of the Second Amendment is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Second Amendment, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Registration Rights Agreement
Also on November 6, 2007, in connection with the issuance of the Additional Notes, the Issuers entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), by and among the Issuers, the Guarantors, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC.
Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Issuers and the Guarantors agreed to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") exchange notes (the "Exchange Notes") having substantially identical terms as the Additional Notes, as part of an offer to exchange freely tradable Exchange Notes for the Additional Notes. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Issuers and the Guarantors agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC with respect to the exchange offer within 120 days after November 6, 2007 and to use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement to be declared effective within 240 days after November 6, 2007. The Issuers and the Guarantors have also agreed to file a shelf registration statement for the resale of the Additional Notes if they cannot complete an exchange offer within the time periods listed above and in certain other circumstances. The Issuers and the Guarantors may be required to pay liquidated damages if they fail to comply with the registration and exchange requirements set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement.
The foregoing description of the Registration Rights Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Registration Rights Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The information set forth in Item 1.01 is incorporated herein by reference.

Because such Broker-Dealer may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Act and must, therefore, deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Act in connection with its initial sale of any Additional Exchange Notes received by such Broker-Dealer in the Exchange Offer, the Issuers and Guarantors shall permit the use of the Prospectus
 
contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement by such Broker-Dealer to satisfy such prospectus delivery requirement. To the extent necessary to ensure that the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is available for sales of Additional Exchange Notes by Broker-Dealers, the Issuers and the Guarantors agree to use all commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement continuously effective, supplemented, amended and current as required by and subject to (i) the provisions of Section 6(a) and (c) hereof and (ii) any applicable Suspension Period, and in conformity with the requirements of this Agreement, the Act and the policies, rules and regulations of the Commission as announced from time to time, for a period of 180 days from the Consummation Deadline or such shorter period as will terminate when all Transfer Restricted Securities covered by such Registration Statement have been sold pursuant thereto; , , that if the Exchange Offer Registration Statement ceases to be effective during any Suspension Period, such 180-day period shall be extended by the number of days such Suspension Period is in effect.

To the extent necessary to ensure that the Shelf Registration Statement is available for sales of Transfer Restricted Securities by the Holders thereof entitled to the benefit of this Section 4(a) and the other securities required to be registered therein pursuant to Section 6(b)(ii) hereof, the Issuers and the Guarantors shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to keep any Shelf Registration Statement required by this Section 4(a) continuously effective, supplemented, amended and current as required by and subject to (i) the provisions of Sections 6(b) and (c) hereof and (ii) any applicable Suspension Period, and in conformity with the requirements of this Agreement, the Act and the policies, rules and regulations of the Commission as announced from time to time, for a period of at least two years, or one year if such Shelf Registration Statement is filed at the request of a Holder or Holders, (in each case, as such time may be extended pursuant to Section 6(d) hereof) following the Closing Date, or such shorter period as will terminate when all Transfer Restricted Securities covered by such Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant thereto or when all Additional Notes cease to be Transfer Restricted Securities.

No Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities shall be entitled to liquidated damages pursuant to Section 5 hereof unless and until such Holder shall have provided all such information. Each selling Holder agrees to promptly furnish additional information as requested by the Commission or as required to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the Issuers by such Holder not materially misleading.

The relative fault of the Issuers and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and of the Holder, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such Issuer or such Guarantor, on the one hand, or by the Holder, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(a), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
The Issuers, the Guarantors and each Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any matter, including any action that could have given rise to such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Holder, its directors, its officers or any Person, if any, who controls such Holder shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the total received by such Holder with respect to the sale of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds (i) the amount paid by such Holder for such Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(c) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities held by each Holder hereunder and not joint.
 
SECTION 9. RULE 144A AND RULE 144
Each Issuer and each Guarantor agrees with each Holder, for so long as any Transfer Restricted Securities remain outstanding and during any period in which such Issuer and such Guarantor (i) is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to make available, upon request of any Holder, to such Holder or beneficial owner of Transfer Restricted Securities in connection with any sale thereof and any prospective purchaser of such Transfer Restricted Securities designated by such Holder or beneficial owner, the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Act in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144A, and (ii) is subject to Section 13 or 15 (d) of the Exchange Act, to make all filings required thereby in a timely manner in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144.
SECTION 10. MISCELLANEOUS
(a) . The Issuers and the Guarantors acknowledge and agree that any failure by the Issuers and/or the Guarantors to comply with their respective obligations under Sections 3 and 4 hereof may result in material irreparable injury to the Initial Purchasers or the Holders for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Initial Purchasers or any Holder may obtain such relief as may be required to specifically enforce the Issuers' and the Guarantor's obligations under Sections 3 and 4 hereof. The Issuers and the Guarantors further agree to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate.
Remedies
(b) . Neither of the Issuers nor any Guarantor will, on or after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. The Issuers and the Guarantors represent and warrant to the Holders and the Initial Purchasers that the rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of the Issuers' and the Guarantors' securities under any agreement in effect on the date hereof.
No Inconsistent Agreements
(c) . The provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to or departures from the provisions hereof may not be given unless (i) in the case of Section 5 hereof and this Section 10(c)(i), the Issuers have obtained the written consent of Holders of all outstanding Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) in the case of all other provisions hereof, the Issuers have obtained the written consent of Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities (excluding Transfer Restricted Securities held by the Issuers or their Affiliates). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to or departure from the provisions hereof that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose Transfer Restricted Securities are being tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer, and that does not affect, directly or indirectly, the rights of other Holders whose Transfer Restricted Securities are not being tendered pursuant to such Exchange Offer, may be given by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities subject to such Exchange Offer.
