LAS VEGAS, February 12, 2008 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Wynn Resorts, Limited (Nasdaq: WYNN) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2007.
Highlights from 2007
 
Net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $711.3 million, compared to $563.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Net revenues for 2007 were $2.7 billion, an 87.6% increase over 2006. The revenue increase was driven primarily by the ramp up in our operations in Macau and strong performance in Las Vegas.

Net income for 2006 was positively influenced by approximately $741.9 million due to the completion of the sale of a subconcession in Macau, a non-recurring item. Adjusted net income for 2007 was $329.4 million, or $2.97 per diluted share (adjusted EPS)(2) compared to an adjusted net income of $49.4 million, or $0.53 per diluted share in 2006.
On a US GAAP basis, net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $65.5 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $55.4 million, or ($0.55) per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2006.

Forward-looking Statements
 
This release contains forward-looking statements regarding operating trends and future results of operations.  Such forward-looking information involves important risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect anticipated results in the future and, accordingly, such results may differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, competition in the casino/hotel and resorts industries, the Companys brief operating history, the Companys dependence on existing management, levels of travel, leisure and casino spending, general domestic or international economic conditions, and changes in gaming laws or regulations. Additional information concerning potential factors that could affect the Company's financial results is included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 and the Company's other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company is under no obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligation to) update its forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures
 
(1) Adjusted property EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening costs, property charges and other, corporate expenses, stock-based compensation, contract termination fee, and other non-operating income and expenses.  Adjusted property EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses adjusted property EBITDA as a measure of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors.  The Company also presents adjusted property EBITDA because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a companys ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements.  Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDA as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including Wynn Resorts, Limited, have historically excluded from their EBITDA calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges and corporate expenses, that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties.  However, adjusted property EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Companys performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.  Unlike net income, adjusted property EBITDA does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital.  The Company compensates for these limitations by using adjusted property EBITDA as only one of several comparative tools, together with GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance.  Such GAAP measurements include operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operations and cash flow data. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in adjusted property EBITDA.  Also, Wynn Resorts calculation of adjusted property EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
 
The Company has included schedules in the tables that accompany this release that reconcile (i) net income to adjusted net income (loss), and (ii) operating income (loss) to adjusted property EBITDA and adjusted property EBITDA to net income.
 
(2) Adjusted net income is net income before pre-opening costs, property charges and other, and other non-cash non-operating income and expenses.  Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share (EPS) are presented as supplemental disclosures because management believes that these financial measures are widely used to measure the performance, and as a principal basis for valuation, of gaming companies. These measures are used by management and/orevaluated by some investors, in addition to income and EPS computed in accordance with GAAP, as an additional basis for assessing period-to-period results of our business. Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.

Note: *
 
Diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 include the assumption that the convertible subordinated debentures were converted into shares of common stock.  Accordingly, net income used in the computation of diluted earnings per share is increased by approximately $5.1 million and $9.4 million, of net interest attributable to these debentures for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 and the cash distribution of $58.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Note: *Diluted adjusted net income per share for the three months ended December 31, 2006 and the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, includes the assumption that the convertible debentures were converted into shares of common stock.  Since the convertible debentures were all converted into shares of stock in July 2007, there is no adjustment to net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2007.  Accordingly, adjusted net income used in the computation of diluted adjusted net income per share for the three months ended December 31, 2006 and the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, is increased by approximately $2.3 million, $5.1 million and $9.4 million, respectively, of net interest attributable to these debentures.
