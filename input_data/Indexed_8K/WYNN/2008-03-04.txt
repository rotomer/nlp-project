In furtherance of such indemnification, Employer shall pay to Employee a payment (the "") in an amount such that, after payment by Employee of all taxes, including income taxes and the Excise Tax imposed on the Gross-Up Payment and any interest or penalties (other than interest and penalties imposed by reason of Employee's failure to file timely tax returns or to pay taxes shown due on such returns and any tax liability, including interest and penalties, unrelated to the Excise Tax or the Gross-Up Amount), Employee shall be placed in the same tax position with respect to the Severance Payment under this Plan and all other payments from Employer to Employee in the nature of compensation as Employee would have been in if the Excise Tax had never been enacted. When Employer pays Employee's Severance Payment, it shall also pay to Employee a Gross-Up Payment for the Severance Payment and any other payments in the nature of compensation that Employer determines are "excess parachute payments" under Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code ("").

IN WITNESS WHEREOF AND INTENDING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND THEREBY,
 
 
(a) Employer shall indemnify and hold Employee harmless from and against any and all liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, attorney's fees and costs) which Employee may incur as a result of the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or any similar provision of state or local income tax law (the "Excise Tax"), to the end that Employee shall be placed in the same tax position with respect to the Severance Payment under Employee's Employment Agreement and all other payments from Employer to Employee in the nature of compensation as Employee would have been in if the Excise Tax had never been enacted. In furtherance of such indemnification, Employer shall pay to Employee a payment (the "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that, after payment by Employee of all taxes, including income taxes and the Excise Tax imposed on the Gross-Up Payment and any interest or penalties (other than interest and penalties imposed by reason of Employee's failure to file timely tax returns or to pay taxes shown due on such returns and any tax liability, including interest and penalties, unrelated to the Excise Tax or the Gross-Up Amount), Employee shall be placed in the same tax position with respect to the Severance Payment under this Plan and all other payments from Employer to Employee in the nature of compensation as Employee would have been in if the Excise Tax had never been enacted. When Employer pays Employee's Severance Payment, it shall also pay to Employee a Gross-Up Payment for the Severance Payment and any other payments in the nature of compensation that Employer determines are "excess parachute payments" under Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code ("Excess Parachute Payments"). If, through a determination of the Internal Revenue Service or any state or local taxing authority (a "Taxing Authority"), or a judgment of any court, Employee becomes liable for an amount of Excise Tax not covered by the Gross-Up Payment payable pursuant to the preceding sentence, Employer shall pay Employee an additional Gross-Up Payment to make Employee whole for such additional Excise Tax; provided, however, that, pursuant to Section 2.3(c), Employer shall have the right to require Employee to protest, contest, or appeal any such determination or judgment. For purposes of this Section 2.3, any amount that Employer is required to withhold under Sections 3402 or 4999 of the Code or under any other provision of law shall be deemed to have been paid to Employee.
(b) Upon payment to Employee of a Gross-Up Payment, Employer shall provide Employee with a written statement showing Employer's computation of such Gross-Up Payment and the Excess Parachute Payments and Excise Tax to which it relates, and setting forth Employer's determination of the amount of gross income Employee is required to recognize as a result of such payments and Employee's liability for the Excise Tax. Employee shall cause his or her federal, state, and local income tax returns for the period in which Employee receive such Gross-Up Payment to be prepared and filed in accordance with such statement, and, upon such filing, Employee shall certify in writing to Employer that such returns have been so prepared and filed. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.3(a), Employer shall not be obligated to
 
indemnify Employee from and against any tax liability, cost or expense (including, without limitation, any liability for the Excise Tax or attorney's fees or costs) to the extent such tax liability, cost or expense is attributable to your failure to comply with the provisions of this Section 2.3(b).
(c) If any controversy arises between Employee and a Taxing Authority with respect to the treatment on any return of the Gross-Up Amount, or of any payment Employee receives from Employer as an Excess Parachute Payment, or with respect to any return which a Taxing Authority asserts should show an Excess Parachute Payment, including, without limitation, any audit, protest to an appeals authority of a Taxing Authority or litigation (a "Controversy"), Employer shall have the right to participate with Employee in the handling of such Controversy. Employer shall have the right, solely with respect to a Controversy, to direct Employee to protest or contest any proposed adjustment or deficiency, initiate an appeals procedure within any Taxing Authority, commence any judicial proceeding, make any settlement agreement, or file a claim for refund of tax, and Employee shall not take any of such steps without the prior written approval of Employer, which Employer shall not unreasonably withhold. If Employer so elects, Employee shall be represented in any Controversy by attorneys, accountants, and other advisors selected by Employer, and Employer shall pay the fees, costs and expenses of such attorneys, accountants, or advisors, and any tax liability Employee may incur as a result of such payment. Employee shall promptly notify Employer of any communication with a Taxing Authority, and Employee shall promptly furnish to Employer copies of any written correspondence, notices, or documents received from a Taxing Authority relating to a Controversy. Employee shall cooperate fully with Employer in the handling of any Controversy by furnishing Employer any information or documentation relating to or bearing upon the Controversy; , , that Employee shall not be obligated to furnish to Employer copies of any portion of his or her tax returns which do not bear upon, and are not affected by, the Controversy.
provided
however
(d) Employee shall pay over to Employer, within ten (10) days after receipt thereof, any refund Employee receive from any Taxing Authority of all or any portion of the Gross-Up Payment or the Excise Tax, together with any interest Employee receive from such Taxing Authority on such refund. For purposes of this Section 2.3(d), a reduction in Employee's tax liability attributable to the previous payment of the Gross-Up Amount or the Excise Tax shall be deemed to be a refund. If Employee would have received a refund of all or any portion of the Gross-Up Payment or the Excise Tax, except that a Taxing Authority offset the amount of such refund against other tax liabilities, interest, or penalties, Employee shall pay the amount of such offset over to Employer, together with the amount of interest Employee would have received from the Taxing Authority if such offset had been an actual refund, within ten (10) days after receipt of notice from the Taxing Authority of such offset.
