Item 1.01            Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
As disclosed in prior filings of Wynn Resorts, Limited ("WRL") and Wynn Las Vegas, LLC ("WLV") with the Securities and Exchange Commission, effective July 1, 2005, Stephen A. Wynn ("Mr. Wynn"), Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of WRL, and his wife, Elaine P. Wynn ("Mrs. Wynn"), who is also a director of WRL, lease from year to year a villa suite in the Wynn Las Vegas resort as their personal residence.  Rent is determined by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of WRL (the Audit Committee), and is based on the fair market value of the use of the suite accommodations.  As previously disclosed in the Forms 10-Q of WRL and WLV for the quarter ended March 31, 2008, based on a third-party appraisal and a reduction in certain services to be provided under the lease, for the two year period commencing July 1, 2008 and ending June 30, 2010, the Audit Committee determined the rent for each year will be $520,000.
On June 10, 2008, Mr. Wynn and WLV entered into a Second Amendment to Agreement of Lease (the "Second Amendment") memorializing the amount of rent for the two year period described above.  A copy of the Second Amendment is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
