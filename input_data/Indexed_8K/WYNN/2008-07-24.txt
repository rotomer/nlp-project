LAS VEGAS, July 24, 2008 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Wynn Resorts, Limited (Nasdaq: WYNN) today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2008.
 
Net revenues for the second quarter of 2008 were $825.2 million, compared to $687.5 million in the second quarter of 2007. The revenue increase was driven primarily by a 50.3% increase in revenues at Wynn Macau.

The following table games results are segregated into two distinct reporting categories, the VIP segment and the mass market segment.
 
Table games turnover in the VIP segment increased 74.9% to $16.3 billion for the period, compared to $9.3 billion for the second quarter of 2007. VIP table games win as a percentage of turnover (calculated before discounts and commissions) was 2.96%, at the top end of the expected range of 2.7% to 3.0% and lower than the 3.25% in the comparable period of 2007.

Slot machine win increased 89.6% compared to the second quarter of 2007. Win per unit per day was $359, a 31.1% decline from the second quarter of 2007 due to the increase in the average number of slot machines from 457 to 1,258 slots.

We commenced construction of Encore at Wynn Macau in 2007, and expect the property to open in the first half of 2010. As of June 30, 2008, we have incurred $114.1 million of an expected $700 million budget associated with the construction of Encore at Wynn Macau.
 
Other Factors Affecting Earnings
 
Interest expense, net of $20.5 million in capitalized interest, was $41.0 million for the second quarter of 2008. Depreciation and amortization expenses were $63.8 million and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas pre-opening expenses were $6.8 million during the quarter. Corporate expense and other was $16.6 million in the second quarter, including $5.1 million in stock based compensation. Property charges of $5.3 million are primarily related to the abandonment of certain existing floor space to begin construction of a new restaurant at Wynn Macau.
During the quarter, the Company completed a study of the taxes, levies and obligations assessed on its Macau operations under Macau law and its Macau Gaming Concession. As a result, the Company recorded a $140.7 million deferred tax  benefit (net of valuation allowance) for foreign tax credits applicable to the earnings of Wynn Macau which were included in the Companys US tax expense in prior years.
 
Balance Sheet and Capital Expenditures
 
Our total cash balances at the end of the quarter were $1.4 billion, including unrestricted cash balances of $1.3 billion and cash balances restricted for construction and development and stock repurchases of $75 million. Total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $3.9 billion, including approximately $2.3 billion of Wynn Las Vegas debt, $550 million of Wynn Macau related debt and $1.0 billion at Wynn Resorts, Limited. Capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2008, net of changes in construction payables and retention, totaled approximately $335 million, primarily attributable to Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.
 
On July 10, 2008, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an increase of up to $500 million to the Companys previously announced $1.2 billion equity repurchase program.

Forward-looking Statements
 
This release contains forward-looking statements regarding operating trends and future results of operations.  Such forward-looking information involves important risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect anticipated results in the future and, accordingly, such results may differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, competition in the casino/hotel and resorts industries, the Companys brief operating history, the Companys dependence on existing management, levels of travel, leisure and casino spending, general domestic or international economic conditions, and changes in gaming laws or regulations. Additional information concerning potential factors that could affect the Company's financial results is included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 and the Company's other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company is under no obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligation to) update its forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures
 
(1) Adjusted property EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening costs, property charges and other, corporate expenses, stock-based compensation, and other non-operating income and expenses.  Adjusted property EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses adjusted property EBITDA as a measure of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors.  The Company also presents adjusted property EBITDA because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a companys ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements.  Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDA as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including Wynn Resorts, Limited, have historically excluded from their EBITDA calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges and corporate expenses, that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties.  However, adjusted property EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Companys performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.  Unlike net income, adjusted property EBITDA does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital.  The Company compensates for these limitations by using adjusted property EBITDA as only one of several comparative tools, together with GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance.  Such GAAP measurements include operating income (loss), net income, cash flows from operations and cash flow data. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in adjusted property EBITDA.  Also, Wynn Resorts calculation of adjusted property EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
 
The Company has included schedules in the tables that accompany this release that reconcile (i) net income to adjusted net income, and (ii) operating income to adjusted property EBITDA and adjusted property EBITDA to net income.
 
(2) Adjusted net income is net income before pre-opening costs, property charges, one time tax adjustments and other, and other non-cash non-operating income and expenses.  Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share (EPS) are presented as supplemental disclosures because management believes that these financial measures are widely used to measure the performance, and as a principal basis for valuation, of gaming companies. These measures are used by management and/orevaluated by some investors, in addition to income and EPS computed in accordance with GAAP, as an additional basis for assessing period-to-period results of our business. Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
 
 
 
 
 
 
* Diluted earnings per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 include the assumption that the convertible subordinated debentures were converted into shares of common stock.  Accordingly, net income used in the computation of diluted earnings per share is increased by approximately $2.3 million and  $4.6 million, respectively, of net interest attributable to these debentures for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007.
