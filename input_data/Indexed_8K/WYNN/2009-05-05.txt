LAS VEGAS, May 5, 2009 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Wynn Resorts, Limited (Nasdaq: WYNN) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009.
 
Net revenues for the first quarter of 2009 were $740.0 million, compared to $778.7 million in the first quarter of 2008. The revenue decline was driven primarily by 8.7% lower revenues at Wynn Macau.
 
Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA (1) decreased 19.9% to $158.5 million for the first quarter of 2009, compared to $197.8 million in the first quarter of 2008.
 
On a US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) basis, net loss for the quarter was $33.8 million, or ($0.30) per diluted share, compared to net income of $46.7 million, or $0.41 per diluted share in 2008.  Adjusted net loss in the first quarter of 2009 was $30.1 million, or ($0.27) per diluted share (adjusted EPS)(2) compared to an adjusted net income of $78.2 million, or $0.69 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2008.
 
Las Vegas First Quarter Results
 
Our results of operations for the periods presented are not comparable as the three months ended March 31, 2009 includes Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, which opened on December 22, 2008. The prior year quarter includes only Wynn Las Vegas.
 
For the quarter ended March 31, 2009, our Las Vegas operations generated adjusted EBITDA of $43.9 million, compared to $68.4 million in the first quarter of 2008, with a 15.1% EBITDA margin on net revenue. The EBITDA decline was primarily driven by higher operating expenses associated with the opening of Encore.

Net casino revenues in the first quarter of 2009 were $117.5 million, compared to $125.1 million for the first quarter of 2008. Table games drop was $520.0 million, with win per table per day (before discounts) of $4,404, compared to drop of $533.3 million and win per table per day of $8,632 in the first quarter of 2008. Table games win percentage of 17.7% was below the propertys expected range of 21% to 24% and the 19.9% in the first quarter of 2008. Slot machine handle of $919.2 million was 2.5% above the comparable period of 2008 and win per unit per day was $179, compared to a win per unit per day of $227 in the first quarter of 2008. The reduction in win per table and win per unit is due primarily to the addition of 97 tables and 857 slot machines with the opening of Encore.
 
Gross non-casino revenues for the quarter were $228.4 million, a 13.3% increase from the first quarter of 2008, driven primarily by higher hotel and food and beverage revenues resulting from the opening of Encore. Hotel revenues were up 20.6% to $85.1 million during the quarter, versus $70.6 million in the first quarter of 2008 due to the addition of 2,034 suites at Encore. Our Las Vegas operations achieved an Average Daily Rate (ADR) of $222 for the quarter, compared to $298 in the first quarter of 2008. Our occupancy was 89.5%, compared to 95.8% during the prior year period, generating revenue per available room (REVPAR) of $199 in the 2009 period (30.3% below the first quarter of 2008 of $285).
 
Food and beverage revenues increased 25.6% to $96.9 million in the quarter as a result of the additional 12 food and beverage outlets located in the Encore expansion. Retail revenues were $19.6 million in the quarter, compared to $22.6 million, a 13.5% decline resulting primarily from reduced consumer spending in the first quarter of 2009. Entertainment revenues decreased $6.4 million (33.3%) from the first quarter of 2008 primarily due to the closure of the Spamalot production show in July 2008.
 
Macau First Quarter Results
 
In the first quarter of 2009, net revenues were $448.7 million compared $491.5 million in the first quarter of 2008. Wynn Macau generated adjusted property EBITDA of $114.6 million, compared to $129.4 million in the first quarter of 2008.
 
Table games turnover in the VIP segment was $10.7 billion for the period, compared to $14.8 billion for the first quarter of 2008. VIP table games win as a percentage of turnover (calculated before discounts and commissions) for the first quarter of 2009 was 3.6%, higher than the 3.0% experienced in the 2008 period and above the expected range of 2.7% to 3.0%.

Encore at Wynn Macau
 
Construction continues on a further expansion of Wynn Macau. Encore at Wynn Macau is expected to open in 2010, adding a fully-integrated resort hotel to Wynn Macau with approximately 400 luxury suites and four villas, along with restaurants, retail and gaming space. The current project budget is approximately $700 million.
 
As of March 31, 2009, we have incurred $254.6 million associated with the construction of Encore at Wynn Macau.
 
Other Factors Affecting Earnings
 
Interest expense, net of $2.4 million in capitalized interest, was $57.0 million for the first quarter of 2009. Depreciation and amortization expenses were $101.5 million and we had no pre-opening expenses. Corporate expense and other was $13.4 million in the first quarter, including $5.4 million in stock based compensation. Property charges of $16.5 million are primarily related to the write-off of aircraft purchase deposits.  Our first quarter 2009 tax expense of $15.9 million reflects additional reserves against deferred tax assets which are not directly related to our first quarter operating results.
 
Balance Sheet and Capital Expenditures
 
Our total cash balances on March 31, 2009 were $1.7 billion. Total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4.8 billion, including approximately $2.8 billion of Wynn Las Vegas debt, $1.6 billion of Wynn Macau debt and $375 million outstanding under the Wynn Resorts Term Loan Facility.
 
Capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2009 of approximately $185 million included the payment of certain construction payables and retention associated with Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and ongoing construction of Encore at Wynn Macau.

Non-GAAP financial measures
 
(1) Adjusted property EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening costs, property charges and other, corporate expenses, stock-based compensation, and other non-operating income and expenses.  Adjusted property EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses adjusted property EBITDA as a measure of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors.  The Company also presents adjusted property EBITDA because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a companys ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements.  Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDA as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including Wynn Resorts, Limited, have historically excluded from their EBITDA calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges and corporate expenses, that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties.  However, adjusted property EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Companys performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.  Unlike net income, adjusted property EBITDA does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital.  The Company compensates for these limitations by using adjusted property EBITDA as only one of several comparative tools, together with GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance.  Such GAAP measurements include operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operations and cash flow data. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in adjusted property EBITDA.  Also, Wynn Resorts calculation of adjusted property EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
 
The Company has included schedules in the tables that accompany this release that reconcile (i) net income (loss) to adjusted net income (loss), and (ii) operating income (loss) to adjusted property EBITDA and adjusted property EBITDA to net income (loss).
 
(2) Adjusted net income (loss) is net income (loss) before pre-opening costs, property charges and other non-cash non-operating income and expenses.  Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share (EPS) are presented as supplemental disclosures because management believes that these financial measures are widely used to measure the performance, and as a principal basis for valuation, of gaming companies. These measures are used by management and/orevaluated by some investors, in addition to income and EPS computed in accordance with GAAP, as an additional basis for assessing period-to-period results of our business. Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
