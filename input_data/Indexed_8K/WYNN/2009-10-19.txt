The Notes will mature on November 1, 2017 and bear interest at the rate of 7.875% per annum. The Issuers may redeem all or a portion of the Notes at any time on or after November 1, 2013 at a premium decreasing ratably to zero, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, prior to November 1, 2012 the Issuers may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net proceeds of one or more qualified equity contributions made to the Issuers by their parent, Wynn Resorts, Limited. If the Issuers undergo a change of control, they must offer to repurchase the Notes at 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. If the Issuers sell certain assets or suffer an event of loss, and the Issuers do not use the sale or insurance proceeds for specified purposes, they must offer to repurchase the Notes at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

The first priority lien securing the Notes may be released in whole, or in part, under certain circumstances without the consent of the holders of the Notes. Pursuant to an intercreditor agreement, as long as any indebtedness is outstanding under Wynn Las Vegas' credit facilities and as long as any of the Existing Notes remain outstanding, the holders of the Notes will not have any right to direct the collateral agent to enforce remedies against the collateral.

The guarantees of the Notes are secured on an equal and ratable basis by a first priority lien on substantially all of the Guarantors' assets, the same collateral that secures the guarantees under Wynn Las Vegas' credit facilities and the Existing Notes.
The Issuers intend to use the net proceeds from the offering of Notes to repay approximately $380.0 million in revolving credit borrowings and approximately $100.0 million in term loan borrowings under Wynn Las Vegas' credit facilities.
The Indenture contains covenants limiting the Issuers' and the Issuers' restricted subsidiaries' ability to: pay dividends or distributions or repurchase equity; incur additional debt; make investments; create liens on assets to secure debt; enter into transactions with affiliates; issue stock of, or member's interests in, subsidiaries; enter into sale-leaseback transactions;
engage in other businesses; merge or consolidate with another company; transfer and sell assets; issue disqualified stock; create dividend and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries; and designate restricted and unrestricted subsidiaries. These covenants are subject to a number of important and significant limitations, qualifications and exceptions.
Events of default under the Indenture include, among others, the following: default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on the Notes, default in payment when due of the principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes; failure to comply with certain covenants in the Indenture; and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. In the case of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuers, any significant restricted subsidiary or any group of restricted subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a significant restricted subsidiary, all Notes then outstanding will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice.

Holders of temporary Notes shall be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture.

These funds and securities shall be released to Wynn Las Vegas (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) to pay for or reimburse Wynn Las Vegas (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) for either (1) the actual cost of a permitted use of Net Loss Proceeds as provided in this Section 4.16, or (2) the Event of Loss Offer, pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Documents.

The Board of Directors of Wynn Capital may at any time redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas to be a Restricted Subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas; that such designation shall be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation shall only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under Section 4.09 hereof, calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the four-quarter reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.

Upon any such declaration, the Notes shall become due and payable immediately. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of all of the Holders rescind an acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default (except nonpayment of principal, interest or premium or Liquidated Damages, if any, that has become due solely because of the acceleration) have been cured or waived.
Section 6.03
Other Remedies.

The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder of a Note in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.
 
Section 6.04
Waiver of Past Defaults.
Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes, waive an existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences hereunder, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes (including in connection with an offer to purchase); ,, that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
provided

Section 6.05
Control by Majority.
Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it.

Section 6.07
Rights of Holders of Notes to Receive Payment.

(1) the principal of, premium and Liquidated Damages, if any, and interest on the Notes shall be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Issuers to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder shall be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and

Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and performance and not a guarantee of collection.
(b) The Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder are unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes, this Indenture or the Collateral Documents, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Issuers, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor. Each of the Guarantors hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of either Issuer, any right to require a proceeding first against the Issuers, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenant that this Note Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and this Indenture. Each Guarantor waives any right or claims of right to cause a marshalling of the Issuers' or any Guarantor's assets or to proceed against any Guarantor, any Issuer or any other guarantor of any Obligations that are Guaranteed in any particular order, including, but not limited to, any right arising out of Nevada Revised Statutes 40.430, to the fullest extent permitted by Nevada Revised Statutes 40.495(2).
(c) If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Issuers, the Guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either Issuer or any Guarantor, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Note Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect.
 
(d) Each of the Guarantors agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each of the Guarantors further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (1) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 hereof for the purposes of this Note Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (2) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 6 hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Note Guarantee. The Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor, as the case may be, so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Note Guarantee.
Section 11.02
Limitation on Guarantor Liability.
Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any Note Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of each such Guarantor shall be limited to the maximum amount that shall, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor, as the case may be, that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article 11, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Note Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
Section 11.03
Execution and Delivery of Note Guarantee.
To evidence its Note Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01, each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that a notation of such Note Guarantee substantially in the form attached as hereto shall be endorsed by an Officer of such Guarantor on each Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and that this Indenture shall be executed on behalf of such Guarantor by one of its Officers.
Exhibit E
Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that its Note Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Note a notation of such Note Guarantee.
If an Officer whose signature is on this Indenture or on the Note Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note on which a Note Guarantee is endorsed, the Note Guarantee shall be valid nevertheless.
 
The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the Note Guarantee set forth in this Indenture on behalf of the Guarantors.
In the event that the Issuers create or acquire any Subsidiary after the date of this Indenture, if required by Sections 4.22 and 4.26 hereof, the Issuers shall cause such Subsidiary to comply with the provisions of Sections 4.22 and 4.26 hereof and this Article 11, to the extent applicable.

Such successor Person thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Note Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the Notes issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Issuers and delivered to the Trustee. All the Note Guarantees so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Note Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Note Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.
(c) Except as set forth in Articles 4 and 5 hereof, nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the Notes shall prevent any consolidation or merger of a Guarantor with or into the Issuers or another Guarantor, or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of a Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Issuers or another Guarantor.

(b) Each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Issuers and the Guarantors, and their respective members, managers, directors and officers, and each person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Issuers, or the Guarantors to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Issuers and the Guarantors set forth in section (a) above, but only with reference to information included in the Registration Statement or any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information expressly furnished to the Issuers by or on behalf of such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement.

The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability that the each Holder may otherwise have to the Issuers and the Guarantors.
 
(c) In case any action shall be commenced involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b) (the ""), the indemnified party shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such action, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and the payment of all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, as incurred (except that in the case of any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to both Sections 8(a) and 8(b), a Holder shall not be required to assume the defense of such action pursuant to this Section 8(c), but may employ separate counsel and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel, except as provided below, shall be at the expense of the Holder). Any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such action or employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and the indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party).

Such firm shall be designated in writing by a majority of the Holders, in the case of the parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Issuers and the Guarantors, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b). The indemnifying party shall indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments by reason of any settlement of any action (i) effected with the indemnifying party's written consent or (ii) effected without the indemnifying party's written consent, if the settlement is entered into more than 30 business days after the indemnifying party shall have received a request from the indemnified party for reimbursement for the fees and expenses of counsel (in any case where such fees and expenses are at the expense of the indemnifying party) and, prior to the date of such settlement, the indemnifying party shall have failed to comply with such reimbursement request.

(d) To the extent that the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuers and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, from their sale of Transfer Restricted Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Issuers and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and of the Holder, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Issuers and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and of the Holder, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such Issuer or such Guarantor, on the one hand, or by the Holder, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(a), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
The Issuers, the Guarantors and each Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any matter, including any action that could have given rise to such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Holder, its directors, its officers or any Person, if any, who controls such Holder shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the total received by such Holder with respect to the sale of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds (i) the amount paid by such Holder for such Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(c) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities held by each Holder hereunder and not joint.
 
SECTION 9. RULE 144A AND RULE 144
