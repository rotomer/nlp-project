Las Vegas Third Quarter Results
 
Our results of operations for the periods presented are not comparable to prior periods as the three months ended September 30, 2009 includes Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, which opened on December 22, 2008. The prior year quarter includes only Wynn Las Vegas.
 
For the quarter ended September 30, 2009, our Las Vegas operations generated adjusted property EBITDA of $70.0 million (with a 21.6% EBITDA margin on net revenue), flat when compared to the $70.1 million generated in the third quarter of 2008. Revenues at Wynn Las Vegas were up 10.2% but EBITDA was flat due to the additional costs associated with the operation of Encore.
 
Net casino revenues in the third quarter of 2009 were $144.0 million, flat with the third quarter of 2008. Table games drop was $518.1 million, with win per table per day (before discounts) of $5,801, compared to drop of $531.0 million and win per table per day of $10,062 in the third quarter of 2008. Table games win percentage of 23.7% was within the propertys expected range of 21% to 24%. Slot machine handle of $850.3 million was in-line with the comparable period of 2008 and win per unit per day was $149, compared to a win per unit per day of $225 in the third quarter of 2008. The reduction in win per table and win per unit is due to the addition of 91 tables and 812 slot machines primarily at Encore.
 
Gross non-casino revenues for the quarter were $225.0 million, a 17.9% increase from the third quarter of 2008, driven primarily by higher hotel and food and beverage revenues resulting from Encore. Hotel revenues were up 17.7% to $76.9 million during the quarter, versus $65.3 million in the third quarter of 2008 due to the addition of 2,034 suites at Encore. Our Las Vegas operations achieved an Average Daily Rate (ADR) of $210 for the quarter, compared to $272 in the 2008 quarter. Our occupancy was 83.9%, compared to 96.1% during the prior year period, generating revenue per available room (REVPAR) of $176 in the 2009 period (32.6% below the third quarter of 2008 of $261).
 
Food and beverage revenues increased 29.8% to $96.8 million in the quarter as a result of the additional 12 food and beverage outlets located in Encore. Retail revenues were $21.0 million in the quarter, 8.6% below last years levels and entertainment revenues increased 3.9% to $16.6 million from the third quarter of 2008 primarily due to the contribution from headliner performances during the quarter.
 
Macau Third Quarter Results
 
In the third quarter of 2009, net revenues were $448.5 million compared to $474.8 million in the third quarter of 2008. Wynn Macau generated adjusted property EBITDA of $128.2 million, compared to $106.3 million in the third quarter of 2008.
 
Table games turnover in the VIP segment was $14.1 billion for the period, compared to $13.3 billion for the third quarter of 2008. VIP table games win as a percentage of turnover (calculated before discounts and commissions) for the third quarter of 2009 was 2.8%, within the expected range of 2.7% to 3.0% and below the 3.1% experienced in the 2008 quarter.

Slot machine win decreased 8.9% compared to the third quarter of 2008 and win per unit per day decreased 0.3% to $365 compared to $366 in the third quarter 2008 as we reconfigured the slot floor and removed approximately 100 machines.

Forward-looking Statements
 
This release contains forward-looking statements regarding operating trends and future results of operations.  Such forward-looking information involves important risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect anticipated results in the future and, accordingly, such results may differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, competition in the casino/hotel and resorts industries, the Companys dependence on existing management, levels of travel, leisure and casino spending, general economic conditions, and changes in gaming laws or regulations. Additional information concerning potential factors that could affect the Company's financial results is included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 and the Company's other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company is under no obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligation to) update its forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures
 
(1) Adjusted property EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening costs, property charges and other, corporate expenses, stock-based compensation, and other non-operating income and expenses, and includes equity in income (loss) from unconsolidated affiliates.  Adjusted property EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses adjusted property EBITDA as a measure of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors.  The Company also presents adjusted property EBITDA because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a companys ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements.  Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDA as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including Wynn Resorts, Limited, have historically excluded from their EBITDA calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges and corporate expenses, that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties.  However, adjusted property EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Companys performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.  Unlike net income, adjusted property EBITDA does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital.  The Company compensates for these limitations by using adjusted property EBITDA as only one of several comparative tools, together with GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance.  Such GAAP measurements include operating income (loss), net income, cash flows from operations and cash flow data. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in adjusted property EBITDA.  Also, Wynn Resorts calculation of adjusted property EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
 
The Company has included schedules in the tables that accompany this release that reconcile (i) net income to adjusted net income, and (ii) operating income (loss) to adjusted property EBITDA and adjusted property EBITDA to net income.
 
(2) Adjusted net income is net income before pre-opening costs, property charges and other non-cash non-operating income and expenses.  Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share (EPS) are presented as supplemental disclosures because management believes that these financial measures are widely used to measure the performance, and as a principal basis for valuation, of gaming companies. These measures are used by management and/orevaluated by some investors, in addition to income and EPS computed in accordance with GAAP, as an additional basis for assessing period-to-period results of our business. Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
