(i)         
General Provisions Relating to Transfers and Exchanges.
 
(1)           To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Issuers shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate Global Notes and Definitive Notes upon receipt of an Authentication Order in accordance with Section 2.02 or at the Registrars request.
 
(2)           No service charge shall be made to a Holder of a Global Note or to a Holder of a Definitive Note for any registration of transfer or exchange, but the Issuers may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than any such transfer taxes or similar governmental charge payable upon exchange or transfer pursuant to Sections 2.10, 3.06, 3.10, 4.10, 4.15, 4.16 and 9.05 hereof).
 
(3)           The Registrar shall not be required to register the transfer of or exchange any Note selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part.
 
(4)           All Global Notes and Definitive Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Global Notes or Definitive Notes shall be the valid obligations of the Issuers, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Global Notes or Definitive Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
 
(5)           Neither the Registrar nor the Issuers shall be required:
 
  (A)           to issue, to register the transfer of or to exchange any Notes during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of any selection of Notes for redemption under Section 3.02 hereof and ending at the close of business on the day of selection;
 
  (B)           to register the transfer of or to exchange any Note selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part; or
 
 
59
 
 
  (C)           to register the transfer of or to exchange a Note between a record date and the next succeeding interest payment date.
 
(6)           Prior to due presentment for the registration of a transfer of any Note, the Trustee, any Agent and the Issuers may deem and treat the Person in whose name any Note is registered as the absolute owner of such Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and interest on such Notes and for all other purposes, and none of the Trustee, any Agent or the Issuers shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
(7)           The Trustee shall authenticate Global Notes and Definitive Notes in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.02 hereof.
 
(8)           All certifications and certificates required to be submitted to the Registrar pursuant to this Section 2.06 to effect a registration of transfer or exchange may be submitted by facsimile.
 
 
If any mutilated Note is surrendered to the Trustee or the Issuers and the Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Note, the Issuers shall issue and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, shall authenticate a replacement Note if the Trustees requirements are met.  If required by the Trustee or the Issuers, an indemnity bond must be supplied by the Holder that is sufficient in the judgment of the Trustee and the Issuers to protect the Issuers, the Trustee, any Agent and any authenticating agent from any loss that any of them may suffer if a Note is replaced.  The Issuers may charge for their expenses in replacing a Note.
 
Every replacement Note is an additional obligation of the Issuers and shall be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with all other Notes duly issued hereunder.
 
 
The Notes outstanding at any time are all the Notes authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation, those reductions in the interest in a Global Note effected by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions hereof, and those described in this Section 2.08 as not outstanding.  Except as set forth in Section 2.09 hereof, a Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Issuers or an Affiliate of either Issuer holds the Note.
 
If a Note is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Note is held by a protected purchaser.
 
If the principal amount of any Note is considered paid under Section 4.01 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding and interest on it ceases to accrue.
 
 
60
 
 
If the Paying Agent (other than an Issuer, a Subsidiary of an Issuer or an Affiliate of any thereof) holds, on a redemption date or maturity date, money sufficient to pay Notes payable on that date, then on and after that date such Notes shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding and shall cease to accrue interest.
 
 
In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Issuers, or any of their Affiliates, shall be considered as though not outstanding, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes that the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.
 
 
Until certificates representing Notes are ready for delivery, the Issuers may prepare and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, shall authenticate temporary Notes.  Temporary Notes shall be substantially in the form of certificated Notes but may have variations that the Issuers consider appropriate for temporary Notes and as may be reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.  Without unreasonable delay, the Issuers shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate Definitive Notes in exchange for temporary Notes.
 
Holders of temporary Notes shall be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture.
 
 
The Issuers at any time may deliver Notes to the Trustee for cancellation.  The Registrar and Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Notes surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment.  The Trustee and no one else shall cancel all Notes surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation and shall destroy canceled Notes in its customary manner (subject to the record retention requirement of the Exchange Act).  Certification of the destruction of all canceled Notes shall be delivered to the Issuers.  The Issuers may not issue new Notes to replace Notes that they have paid or that have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
 
 
If the Issuers default in a payment of interest on the Notes, they shall pay the defaulted interest in any lawful manner plus, to the extent lawful, interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the Persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date, in each case, at the rate provided in the Notes and in Section 4.01 hereof.  The Issuers shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of defaulted interest proposed to be paid on each Note and the date of the proposed payment.  The Issuers shall fix or cause to be fixed each such special record date and payment date, provided that no such special record date may be less than 10 days prior to the related payment date for such defaulted interest.  At least 15 days before the special record date, the Issuers (or, upon the written request of the Issuers, the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Issuers) shall mail or cause to be mailed to Holders a notice that states the special record date, the related payment date and the amount of such interest to be paid.
 
 
61
 
 
 
The Issuers will be entitled, upon delivery of an Officers Certificate, Opinion of Counsel and Authentication Order, subject to compliance with Sections 2.02, 4.09 and 4.12 hereof, to issue Additional Notes under this Indenture, which shall have identical terms as the Initial Notes issued on the date of this Indenture, other than with respect to the date of issuance, the initial date from which interest shall accrue on such Additional Notes and issue price.  Subject to Sections 4.09 and 4.12 hereof, without the consent of any Holder of Notes, the Issuers will be entitled to make any amendments to this Indenture, the Note Guarantees or any of the Collateral Documents as they reasonably determine appropriate in good faith to facilitate the issuance of such Additional Notes.

(a)        the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes to be authenticated and delivered pursuant to this Indenture; and
 
(b)        which such Additional Notes shall be Notes issued in the form of Restricted Global Notes or Restricted Definitive Notes, as the case may be, or shall be Notes issued in the form of Unrestricted Global Notes or Unrestricted Definitive Notes, as the case may be.

(b)        the redemption date;
 
(c)        the principal amount of Notes to be redeemed; and

(a)        if the Notes are listed on any national securities exchange, in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange on which the Notes are listed; or
 
 
62
 
 
(b)        if the Notes are not listed on any national securities exchange, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.
 
In the event of partial redemption or purchase by lot, the particular Notes to be redeemed or purchased shall be selected, unless otherwise provided herein, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption or purchase date by the Trustee from the outstanding Notes not previously called for redemption or purchase.
 
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuers in writing of the Notes selected for redemption or purchase and, in the case of any Note selected for partial redemption or purchase, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed or purchased.  Notes and portions of Notes selected shall be in amounts of $2,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000; provided, however, that if all of the Notes of a Holder are to be redeemed or purchased, the entire outstanding amount of Notes held by such Holder, even if not a multiple of $1,000, shall be redeemed or purchased.  Except as provided in the preceding sentence, provisions of this Indenture that apply to Notes called for redemption or purchase also apply to portions of Notes called for redemption or purchase.
 
 
Subject to the provisions of Section 3.10 hereof, at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before a redemption date, the Issuers shall mail or cause to be mailed, by first class mail, a notice of redemption to each Holder whose Notes are to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture pursuant to Articles 8 or 12 of this Indenture.
 
The notice shall identify the Notes to be redeemed and shall state:
 
(a)        the redemption date;
 
(b)        the redemption price;
 
(c)        if any Note is being redeemed in part, the portion of the principal amount of such Note to be redeemed and that, after the redemption date upon surrender of such Note, a new Note or Notes in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion shall be issued upon cancellation of the original Note;
 
(d)        the name and address of the Paying Agent;
 
(e)        that Notes called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price;
 
(f)         that, unless the Issuers default in making such redemption payment, interest on Notes called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the redemption date;
 
(g)        the paragraph of the Notes and/or Section of this Indenture pursuant to which the Notes called for redemption are being redeemed; and

Once notice of redemption is mailed in accordance with Section 3.03 hereof, Notes called for redemption become irrevocably due and payable on the redemption date at the redemption price.  A notice of redemption may not be conditional.  If mailed in the manner provided in Section 3.03 hereof, the notice of redemption shall be conclusively presumed to have been given whether or not the Holder receives such notice.

If the Issuers comply with the provisions of the preceding paragraph, on and after the redemption or purchase date, interest shall cease to accrue on the Notes or the portions of Notes called for redemption or purchase.  If a Note is redeemed or purchased on or after an interest record date but on or prior to the related interest payment date, then any accrued and unpaid interest shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Note was registered at the close of business on such record date.  If any Note called for redemption or purchase is not so paid upon surrender for redemption or purchase because of the failure of the Issuers to comply with the preceding paragraph, interest shall be paid on the unpaid principal, from the redemption or purchase date until such principal is paid, and to the extent lawful o n any interest not paid on such unpaid principal, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes and in Section 4.01 hereof.
 
 
Upon surrender of a Note that is redeemed or purchased in part, the Issuers shall issue and, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, the Trustee shall authenticate for the Holder at the expense of the Issuers a new Note equal in principal amount to the unredeemed or unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered.

(c)        For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 4.09, in the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in (1) through (16) of Section 4.09(b) hereof, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to Section 4.09(a), the Issuers shall be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this Section 4.09 as of the date of such classification or reclassification.  Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement outstanding on the date on which the Notes are first issued and authenticated under this Indenture shall initially be deemed to have been incurred on such dat e in reliance on the exception provided by clause (1) of Section 4.09(b) hereof.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that Wynn Las Vegas or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur pursuant to this Section 4.09 shall not be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.  In addition, any Indebtedness which is permitted to be incurred by Wynn Las Vegas or any of it s

Restricted Subsidiaries under clause (7) set forth above may be incurred under the Credit Agreement or through the issuance of Additional Notes under this Indenture.
 
The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be:
 
(1)           the accreted value of the Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount;
 
(2)           the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and
 
(3)           in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person, the lesser of:
 
  (A)           the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and
 
  (B)           the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person.
 
 
Wynn Las Vegas shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless:
 
(a)        Wynn Las Vegas (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of (it being understood that a percentage of the purchase price may be subject to escrow arrangements customary for asset sales);
 
(b)        if the aggregate consideration to be received by Wynn Las Vegas or such Restricted Subsidiary is in excess of $10.0 million, the Fair Market Value is evidenced by a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of Wynn Las Vegas delivered to the Trustee; and

(2)           any securities, notes or other obligations received by Wynn Las Vegas or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted within 30

Business Days by Wynn Las Vegas or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash, to the extent of the cash received in that conversion.
 
Within 360 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, Wynn Las Vegas (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary as the case may be) may apply such Net Proceeds to make a capital expenditure, improve real property or acquire long-term assets that are used or useful in a line of business permitted by Section 4.13 hereof.  In any such case, Wynn Las Vegas (or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) shall take all necessary action to ensure that the security interest of the Trustee, on behalf of the Holders, continues as a perfected first priority security interest (equal and ratable with the security interest securing the Credit Agreement, the 2014 Notes and the 2017 Notes, and subject to other Permitted Liens and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) on any property or assets acquired or co nstructed with the Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale on the terms set forth in this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Collateral Documents.  Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, Wynn Las Vegas (or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may (1) apply the Net Proceeds to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under any pari passu secured revolving credit Indebtedness of Wynn Las Vegas or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, or (2) invest the Net Proceeds in Cash Equivalents which, at any time other than during a Collateral Release Period, shall be subject to a perfected first priority security interest (equal and ratable with the security interest securing the Credit Agreement, the 2014 Notes and the 2017 Notes, and subject to other Permitted Liens and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) in favor of the Trustee, on behalf of the Holders, as security for the Notes.

The amount of any such Excess Proceeds less the Asset Sale Offer Amount (the ) shall concurrently be applied to repay any term Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement in accordance with the requirements of the Credit Agreement; provided, however, that to the extent that the Asset Sale Repayment Amount exceeds the amount of term Indebtedness then outstanding under the Credit Agreement at the time of repayment, such excess amount (after repayment in full of the term Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement) shall be added to the Asset Sale Offer Amount and offered to the holders of Notes and, to the extent required, the

If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer and repayment of any term Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement, Wynn Las Vegas (or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may use those Excess Proceeds for any general corporate purpose not prohibited by this Indenture, the Credit Agreement, the 2014 Notes, the 2017 Notes and the Collateral Documents, including, without limitation, to reduce revolving credit Indebtedness (and, if required, commitments) under the Credit Agreement.  If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and such other Pari Passu Debt tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the Asset Sale Offer Amount that may be applied to the Asset Sale Offer, the Trustee shall select the Notes and such other Pari Passu Debt to be purchased as described in Sections 3.02 and 3.10 hereof.  Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.
 
The Issuers shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer.  To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of Section 3.10 or this Section 4.10, the Issuers shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations under those provisions of this Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

Any Net Loss Proceeds that are (1) not reinvested as provided in the first sentence of this Section 4.16 or (2) otherwise required, pursuant to the Credit Agreement, to be applied to reduce Indebtedness of Wynn Las Vegas, in each case, shall be deemed . Within 10 days following the earlier of (i) the date on which the aggregate amount of Excess Loss Proceeds exceeds $500.0 million or (ii) the date when, pursuant to the Credit Agreement, Excess Loss Proceeds are required to be applied to reduce Indebtedness of Wynn Las Vegas, Wynn Las Vegas shall allocate a portion of such Excess Loss Proceeds determined by multiplying the amount of such Excess Loss Proceeds by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total agg regate principal amount of Notes then outstanding and all Pari Passu Debt then outstanding, and the denominator of which is the total aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, all Pari Passu Debt then outstanding and all Indebtedness then outstanding under the Credit Agreement (such amount being the ), to make an offer (an ) to all Holders of Notes and, to the extent required, the holders of such Pari Passu Debt to repurchase such Notes and such Pari Passu Debt at an offer price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and such Pari Passu Debt to be purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, on the Notes and such other Pari Passu Debt to the date of repurchase, which offer price shall be payable in cash.

Upon completion of each Event of Loss Offer, the amount of Excess Loss Proceeds shall be reset at zero.  Any Event of Loss Offer made pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the 2014 Notes or the 2017 Notes shall be required to be made to the Holders, as holders of Pari Passu Debt (as defined in those indentures).

These funds and securities shall be released to Wynn Las Vegas (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) to pay for or reimburse Wynn Las Vegas (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) for either (1) the actual cost of a permitted use of Net Loss Proceeds as provided in this Section 4.16, or (2) the Event of Loss Offer, pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Documents.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of all of th e Holders rescind an acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default (except nonpayment of principal, interest or premium or Liquidated Damages, if any, that has become due solely because of the acceleration) have been cured or waived.
 
 
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal, premium and Liquidated Damages, if any, and interest on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Notes or this Indenture.
 
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding.  A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder of a Note in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default.  All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.
 
 
Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes, waive an existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences hereunder, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes (including in connection with an offer to purchase); provided, however, that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration.  Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this I ndenture; but no
 
 
100
 
such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
 
Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it.  However, as long as any Indebtedness is outstanding under the Credit Agreement or any of the 2014 Notes remain outstanding, the Holders will not have any right to direct the Collateral Agent to enforce remedies against the Collateral.  In addition, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture that the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders of Notes or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability.
 
 
Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, interest, or premium, if any, or Liquidated Damages, if any, when due, a Holder of a Note may pursue a remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Notes only if:
 
(a)        such Holder of a Note gives to the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;
 
(b)        the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
 
(c)        such Holder or Holders offer and, if requested, provide to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;
 
(d)        the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and
 
(e)        during such 60-day period, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.
 
A Holder of a Note may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder of a Note or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder of a Note.
 
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder of a Note to receive payment of principal, premium and Liquidated Damages, if any, and interest on the Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Note (including in connection with an offer to purchase), or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder; provided that a Holder shall not have the right to institute any such suit for the enforcement of payment if
 
 
101
 
 
and to the extent that the institution or prosecution thereof or the entry of judgment therein would, under applicable law, result in the surrender, impairment, waiver or loss of the Lien of this Indenture upon any property subject to such Lien.
 
 
If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(a) or (b) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Issuers for the whole amount of principal of, premium and Liquidated Damages, if any, and interest remaining unpaid on, the Notes and interest on overdue principal and, to the extent lawful, interest and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
 
 
The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders of the Notes allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Issuers (or any other obligor upon the Notes), its creditors or its property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and any custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Truste e any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof.  To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties that the Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise.  Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
 
 
If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article 6, it shall pay out the money in the following order:
 
:      to the Trustee, its agents and attorneys for amounts due under Section 7.07 hereof, including payment of all compensation, expense and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and the costs and expenses of collection;
First
 
 
102
 
 
  to Holders of Notes for amounts due and unpaid on the Notes for principal, premium and Liquidated Damages, if any, and interest, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Notes for principal, premium and Liquidated Damages, if any and interest, respectively; and
Second:
 
     to the Issuers or to such party as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct.
Third:
 
The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders of Notes pursuant to this Section 6.10.
 
 
In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as a Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys fees, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant.  This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder of a Note pursuant to Section 6.07 hereof, or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes.
 
 
 
(a)        If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such persons own affairs.
 
(b)        Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:
 
(1)          the duties of the Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Indenture and the Collateral Documents, and the Trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in this Indenture and the Collateral Documents, and no others, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture and the Collateral Documents against the Trustee; and
 
(2)          in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture and the Collateral Documents.  However, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture and the Collateral Documents.
 
 
103
 
 
(c)        The Trustee may not be relieved from liabilities for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
 
(1)          this Section 7.01(c) does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of this Section 7.01;
 
(2)          the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and
 
(3)          the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it pursuant to Section 6.05 hereof.
 
(d)        Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this Section 7.01.
 
(e)        No provision of this Indenture or the Collateral Documents shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or incur any liability.  The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights and powers under this Indenture and the Collateral Documents at the request of any Holders, unless such Holder shall have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.
 
(f)         The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Issuers.  Money held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
 
 
(a)        The Trustee may conclusively rely upon any document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper Person.  The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document.
 
(b)        Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officers Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel or both.  The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on such Officers Certificate or Opinion of Counsel.  The Trustee may consult with counsel and the written advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection from liability in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon.
 
(c)        The Trustee may act through its attorneys and agents and shall not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent appointed with due care.
 
(d)        The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith that it believes to be authorized or within the rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture.
 
 
104
 
 
(e)        Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Indenture or the Collateral Documents, any demand, request, direction or notice from the Issuers shall be sufficient if signed by an Officer of either Issuer.
 
(f)         The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture or the Collateral Documents at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities that might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction.  Nor shall the Trustee be bound to investigate (i) the performance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or in any Security Agreement, (ii) the occurrence of any default, or the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Security Agreement or other agreement, instrument or document, (iii) t he creation, perfection or priority of any lien, (iv) the value or sufficiency of any Collateral or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in any Security Agreement.
 
(g)        Except as expressly provided herein, the Trustee shall have no duty to inquire as to the performance of the Issuers with respect to the covenants contained in Articles 4 and 5 hereof.
 
(h)        The Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of an Event of Default except (i) any Default or Event of Default occurring pursuant to Sections 6.01(a) and (b) hereof or (ii) any Default or Event of Default of which the Trustee shall have received written notification or obtained actual knowledge thereof.
 
(i)         The Trustee may request that the Issuers deliver Officers Certificates setting forth the names of individuals and their titles and specimen signatures of officers authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture, which Officers Certificates may be signed by any person authorized to sign an Officers Certificate, as the case may be, including any person specified as so authorized in any such certificate previously delivered and not superseded.
 
(j)         Any permissive right granted to the Trustee shall not be construed as a mandatory duty.
 
(k)        The Trustee shall not be required to give any bond or surety in respect of the performance of its powers and duties hereunder.
 
(l)         In no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder arising out of or caused by, directly or indirectly, forces beyond its control, including, without limitation, strikes, work stoppages, accidents, acts of war or terrorism, civil or military disturbances, nuclear or natural catastrophes or acts of God, and interruptions, loss or malfunctions or utilities, communications or computer (software and hardware) services; it being understood that the Trustee shall use reasonable efforts which are consistent with accepted practices in the banking industry to resume performance as soon as practicable under the circumstances.
 
 
105
 
 
 
The Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Issuers or any Affiliate of the Issuers with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.  However, in the event that the Trustee acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to continue as trustee (if this Indenture has been qualified under the TIA) or resign.  Any Agent may do the same with like rights and duties.  The Trustee is also subject to Sections 7.10 and 7.11 hereof.
 
 
The Trustee shall not be responsible for and makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Notes, it shall not be accountable for the Issuers use of the proceeds from the Notes or any money paid to the Issuers or upon the Issuers direction under any provision of this Indenture, it shall not be responsible for the use or application of any money received by any Paying Agent other than the Trustee, and it shall not be responsible for any statement or recital herein or any statement in the Notes or any other document in connection with the sale of the Notes or pursuant to this Indenture other than its certificate of authentication.
 
 
If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing and if it is known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail a notice of the Default or Event of Default to Holders within 90 days after it occurs.  Except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal of, premium or Liquidated Damages, if any, or interest on, any Note, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of the Holders of the Notes.
 
 
(a)        Within 60 days after each April 15 beginning with the April 15 following the date of this Indenture, and for so long as Notes remain outstanding, the Trustee shall mail to the Holders of the Notes a brief report dated as of such reporting date that complies with TIA  313(a) (but if no event described in TIA  313(a) has occurred within the twelve months preceding the reporting date, no report need be transmitted).  The Trustee also shall comply with TIA  313(b)(2).  The Trustee shall also transmit by mail all reports as required by TIA  313(c).
 
(b)        A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to the Holders of Notes shall be mailed by the Trustee to the Issuers and filed by the Trustee with the SEC and each stock exchange on which the Notes are listed in accordance with TIA  313(d).  The Issuers shall promptly notify the Trustee when the Notes are listed on any stock exchange.
 
 
(a)        The Issuers shall pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for its acceptance of this Indenture and services hereunder.  The Trustees compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust.  The Issuers shall
 
 
106
 
 
reimburse the Trustee promptly upon request for all reasonable disbursements, advances and expenses incurred or made by it in addition to the compensation for its services.  Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation, disbursements and expenses of the Trustees agents and counsel.
 
(b)        The Issuers and the Guarantors shall indemnify the Trustee against any and all losses, liabilities or expenses incurred by it arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under this Indenture and the Collateral Documents, including the costs and expenses of enforcing this Indenture against the Issuers and the Guarantors (including this Section 7.07) and defending itself against any claim (whether asserted by the Issuers, the Guarantors or any Holder or any other Person) or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder or thereunder, respectively, except to the extent any such loss, liability or expense may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith.  The Trustee shall notify the Issuers promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity.  Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Issuers shall not relieve the Issuers or any of the Guarantors of their obligations hereunder.  The Issuers or such Guarantor shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense.  The Trustee may have separate counsel and the Issuers shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel.  Neither the Issuers nor any Guarantor need pay for any settlement made without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
 
(c)        The obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors under this Section 7.07 shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.
 
(d)        To secure the Issuers and the Guarantors payment obligations in this Section 7.07, the Trustee shall have a Lien prior to the Notes on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal and interest on particular Notes.  Such Lien shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.
 
(e)        When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(k) or (l) hereof occurs, the expenses and the compensation for the services (including the fees and expenses of its agents and counsel) are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
 
(f)         The Trustee shall comply with the provisions of TIA  313(b)(2) to the extent applicable.
 
 
(a)        A resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee shall become effective only upon the successor Trustees acceptance of appointment as provided in this Section 7.08.
 
(b)        The Trustee may resign in writing at any time and be discharged from the trust hereby created by so notifying the Issuers in writing.  The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and the Issuers in writing.  The Issuers may remove the Trustee if:
 
 
107
 
 
(1)          the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10 hereof;
 
(2)          the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an order for relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under any Bankruptcy Law;
 
(3)          a custodian or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
 
(4)          the Trustee becomes incapable of acting.
 
(c)        If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason, the Issuers shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee.

(e)        If the Trustee, after written request by any Holder who has been a Holder for at least six months, fails to comply with Section 7.10, such Holder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
 
(f)         A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Issuers.  Thereupon, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture.  The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders.  The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, provided all sums owing to the Trustee hereunder have been paid and subject to the Lien for in Section 7.07 hereof.  Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Sectio n 7.08, the Issuers obligations under Section 7.07 hereof shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.
provided
 
 
If the Trustee consolidates, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another corporation, the successor corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee.

The Trustee is subject to TIA  311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA  311(b).  A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA  311(a) to the extent indicated therein.
 
 
 
The Issuers may, at the option of their respective Boards of Directors evidenced by a resolution set forth in an Officers Certificate of each Issuer, at any time, elect to have either Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof be applied to all outstanding Notes upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article 8.
 
 
Upon the Issuers exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.02, the Issuers shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, be deemed to have been discharged from their obligations with respect to all outstanding Notes, each of the Guarantors shall be deemed to be discharged from their obligations with respect to their Note Guarantees and the Issuers and each of the Guarantors shall be deemed to be discharged from their obligations with respect to the Collateral Documents on the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, ).  For this purpose, Legal Defeasance means that the Issuers and each of the Guarant ors shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by the outstanding Notes (including the Note Guarantees), which shall thereafter be deemed to be outstanding only for the purposes of Section 8.05 hereof and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in Sections 8.02(a) and (b) below, and to have satisfied all their other obligations under such Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Collateral Documents, and this Indenture (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Issuers, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following provisions which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder:
Legal Defeasance
 
(a)        the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or interest or premium and Liquidated Damages, if any, on such Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to in Section 8.04 hereof;
 
(b)        the Issuers obligations with respect to such Notes under Article 2 and Section 4.02 hereof;

Subject to compliance with this Article 8, the Issuers may exercise their option under this Section 8.02 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 8.03 hereof.
 
 
Upon the Issuers exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.03, the Issuers, the Restricted Subsidiaries of Wynn Las Vegas and any Guarantors shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, be released from each of their obligations under the covenants contained in Sections 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13 and 4.15 through 4.29 inclusive hereof and clause (5) of Section 5.01(a) hereof with respect to the outstanding Notes on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof are satisfied (hereinafter, ), and the Notes shall thereafter be deemed not outstanding for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed outstanding for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Notes shall not be deemed outstanding for accounting purposes).  For this purpose, Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Notes and Note Guarantees, the Issuers and each of the Guarantors released may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 6.01 hereof, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Notes and Note Guarantees sha ll be unaffected thereby.  In addition, upon the Issuers exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.03 hereof, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, Sections 6.01(c) through 6.01(h), Section 6.01(j) and Sections 6.01(n) through 6.01(p) hereof shall not constitute Events of Default.

(c)        in the case of an election under Section 8.03 hereof, the Issuers have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the Holders of the outstanding Notes shall not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and shall be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(e)        such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under any material agreement or instrument (other than this Indenture) to which either Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Guarantor is a party or by which any such Person is bound;
 
(f)         in the case of an election under Section 8.02 hereof, the Issuers must deliver to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that, assuming no intervening bankruptcy of the Issuers or any Guarantor between the date of deposit and the 91st day following the deposit and assuming that no Holder of Notes is an insider of either Issuer under applicable bankruptcy law, after the 91st day following the deposit, the trust funds shall not be subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors rights generally;

111
 
 
purposes of this Section 8.05, the Trustee) pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof in respect of the outstanding Notes shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Notes and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Issuers acting as Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Notes of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal, premium and Liquidated Damages, if any, and interest, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
 
The Issuers shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the cash or non-callable Government Securities deposited pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the outstanding Notes.

Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Issuers, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium or Liquidated Damages, if any, or interest on any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium or Liquidated Damages, if any, or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Issuers on its request or (if then held by the Issuers) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Note shall thereafter be permitted to look only to the Issuers for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Issuers as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the e xpense of the Issuers cause to be published once, in the New York Times (national edition) and The Wall Street Journal (national edition), notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such notification or publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining shall be repaid to the Issuers.
 
 
If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any United States dollars or non-callable Government Securities in accordance with Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof, as the case may be, by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Issuers or the Guarantors obligations under this Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral Documents shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money
 
 
112
 
 
in accordance with Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if the Issuers make any payment of principal of, premium or Liquidated Damages, if any, or interest on any Note following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Issuers shall subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.
 
 
 
Notwithstanding Section 9.02 of this Indenture, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuers, the Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the Collateral Documents to:
 
(a)        cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;
 
(b)        provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;
 
(c)        provide for the assumption of the Issuers or any Guarantors obligations to the Holders of the Notes and Note Guarantees by a successor to the Issuers or such Guarantor, as the case may be, in the case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Issuers or such Guarantors assets pursuant to Article 5 hereof;
 
(d)        make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders of the Notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights hereunder of any such Holder, including any amendment or modification to the Intercreditor Agreement that gives or provides for any additional rights to the Holders to direct the Collateral Agent to enforce remedies against the Collateral and/or participate in other decisions regarding collateral and/or the enforcement of security documents;
 
(e)        comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of this Indenture under the TIA;
 
(f)         provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in this Indenture as of the date of this Indenture;
 
(g)        allow any Guarantor to execute a supplemental indenture and/or a Note Guarantee with respect to the Notes; or
 
(h)        enter into additional or supplemental Collateral Documents or Guarantees or an intercreditor agreement with respect thereto.
 
Upon request of the Issuers, the Trustee will enter into amendments, restatements and modifications of the Collateral Documents from time to time in connection with the grant of any Permitted Liens; provided, however, that any such amended, restated or modified Collateral Documents shall contain terms no less favorable to the Trustee or the Holders of the Notes than the terms contained in the Collateral Documents being amended, restated or modified (except as
 
 
113
 
 
expressly provided for in this Indenture); provided, further, that any such amendment, restatement or modification does not otherwise adversely affect the rights or remedies of the Trustee or the Holders of the Notes in any material respect (except as expressly provided for in this Indenture).
 
Upon the request of the Issuers accompanied by a resolution of their respective Boards of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental indenture, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.02 hereof, the Trustee shall join with the Issuers and the Guarantors in the execution of any amended or supplemental indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into such amended or supplemental indenture that affects its own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
 
 
Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, the Issuers, the Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture (including, without limitation, Section 3.10, 4.10, 4.15 and 4.16 hereof), the Notes, the Note Guarantees and, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and this Indenture, the Collateral Documents, with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, Additional Notes, if any) voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and, subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, any existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium or Liqu idated Damages, if any, or interest on the Notes, except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of this Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees or, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and this Indenture, the Collateral Documents, may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, Additional Notes, if any) voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with purchase of, or a tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes).
 
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the Collateral Documents, any amendment or modification to the definition of Excluded Assets in the Pledge and Security Agreement or the definition of Excluded Property in the Deeds of Trust shall require, in addition to the other consents required pursuant to Section 10.01(b) hereof and the Intercreditor Agreement, the consent of at least a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, Additional Notes, if any) voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consent obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), if as a result of such amendment or modification, the Notes will not be secured by substantially all of th e assets of the Issuers and the Guarantors.
 
Upon the request of the Issuers accompanied by a resolution of their respective Boards of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental Indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders of
 
 
114
 
 
Notes as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.02 hereof, the Trustee shall join with the Issuers and the Guarantors in the execution of such amended or supplemental Indenture unless such amended or supplemental Indenture directly affects the Trustees own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture.
 
It is not necessary for the consent of the Holders of Notes under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it is sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
 
After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 becomes effective, the Issuers shall mail to the Holders of Notes affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver.  Any failure of the Issuers to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental indenture or waiver.  Subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding voting as a single class may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Issuers with any provision of this Indenture or the Notes or by the Guarantors with any provision of the Note Guarantees.  However, without the consent of each Holder affected or, in the case of clau ses (h), (i) and (j) below only, without the consent of the Holders of at least 95% in the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):
 
(a)        reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
 
(b)        reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter or waive any of the provisions with respect to the redemption of the Notes, except as provided above with respect to Sections 3.10, 4.10, 4.15 and 4.16 hereof;
 
(c)        reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on any Note;
 
(d)        waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest or premium or Liquidated Damages, if any, on the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);
 
(e)        make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes;
 
(f)         make any change in the provisions of this Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of, or interest or premium or Liquidated Damages, if any, on the Notes;
 
(g)        waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by Sections 3.10, 4.10, 4.15 and 4.16 hereof);
 
 
115
 
 
(h)        release all or substantially all of the Collateral, in each case, except in accordance with the provisions of the Collateral Documents;
 
(i)         release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Note Guarantee or this Indenture if the assets or properties of that Guarantor constitute all or substantially all of the Collateral, except in accordance with the terms of this Indenture;
 
(j)         amend the provisions of Section 10.03 hereof; or
 
(k)        make any change in the foregoing amendment and waiver provisions.
 
 
Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Notes shall be set forth in a amended or supplemental Indenture that complies with the TIA as then in effect.
 
 
Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Note and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holders Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note.  However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a Note may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the waiver, supplement or amendment becomes effective.  An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.
 
 
The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment, supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter authenticated.  The Issuers in exchange for all Notes may issue and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, authenticate new Notes that reflect the amendment, supplement or waiver.
 
Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.
 
 
The Trustee shall sign any amended or supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee.  The Issuers and the Guarantors may not sign an amendment or supplemental indenture until their respective Boards of Directors approve it.  In executing any amended or supplemental indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and (subject to Section 7.01 hereof) shall be fully protected in relying upon, in addition to the documents required by Section 14.04 hereof, an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture.

Each Holder of Notes, by its acceptance thereof, consents and agrees to the terms of the Collateral Documents (including, without limitation, the provisions providing for foreclosure and release of Collateral and limitations on exercise of rights and remedies) as the same may be in effect or may be amended from time to time in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and the Collateral Documents and authorizes and directs the Trustee to enter into the Collateral Documents and to perform its obligations and exercise its rights thereunder in accordance therewith.  The Issuers and Guarantors shall deliver to the Trustee copies of all documents delivered to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Collateral Documents and the Issuers shall do or cause to be done all such acts and things as may be necessary or proper, or as may be required by the pro visions of the Collateral Documents, to assure and confirm to the Trustee the security interests in the Collateral contemplated hereby, by the Collateral Documents or any part thereof, as from time to time constituted, so as to render the same available (subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) for the security and benefit of this Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees secured by the Collateral Documents, according to the intent and purposes therein expressed.  Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuers shall take, and shall cause the Restricted Subsidiaries that are party to one or more Collateral Documents to take, upon request of the Trustee, any and all actions reasonably required to cause the Collateral Documents to create and maintain, as security for the Obligations of the Issuers hereunder and of the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees, a valid and enforceable perfected Lien of the priority required by the Collateral Documents in and on all the Colla teral, in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of Notes, superior to and prior to the rights of all third Persons, in each case, equal and ratable with the Liens securing the obligations under the Credit Agreement and subject to Permitted Liens and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.
Exhibit G
 
(b)           Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Holder by accepting a Note agrees that, as described in the Deeds of Trust and the Pledge and Security Agreement, each of the Deeds of Trust and Pledge and Security Agreement and any other document or instrument pursuant to which the Issuers or any Affiliate thereof from time to time grants a Lien to the Trustee or the Holders or an agent or representative on their behalf to secure their obligations hereunder (collectively, the Security Documents) are Shared Security Documents, and that the Trustee is authorized and directed by each Holder to treat and the Trustee and each such Holder agrees that it will treat the same as Shared Security Documents under and as defi ned in

the Intercreditor Agreement and subject to the terms thereof for all purposes, including without limitation, for purposes of amending, modifying, varying or waiving any provision thereof, releasing any collateral thereunder, exercising any rights or remedies thereunder, directing the Collateral Agent thereunder to take any action thereunder or with respect thereto, and for purposes of sharing the proceeds of the collateral thereunder with the other First Lien Secured Parties.  In furtherance of the foregoing, the Trustee shall (and is hereby authorized to) take or instruct the Collateral Agent thereunder to take such actions under the Security Documents or related thereto as requested by the Required Secured Parties from time to time, and notwithstanding any provision in this Indenture to the contrary, unless all debt secured by the Security Documents has been Discharged, the Trustee will not release or instruct the Collateral Agent thereunder to release any Collateral unless such release has been consented to by each other Project Credit Party or such Collateral has been released from the Lien securing the obligations owed to all other First Lien Secured Parties.  The Holders hereby designate and direct the Trustee to designate, and the Trustee hereby designates Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas as its collateral agent to act as specified in and under the Intercreditor Agreement, this Indenture, the Security Documents and any other such documents or instruments entered into by Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (and its successors) as the collateral agent for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders.  In addition, regardless of whether required by the Intercreditor Agreement, each Holder hereby agrees that to the extent that the Holders obtain a recovery under a title insurance policy that insu res the Deeds of Trust, and such recovery would result in the Holders receiving a greater percentage recovery on the Notes (relative to the outstanding principal amount of the Notes) than the corresponding percentage recovery that will be obtained by the other First Lien Secured Parties that are parties to (or whose representative is party to) the Intercreditor Agreement as of the date of this Indenture (after giving effect to Section 8 of the Intercreditor Agreement and the title insurance proceeds received  by such other First Lien Secured Parties from their policies of title insurance) in connection with the exercise of remedies or other event or loss that gave rise to the recovery obtained by the Holders, then the Holders will turn over a portion of such proceeds to the Collateral Agent for distribution to such other First Lien Secured Parties in amounts necessary to ensure that each such party receives a similar percentage recovery (relative to the outstanding principal amount of First Lien Se cured Obligations then held by such party) from such proceeds.  The Issuers and the Guarantors hereby consent to the foregoing provisions and confirm that the Security Documents are and shall be treated as Shared Security Documents. Each Project Credit Party is an express beneficiary of this Section 10.01(b) and the provisions of this Section 10.01(b) may not be amended or modified without the consent of each Project Credit Party.

(4)           the construction of Stephen A. Wynns personal residence shall not materially interfere with the design, construction, operation or use of the remainder of the Golf Course Land and otherwise could not reasonably be expected to materially impair the overall value of the Projects,
 
(5)           the lenders under the Credit Agreement concurrently release their Liens on the Wynn Home Site Land,
 
(6)           no Points of Diversion with respect to any water permits held by Wynn Las Vegas or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or otherwise utilized or expected to utilized with respect to the Projects, wells associated therewith or rights-of-way necessary for the transportation to the Golf Course Land or the Wynn Las Vegas hotel and casino resort water entertainment features of water drawn or to be drawn pursuant to water permits, are located on the released Golf Course Land, or Wynn Golf shall have otherwise transferred or reserved for the benefit of the Golf Course Land (previously or in connection with such disposition) at no cost to Wynn Las Vegas and its Restricted Subsidiaries such easements as are necessary for Wynn Las Vegas and its Restricted Subsidiaries to (A) access such Points of Diversion, (B) own and operate such wells and (C) transport such water to the water features of the Project and/or the Golf Course,

(g)        The release of any Collateral from the terms of this Indenture and the Collateral Documents shall not be deemed to impair the security under this Indenture in contravention of the provisions hereof if and to the extent the Collateral is released pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Documents or this Indenture.  To the extent applicable, the Issuers shall cause TIA  313(b), relating to reports, and TIA  314(d), relating to the release of property or securities from the Lien and security interest of the Collateral Documents and this Indenture and relating to the substitution therefor of any property or securities to be subjected to the Lien and security interest of the Collateral Documents and this Indenture, to be complied with.

The Trustee may, to the extent permitted by Sections 7.01 and 7.02 hereof, accept as conclusive evidence of compliance with the foregoing provisions the appropriate statements contained in such documents and such Opinion of Counsel.
 
 
In the event that the Issuers wish to release Collateral in accordance with the Collateral Documents and have delivered the certificates and documents required by the Collateral Documents and Sections 10.03 and 10.04 hereof, the Trustee shall determine whether it has received all documentation required by TIA  314(d) in connection with such release and, based on such determination and the Opinion of Counsel delivered pursuant to Section 10.04(2) hereof, shall deliver a certificate to the Collateral Agent setting forth such determination.

The Trustee is authorized to receive any funds for the benefit of the Holders of Notes distributed under the Collateral Documents, and to make further distributions of such funds to the Holders of Notes according to the provisions of this Indenture.
 
 
(a)        So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and subject to the provisions of this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Collateral Documents, Wynn Las Vegas and each Guarantor shall be entitled to receive the benefit of all cash dividends, interest and other payments made upon or with respect to the Collateral pledged by such Person and to exercise any voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Collateral pledged by such Person.

Upon the payment in full in immediately available funds of all Obligations of the Issuers under this Indenture and the Notes, or upon Legal Defeasance, the Trustee shall, at the written request of the Issuers, deliver a certificate to the Collateral Agent stating that such Obligations have been paid in full, and instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Liens on the Collateral pursuant to this Indenture and the Collateral Documents and to take such actions at the Issuers sole cost and expense as the Issuers may reasonably request to evidence such release, including, without limitation, the return of assets pledged as Collateral and the execution and delivery of related instruments of transfer, lien, releases, reconveyances, termination statements and any similar documents and instruments.
 
 
 
(a)        Subject to this Article 11, each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the Notes, the Collateral Documents or the obligations of the Issuers hereunder or thereunder, that:
 
(1)           the principal of, premium and Liquidated Damages, if any, and interest on the Notes shall be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Issuers to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder shall be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and
 
(2)           in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, that same shall be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise.
 
Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately.  Each Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and performance and not a guarantee of collection.
 
(b)        The Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder are unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes, this Indenture or the Collateral Documents, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any
 
 
126
 
 
judgment against the Issuers, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor.  Each of the Guarantors hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of either Issuer, any right to require a proceeding first against the Issuers, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenant that this Note Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and this Indenture.  Each Guarantor waives any right or claims of right to cause a marshalling of the Issuers or any Guarantors assets or to proceed against any Guarantor, any Issuer or any other guarantor of any Obliga tions that are Guaranteed in any particular order, including, but not limited to, any right arising out of Nevada Revised Statutes 40.430, to the fullest extent permitted by Nevada Revised Statutes 40.495(2).
 
(c)        If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Issuers, the Guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either Issuer or any Guarantor, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Note Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect.
 
(d)        Each of the Guarantors agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby.  Each of the Guarantors further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (1) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 hereof for the purposes of this Note Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (2) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 6 hereof, such obligations (wheth er or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Note Guarantee.  The Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor, as the case may be, so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Note Guarantee.
 
 
Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any Note Guarantee.  To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of each such Guarantor shall be limited to the maximum amount that shall, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor, as the case may be, that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article 11, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Note Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
 
 
127
 
 
 
To evidence its Note Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01, each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that a notation of such Note Guarantee substantially in the form attached as Exhibit E hereto shall be endorsed by an Officer of such Guarantor on each Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and that this Indenture shall be executed on behalf of such Guarantor by one of its Officers.
 
Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that its Note Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Note a notation of such Note Guarantee.
 
If an Officer whose signature is on this Indenture or on the Note Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note on which a Note Guarantee is endorsed, the Note Guarantee shall be valid nevertheless.
 
The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the Note Guarantee set forth in this Indenture on behalf of the Guarantors.
 
In the event that the Issuers create or acquire any Subsidiary after the date of this Indenture, if required by Sections 4.21 and 4.25 hereof, the Issuers shall cause such Subsidiary to comply with the provisions of Sections 4.21 and 4.25 hereof and this Article 11, to the extent applicable.

(1)           immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and
 
(2)           either:
 
  (A)           the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger assumes all the obligations of that Guarantor under this Indenture, its Note Guarantee and the Registration Rights Agreement pursuant to a supplemental indenture and other appropriate documents satisfactory to the Trustee; or
 
  (B)           the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with Section 4.10 hereof.
 
(b)        In case of any consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance of or involving a Guarantor under this Section 11.04 hereof, and upon the assumption by the successor Person, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the
 
 
128
 
 
Trustee, of the Note Guarantee endorsed upon the Notes and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by the Guarantor, such successor Person shall succeed to and be substituted for the Guarantor with the same effect as if it had been named herein as a Guarantor.  Such successor Person thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Note Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the Notes issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Issuers and delivered to the Trustee.  All the Note Guarantees so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Note Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Note Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.
 
(c)           Except as set forth in Articles 4 and 5 hereof, nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the Notes shall prevent any consolidation or merger of a Guarantor with or into the Issuers or another Guarantor, or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of a Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Issuers or another Guarantor.

Upon delivery by Wynn Las Vegas to the Trustee of an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such sale or other disposition was made by the Issuers in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, including, without limitation, Section 4.10 hereof, the Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence the release of any Guarantor from its obligations under its Note Guarantee.

(b)        in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) an Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas, if the sale or other disposition is made in compliance with Section 4.10 hereof, and if, after giving effect to such sale or other disposition, such Guarantor is an Immaterial Subsidiary;
 
(c)        in connection with any sale or other disposition of all of the Capital Stock of that Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) an Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas, if the sale or other disposition does not violate Section 4.10 hereof;

(a)        either:
 
(1)           all Notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the Issuers, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
 
(2)           all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation will become due and payable by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise
 
 
130

If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or Government Securities in accordance with Section 12.01 by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Issuers and any Guarantors obligations under this Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral Documents shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 12.01; provided that if the Issuers have made any payment of principal of, premium or Liquidated Damages, if any, or interest on any Notes

(a)        Notwithstanding any contrary provision contained in this Indenture, the Notes and the Collateral Documents to which both of the Issuers are a party, the covenants, agreements and obligations of the Issuers, and either of them, shall be deemed joint and several obligations of the Issuers.

any other Person, regardless of whether a Beneficiary has reason to believe that any such facts materially increase the risk beyond that which such Issuer intends to assume, or has reason to believe that such facts are unknown to such Issuer, or has a reasonable opportunity to communicate such facts to the either Issuer, because each Issuer acknowledges that each Issuer is fully responsible for being and keeping informed of the financial condition of each of the Issuers or any other Person and of all circumstances bearing on the risk of non payment of any Note Obligations, (viii) any defense arising because of the election of a Beneficiary, in any proceeding instituted under the Bankruptcy Law, of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Law, (ix) any defense based upon any borrowing or grant of a security interes t under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Law, (x) any claim or other rights which it may now or hereafter acquire against the other Issuer or any other Person that arises from the existence of performance of each Issuer of its obligations under this Indenture, the Notes or any Collateral Document, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification, any right to participate in any claim or remedy by a Beneficiary against the other Issuer or any collateral which a Beneficiary now has or hereafter acquires, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from either of the Issuers or any other Person, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim or other rights, (xi) any rights which it may acquire by way of c ontribution under this Indenture, the Notes or any Collateral Document, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from any other Person, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such contribution rights, and (xii) any defense based on one action laws and any other anti deficiency protections granted to guarantors by applicable law.

Wynn Las Vegas or (c) any group of Restricted Subsidiaries of Wynn Las Vegas that, taken together, all outstanding Notes shall become due and payable immediately without further action or notice.  If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately.  Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and in the other Collateral Documents.  Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power.  However, as long as any Indebtedness is outstanding und er the Credit Agreement or any of the 2014 Notes remain outstanding, the Holders will not have any right to direct the Collateral Agent to enforce remedies against the Collateral.  The Trustee may withhold from Holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal or interest or premium or Liquidated Damages, if any.  The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes, waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or premium or Liquidated Damages, if any, on, or the principal of, the Notes.  The Issuers are required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture and the Collateral Documents.  Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Issuers are required to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.
 
(14)        .  The Indenture authorizes the Trustee to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement on behalf of itself and the Holders of the Notes.  The Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes to exercise certain rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral.  Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the agent under the Credit Agreement will have the right, subject to certain limited exceptions, to direct the Collateral Agent to enter into amendments of, or waive defaults under, the Collateral Documents that grant Liens on the Collateral without obtaining consent of the Trustee or the Holders of the Notes.  At any time whe n at least $100.0 million in Indebtedness remains outstanding under the Credit Agreement, the agent under the Credit Agreement will also have the right to amend the Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Trustee or the Holders of the Notes, so long as such amendment only affects the subordination provisions in respect of any junior Indebtedness but does not affect the provisions governing the relationship between the lenders under the Credit Agreement and the Holders of the Notes.
Intercreditor Agreement
 
(15)        .  The Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Issuers or any Affiliate of the Issuers with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.  However, in the event that the Trustee acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to continue as trustee or resign.  Any Agent may do the same with like rights and duties.  The Trustee is also subject to Sections 7.10 and 7.11 of the Indenture.

provided
however
 
(b)           Each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Issuers and the Guarantors, and their respective members, managers, directors and officers, and each person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Issuers, or the Guarantors to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Issuers and the Guarantors set forth in section (a) above, but only with reference to information included in the Registration Statement or any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information expressly furnished to the Issuers by or on behalf of such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement.  In no event shall any Holder, its directors, officers or any Person who controls such Holder be liable or responsible for any amount in excess of the amount by which the total amount received by such Holder with respect to its sale of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds (i) the amount paid by such Holder for such Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) the amount of any damages that such Holder, its directors, officers or any Person who controls such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact.  The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability that the each Holder may otherwise have to the Issuers and the Guarantors.
 
 
18
 
(c)           In case any action shall be commenced involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b) (the ), the indemnified party shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the ) in writing and the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such action, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and the payment of all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, as incurred (except that in the case of any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to both Sections 8(a) and 8(b), a Holder shall not be required to assume the defense of such action pursuant to this Section 8(c), but may employ separate counsel and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel, except as provided below, shall be at the expense of the Holder).  Any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such action or employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and the indemnified part y shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party).  In any such case, the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties and all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Such firm shall be designated in writing by a majority of the Holders, in the case of the parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Issuers and the Guarantors, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8 (b). The indemnifying party shall indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments by reason of any settlement of any action (i) effected with the indemnifying partys written consent or (ii) effected without the indemnifying partys written consent, if the settlement is entered into more than 30 business days after the indemnifying party shall have received a request from the indemnified party for reimbursement for the fees and expenses of counsel (in any case where such fees and expenses are at the expense of the indemnifying party) and, prior to the date of such settlement, the indemnifying party shall have failed to comply with such reimbursement request.   No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of  judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action in respect of which the indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity or contribution may be or could have been sought hereunder by the indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability on claims that are or could have been the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party.

(d)           To the extent that the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments
 
 
19
 
referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuers and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, from their sale of Transfer Restricted Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Issuers and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and of the Holder, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resul ted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative fault of the Issuers and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and of the Holder, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such Issuer or such Guarantor, on the one hand, or by the Holder, on the other hand, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(a), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any ac tion or claim.
 
The Issuers, the Guarantors and each Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any matter, including any action that could have given rise to such losses, cl aims, damages, liabilities or judgments.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Holder, its directors, its officers or any Person, if any, who controls such Holder shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the total received by such Holder with respect to the sale of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds (i) the amount paid by such Holder for such Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Holders obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(c) are se veral in proportion to the respective principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities held by each Holder hereunder and not joint.
 
SECTION 9.      RULE 144A AND RULE 144
 
Each Issuer and each Guarantor agrees with each Holder, for so long as any Transfer Restricted Securities remain outstanding and during any period in which such Issuer and such
 
 
20
 
Guarantor (i) is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to make available, upon request of any Holder, to such Holder or beneficial owner of Transfer Restricted Securities in connection with any sale thereof and any prospective purchaser of such Transfer Restricted Securities designated by such Holder or beneficial owner, the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Act in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144A, and (ii) is subject to Section 13 or 15 (d) of the Exchange Act, to make all filings required thereby in a timely manner in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144.
 
SECTION 10.    MISCELLANEOUS
 
(a)           .  The Issuers and the Guarantors acknowledge and agree that any failure by the Issuers and/or the Guarantors to comply with their respective obligations under Sections 3 and 4 hereof may result in material irreparable injury to the Dealer Managers or the Holders for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Dealer Managers or any Holder may obtain such relief as may be required to specifically enforce the Issuers and the Guarantors obligations under Sections 3 and 4 hereof.  The Issuers and the Guarantors further agree to waive the def ense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate.
Remedies
 
(b)           .

The Issuers and the Guarantors represent and warrant to the Holders and the Dealer Managers that the rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of the Issuers and the Guarantors securities under any agreement in effect on the date hereof.
No Inconsistent Agreements
 
(c)           .  The provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to or departures from the provisions hereof may not be given unless (i) in the case of Section 5 hereof and this Section 10(c)(i), the Issuers have obtained the written consent of Holders of all outstanding Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) in the case of all other provisions hereof, the Issuers have obtained the written consent of Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities (excluding Transfer Restricted Securities held by the Issuers or their Affiliates).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to or departure from the provisions hereof that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose Transfer Restricted Securities are being tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer, and that does not affect, directly or indirectly, the rights of other Holders whose Transfer Restricted Securities are not being tendered pursuant to such Exchange Offer, may be given by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities subject to such Exchange Offer.
Amendments and Waivers
