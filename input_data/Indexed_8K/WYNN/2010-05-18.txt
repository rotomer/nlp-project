On May 12, 2010, Worldwide Wynn, LLC (WW), a wholly owned subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, Limited (WRL), entered into a new employment agreement with Linda Chen, WWs Chief Operating Officer of Wynn Resorts (Macau) S.A. (Wynn Macau).  Concurrently with the execution of her new employment agreement with WW, Ms. Chen and WW terminated Ms. Chens previous employment agreement with WW.  The new agreement is effective as of February 25, 2010, and will terminate on February 24, 2020.  The agreement provides for a base salary of $1,500,000 per year, which shall be subject to performance reviews and may be increased, but not decreased, as a result of such performance reviews . Ms. Chen will also be eligible to receive a bonus as determined in accordance with WRLs Annual Performance Based Incentive Plan for Executive Officers.
 
The new employment agreement provides that Ms. Chen will be entitled to (i) participate, to the extent that she is otherwise eligible, in all employee benefit plans that WW maintains for its executives; and (ii) receive reimbursement for reasonable business expenses. Under the new employment agreement, Wynn Macau has agreed to purchase Ms. Chen a home in Macau costing approximately $5.4 million and to provide Ms. Chen the use of an automobile in Macau.  Ms. Chen shall have the option to purchase the home at a percentage of the fair market value of the home, that is reduced by ten percent per year during the term of the agreement (the Discount Percentage).  The option is exercisable for (a) no consideration at th e end of the term, (b) $1.00 in the event of termination of Ms. Chens employment without cause or termination of Ms. Chens employment for good reason following a change of control, and (c) at a price based on the applicable Discount Percentage in the event Ms. Chen terminates the agreement due to material breach by WW.  Upon Ms. Chens termination for cause, Ms. Chen will be deemed to have elected to purchase the Macau home based on the applicable Discount Percentage unless WW determines to not require Ms. Chen to purchase the home.  If Ms. Chens employment terminates for any other reason before the expiration of the term (e.g., because of her death or disability or due to revocation of gaming license), the option will terminate.
 
If Ms. Chen is terminated without cause (as this term is defined in the agreement), subject to Ms. Chens execution of a release of claims, she will be entitled a separation payment equal to the sum of the following: (a) her base salary for the remainder of the term of the employment agreement, up to a maximum of four years (but in no event less than one year); (b) the bonus that was paid to Ms. Chen for the preceding bonus period, projected over the remainder of the term of the employment agreement, up to a maximum of four years; and (c) a gross-up payment for excise taxes on the separation payment.  This separation payment is payable in equal monthly installments for the period covered by such paymen ts.
If Ms. Chen is terminated for good reason following a change of control (as these terms are defined in the agreement), or if WW materially breaches the employment agreement, WW will pay Ms. Chen a separation payment in a lump sum equal to the sum of the following: (a) her base salary for the remainder of the term of the employment agreement, up to a maximum of four years (but in no event less than one year); (b) the bonus that was paid to Ms. Chen for the preceding bonus period, projected over the remainder of the term of the employment agreement, up to a maximum of four years; and (c) a gross-up payment for excise taxes on the separation payment.
 
If Ms. Chens employment terminates for any other reason before the expiration of the term (e.g., because of her death, disability, discharge for cause or revocation of gaming license), WW will pay her only her base salary and any accrued but unpaid vacation pay through the termination date.
Ms. Chens new employment agreement also provides for confidential information, trade secrets and works of authorship provisions, as well as non-competition and non-solicitation provisions.

21.
DISPUTE RESOLUTION
(a)           Coverage of Arbitration Agreement:   The promises by Employer and Employee to arbitrate differences, rather than litigate them before courts or other bodies, provide consideration for each other, in addition to other consideration provided under the Agreement.  The parties contemplate by this Section 21 arbitration of all clams against each of them to the fullest extent permitted by law except as specifically excluded by this
 
17
 
 
Agreement.  Only claims that are justiciable or arguably justiciable under applicable federal, state or local law are covered by this Section, and include, without limitation, any and all alleged violations of any federal, state or local law whether common law, statutory, arising under regulation or ordinance, or any other law, brought by any current or former employee.  Such claims may include, but are not limited to, claims for: wages or other compensation; breach of contract; torts; work-related injury claims not covered under workers compensation laws; wrongful discharge; and any and all unlawful employment discrimination and/or harassment claims.  This Section 21 excludes claims under state workers compensation or unemployment compensation statutes; claims pertaining to any of Employ ers employee welfare, insurance, benefit, and pension plans, with respect to which are applicable the filing and appeal procedures of such plans shall apply to any denial of benefits; and claims for injunctive or equitable relief for violations of non-competition and/or confidentiality agreements in Sections 9, 10 and 11.
(b)           Waiver of Rights to Pursue Claims in Court and to Jury Trial: This Section 21 does not in any manner waive any rights or remedies available under applicable statutes or common law, but does waive Employers and Employee's rights to pursue those rights and remedies in a judicial forum and waive any right to trial by jury of any claims covered by this Section 21(a).  By signing this Agreement, the parties voluntarily agree to arbitrate any covered claims against each other.  In the event of any administrative or judicial action by any agency or third party to adjudicate, on behalf of Employee, a claim subject to arbitration, Employee hereby waives the right to participate in any monetary or other recovery obtained by such agency or third p arty in any such action, and Employee's sole remedy with respect to any such claim will be any award decreed by an arbitrator pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.
(c)           Initiation of Arbitration:  To commence arbitration of a claim subject to this Section 21, the aggrieved party must, within the time frame provided in Section 21(d) below, make written demand for arbitration and provide written notice of that demand to the other party. If a claim is brought by Employee against Employer, such notice shall be given to Employers Legal Department.  Such written notice must identify and describe the nature of the claim, the supporting facts, and the relief or remedy sought.  In the event that either party files an action in any court to pursue any of the claims covered by this Section 21, the complaint, petition or other initial pleading commencing such court action shall be considered the demand f or arbitration.  In such event, the other party may move that court to compel arbitration.
(d)           Time Limit to Initiate Arbitration: To ensure timely resolution of disputes, Employee and Employer must initiate arbitration within the statute of limitations (deadline for filing) provided by applicable law pertaining to the claim, or one year, whichever is shorter, except that the
 
 
18
 
statute of limitations imposed by relevant law will solely apply in circumstances where such statute of limitations cannot legally be shortened by private agreement. The failure to initiate arbitration within this time limit will bar any such claim.  The parties understand that Employer and Employee are waiving any longer statutes of limitations that would otherwise apply, and any aggrieved party is encouraged to give written notice of any claim as soon as possible after the event(s) in dispute so that arbitration of any differences may take place promptly.
(e)           Arbitrator Selection:  The parties contemplate that, except as specifically set forth in this Section 21, selection of one (1) arbitrator shall take place pursuant to the then-current rules of the AAA applicable to employment disputes.  The arbitrator must be either a retired judge or an attorney experienced in employment law. The parties will select one arbitrator from among a list of qualified neutral arbitrators provided by AAA.  If the parties are unable to agree on the arbitrator, the parties will select an arbitrator by alternatively striking names from a list of qualified arbitrators provided by AAA.  AAA will flip a coin to determine which party has the final strike (that is, when the list has been narrowed by strik ing to two arbitrators). The remaining named arbitrator will be selected.
(f)           Arbitration Rights and Procedures:  Employee may be represented by an attorney of his/her choice at his/her own expense.  Any arbitration hearing or proceeding will take place in private, not open to the public, in Clark County, Nevada.  The arbitrator shall apply the substantive law (and the law of remedies, if applicable) of Nevada (without regard to its choice of law provisions) and/or federal law when applicable. The arbitrator is without power or jurisdiction to apply any different substantive law or law of remedies or to modify any term or condition of this Agreement.  The arbitrator will have no power or authority to award non-economic damages or punitive damages except where such relief is specifically authorized by an applicable federal, state or local statute or ordinance, or common law.  In such a situation, the arbitrator shall specify in the award the specific statute or other basis under which such relief is granted.    The applicable law with respect to privilege, including attorney-client privilege, work product, and offers to compromise must be followed.   The parties will have the right to conduct reasonable discovery, including written and oral (deposition) discovery and to subpoena and/or request copies of records, documents and other relevant discoverable information consistent with the procedural rules of AAA.  The arbitrator will decide disputes regarding the scope of discovery and will have authority to regulate the conduct of any hearing.  The arbitrator will have the right to entertain a motion or request to dismiss, for summary judgment, or for other summary disposition.   The parties will exchange witness lists at least 30 days prior to the hearing.  The arbitrator will have subpoena power so that either Employee or Employer may summon witnesses.  The arbitrator will use the Federal Rules of Evidence in connection with the admission of all evidence at the hearing.  Both parties shall have the right
 
 
19
 
to file post-hearing briefs.  Any party, at its own expense, may arrange for and pay the cost of a court reporter to provide a stenographic record of the proceedings.
(g)           Arbitrators Award: The arbitrator will issue a written decision containing the specific issues raised by the parties, the specific findings of fact, and the specific conclusions of law.  The award will be rendered promptly, typically within 30 days after conclusion of the arbitration hearing, or after the submission of post-hearing briefs if requested.  The arbitrator shall have no power or authority to award any relief or remedy in excess of what a court could grant under applicable law.  The arbitrators decision shall be final and binding on both parties.  Judgment upon an award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.
(h)           Fees and Expenses:  Unless the law requires otherwise for a particular claim or claims, the party demanding arbitration bears the responsibility for payment of the fee to file with AAA and the fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be allocated by the AAA under its rules and procedures. Employee and Employer shall each pay his/her/its own expenses for presentation of their cases, including but not limited to attorneys fees, costs, and fees for witnesses, photocopying and other preparation expenses.  If any party prevails on a statutory claim that affords the prevailing party attorneys fees and costs, the arbitrator may award reasonable attorneys fees and/or costs to the prevailing party, applying the same standards a co urt would apply under the law applicable to the claim.
          This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Employer and Employee, and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements, undertakings or severance policies or plans by and between Employer or its Affiliates, on the one side, and Employee, on the other side, with respect to its subject matter or Employees employment with Employer or its Affiliates.   As of the Effective Date, this Agreement supersedes and replaces any and all prior employment agreements (including, but not limited to, any prior Employment Agreement), change in control agreements and severance plans or agreements, whether written or oral, by and between Employee, on the one side, and Employer or any of Employers Affiliates, on the other side, or under which Employee is a participant.  From and after the Effective Date, Employee shall be employed by Employer under the terms and pursuant to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF AND INTENDING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND THEREBY,

(a)           Employer shall indemnify and hold Employee harmless from and against any and all liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, attorney's fees and costs) which Employee may incur as a result of the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) or any similar provision of state or local income tax law (the "Excise Tax"), to the end that Employee shall be placed in the same tax position with respect to the Severance Payment under Employees Employment Agreement and all other payments from Employer to Employee in the nature of compensation as Employee would have been in if the Excise Tax had never been enacted.  In furtherance of such indemnification, Employer shall pay to Employee a payment (the "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that, after payment by Employee of all taxes, including income taxes and the Excise Tax imposed on the Gross-Up Payment and any interest or penalties (other than interest and penalties imposed by reason of Employees failure to file timely tax returns or to pay taxes shown due on such returns and any tax liability, including interest and penalties, unrelated to the Excise Tax or the Gross-Up Amount), Employee shall be placed in the same tax position with respect to the Severance Payment under this Plan and all other payments from Employer to Employee in the nature of compensation as Employee would have been in if the Excise Tax had never been enacted.  When Employer pays Employees Severance Payment, it shall also pay to Employee a Gross-Up Payment for the Severance Payment and any other payments in the nature of compensation that Employer determines are "excess parachute payments" under Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code ("Exce ss Parachute Payments").  If, through a determination of the Internal Revenue Service or any state or local taxing authority (a "Taxing Authority"), or a judgment of any court, Employee becomes liable for an amount of Excise Tax not covered by the Gross-Up Payment payable pursuant to the preceding sentence, Employer shall pay Employee an additional Gross-Up Payment to make Employee whole for such additional Excise Tax; provided, however, that, pursuant to Section (c) of this Exhibit 1, Employer shall have the right to require Employee to protest, contest, or appeal any such determination or judgment.  For purposes of this Exhibit 1, any amount that Employer is required to withhold under Sections 3402 or 4999 of the Code or under any other provision of law shall be deemed to have been paid to Employee.
 
(b)           Upon payment to Employee of a Gross-Up Payment, Employer shall provide Employee with a written statement showing Employer's computation of such Gross-Up Payment and the Excess Parachute Payments and Excise Tax to which it relates, and setting forth Employer's determination of the amount of gross income Employee is required to recognize as a result of such payments and Employees liability for the Excise Tax.  Employee shall cause his or her federal, state, and local income tax returns for the period in which Employee receive such Gross-Up Payment to be prepared and filed in accordance with such statement, and, upon such filing, Employee shall certify in writing to Employer that such returns have been so prepared and filed.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section (a) of this Exhibit 1, Employer shall not be obligated to indemnify Employee from and against any tax liability, cost or expense (including, without limitation, any liability for the Excise Tax or attorney's fees or costs)
 
 
22
 
 
 
to the extent such tax liability, cost or expense is attributable to your failure to comply with the provisions of this Section (b).
 
(c)           If any controversy arises between Employee and a Taxing Authority with respect to the treatment on any return of the Gross-Up Amount, or of any payment Employee receives from Employer as an Excess Parachute Payment, or with respect to any return which a Taxing Authority asserts should show an Excess Parachute Payment, including, without limitation, any audit, protest to an appeals authority of a Taxing Authority or litigation (a "Controversy"), Employer shall have the right to participate with Employee in the handling of such Controversy.  Employer shall have the right, solely with respect to a Controversy, to direct Employee to protest or contest any proposed adjustment or deficiency, initiate an appeals procedure within any Taxing Authority, commence an y judicial proceeding, make any settlement agreement, or file a claim for refund of tax, and Employee shall not take any of such steps without the prior written approval of Employer, which Employer shall not unreasonably withhold.  If Employer so elects, Employee shall be represented in any Controversy by attorneys, accountants, and other advisors selected by Employer, and Employer shall pay the fees, costs and expenses of such attorneys, accountants, or advisors, and any tax liability Employee may incur as a result of such payment.  Employee shall promptly notify Employer of any communication with a Taxing Authority, and Employee shall promptly furnish to Employer copies of any written correspondence, notices, or documents received from a Taxing Authority relating to a Controversy. Employee shall cooperate fully with Employer in the handling of any Controversy by furnishing Employer any information or documentation relating to or bearing upon the Controversy; , , that Employee shall not be obligated to furnish to Employer copies of any portion of his or her tax returns which do not bear upon, and are not affected by, the Controversy.

(d)           Employee shall pay over to Employer, within ten (10) days after receipt thereof, any refund Employee receive from any Taxing Authority of all or any portion of the Gross-Up Payment or the Excise Tax, together with any interest Employee receive from such Taxing Authority on such refund.  For purposes of this Section (d), a reduction in Employees tax liability attributable to the previous payment of the Gross-Up Amount or the Excise Tax shall be deemed to be a refund.  If Employee would have received a refund of all or any portion of the Gross-Up Payment or the Excise Tax, except that a Taxing Authority offset the amount of such refund against other tax liabilities, interest, or penalties, Employee shall pay the amount of such offset over t o Employer, together with the amount of interest Employee would have received from the Taxing Authority if such offset had been an actual refund, within ten (10) days after receipt of notice from the Taxing Authority of such offset.
