Item 8.01     Other Events.
On December 2, 2010, two of Wynn Resorts, Limiteds wholly owned subsidiaries, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp. (together, the Issuers), completed their offer to exchange up to $1,320,000,000 of their outstanding 7% First Mortgage Notes issued on August 4, 2010 due 2020 (the Original Notes) for 7% First Mortgage Notes due 2020 that have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the New Notes).  The exchange offer was made in order to satisfy certain obligations of the Issuers contained in a Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of August 4, 2010.
The exchange offer expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 29, 2010.  All $1,320,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Original Notes were exchanged.  The New Notes are substantially identical to the Original Notes, except that the New Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and, as a result, the transfer restrictions and registration rights provisions applicable to the Original Notes do not apply to the New Notes.
