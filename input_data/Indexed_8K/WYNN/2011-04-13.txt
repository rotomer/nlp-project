Management Discussion and Analysis
OVERVIEW
Wynn Macau opened to the public on 6 September 2006 at the center of casino activities on the urban Macau peninsula. In December 2007 and November 2009, Wynn Macau completed expansions, adding more gaming space and additional food and beverage and retail amenities. Encore at Wynn Macau, a further expansion of Wynn Macau that adds a fully integrated resort hotel with, among other offerings, 410 luxury suites and four villas, additional gaming space, restaurants and retail space, opened on 21 April 2010. As at 31 December 2010, Wynn Macau and Encore occupied approximately 16 acres of land in Macau featuring casino areas of approximately 256,000 square feet offering 24-hour gaming with a full range of games and 1,009 luxury rooms and suites.
For the year ended 31 December 2010, our total operating revenues were HK$22.4 billion, and our net profit was HK$4.4 billion, a 59.4% increase over total operating revenues of HK$14.1 billion, and a 113.8% increase over net profit of HK$2.1 billion for the year ended 31 December 2009.
Macau
Macau, which was a territory under Portuguese administration for approximately 450 years, was transferred from Portuguese to Chinese political control in December 1999. Macau is governed as a special administrative region of China and is located approximately 37 miles southwest of, and less than one hour away via ferry from, Hong Kong. Macau, which has been a casino destination for more than 40 years, consists principally of a peninsula on mainland China, and two neighboring islands, Taipa and Coloane. We believe that Macau is located in one of the world's largest concentrations of potential gaming customers. According to Macau Statistical Information, casinos in Macau generated approximately HK$182.9 billion in gaming revenue during the year ended 31 December 2010, an increase of approximately 57.8% over the approximate HK$115.9 billion generated in the year ended 31 December 2009, making Macau the largest gaming market in the world.
Macau's gaming market is primarily dependent on tourists. The Macau market has experienced tremendous growth in capacity in the last few years. As at 31 December 2010, there were 20,091 hotel rooms and 4,791 table games in Macau, compared to 12,978 hotel rooms and 2,760 table games as at 31 December 2006.
 
Annual Report 2010 7
Management Discussion and Analysis
Wynn Macau
We opened Wynn Macau on 6 September 2006 and completed expansions of the resort in December 2007 and November 2009. Wynn Macau features:
an approximately 222,000 square foot casino offering 24-hour gaming and a full range of games, including private gaming salons, a sky casino and a poker area;
luxury hotel accommodations in 595 rooms and suites;
casual and fine dining in six restaurants;
a retail promenade occupying approximately 48,000 square feet featuring high-end, brand- name retail stores and boutiques such as Bvlgari, Chanel, Christian Dior, Dunhill, Ermenegildo Zegna, Fendi, Ferrari, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Hermes, Hugo Boss, Louis Vuitton, Miu Miu, Piaget, Prada, Rolex, Tiffany, Tudor, Van Cleef & Arpels, Versace, Vertu and others;
recreation and leisure facilities, including a health club, pool and a full service luxury spa;
lounges and meeting facilities; and
a performance lake and rotunda show.
Encore
We opened Encore on 21 April 2010. While Encore is a destination in itself, it is also complemented by, and fully integrated with, the existing operations and facilities at Wynn Macau. We believe we have further solidified Wynn Macau's position as a premier destination for VIP clients in Macau as well as enhanced our offerings to mass market clients with the addition of the following at Encore:
an approximately 34,000 square foot casino offering 24-hour gaming and a full range of games, including private gaming salons and a sky casino;
370 luxury suites of approximately 1,000 square feet each and 40 luxury suites of approximately 2,000 square feet each;
four villas of approximately 7,000 square feet, each connected to private gaming salons;
approximately 3,200 square feet of high-end retail space featuring Chanel, Piaget and Cartier;
two restaurants and one lounge; and
a full service luxury spa.
 
Management Discussion and Analysis
The following table presents certain information about the number of casino games available at Wynn Macau and Encore:
As at 31 December
2010 2009
VIP table games 238 196
Mass market table games 225 198
Slot machines 1,013 1,195
Poker tables 11 11
In response to our evaluation of our operations and the feedback from our guests, we have been, and will continue to make enhancements and refinements to this resort complex.
Cotai Development
The Group has applied to the Macau government for a land concession on approximately 52 acres of land on Cotai and is awaiting final approval by the Macau government on the concession. We continue to work on the concept and design of this property, but cannot prepare a final timeline or budget until the Macau government approval of the land concession is received.
Cotai Land Agreement
On 1 August 2008, Palo Real Estate Company Limited entered into an agreement with a Macau incorporated company that is not a connected person of the Group to pay the latter for its relinquishment of certain rights in and to any future development on the approximately 52 acres of land on Cotai.
FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Tourism
The levels of tourism and overall gaming activities in Macau are key drivers of our business. Both the Macau gaming market and visitation to Macau have grown significantly in the last few years. We have benefited from the rise in visitation to Macau over the past several years.
 
Annual Report 2010 9
Management Discussion and Analysis
Gaming customers traveling to Macau typically come from nearby destinations in Asia including Hong Kong, mainland China, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. According to the Macau Statistics and Census Service Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, approximately 88% of visitors to Macau in 2010 were from Hong Kong, mainland China and Taiwan. We believe that visitation and gross gaming revenue growth for the Macau market have been, and will continue to be, driven by a combination of factors, including the level of regional wealth in Asia which, should it continue to increase, is expected to lead to a large and growing middle class with rising disposable income; Macau's proximity to major Asian population centers; infrastructure improvements that are expected to facilitate more convenient travel to and within Macau; and the increasing supply of better quality casino, hotel and entertainment offerings in Macau.
Tourism levels in Macau are affected by a number of factors, all of which are beyond our control. Key factors affecting tourism levels in Macau may include, among others:
Prevailing economic conditions in China and Asia;
Various countries' policies on the issuance of travel visas that may be in place from time to time and could affect travel to Macau;
Competition from other destinations which offer gaming and leisure activities;
Possible changes to government restrictions on currency conversion or the ability to export currency from China or other countries; and
Possible outbreaks of infectious disease.
Economic and Operating Environment
Our operating environment remained stable in 2010. However, economic conditions can have a significant impact on our business. A number of factors, including a slowdown in the global economy, contracting credit markets, reduced consumer spending, various countries' policies that affect travel to Macau and any outbreak of infections diseases can negatively impact the gaming industry in Macau and our business.
 
10 Wynn Macau, Limited
Management Discussion and Analysis
Competition
Since the liberalization of Macau's gaming industry in 2002, there has been a significant increase in the number of gaming operators and casino properties in Macau. Currently, there are six gaming operators in Macau, including WRM. The three concessionaires are WRM, Galaxy and SJM. The three subconcessionaires are Venetian Macau, Melco Crown, and MGM Macau. As at 31 December 2010, there were approximately 33 casinos in Macau, including 20 operated by SJM. Each of the current six operators has operating casinos and several expansion plans announced or underway.
Wynn Macau also faces competition from casinos located in other areas of Asia, such as Genting Highlands Resort, a major gaming and resort destination located outside of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and casinos in the Philippines. Two large-scale casinos in Singapore, which opened in February 2010 and in April 2010, have added further competition to the region. Wynn Macau also encounters competition from other major gaming centers located around the world, including Australia and Las Vegas, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming, and other casinos throughout Asia. Further, if current efforts to legalize gaming in other Asian countries are successful, Wynn Macau will face additional regional competition.
Gaming Promoters
A significant amount of our casino play is brought to us by gaming promoters. Gaming promoters have historically played a critical role in the Macau gaming market and are important to Wynn Macau's casino business.
Gaming promoters introduce high-spending VIP players to Wynn Macau and often assist those clients with their travel and entertainment arrangements. In addition, gaming promoters often grant credit to their players. In exchange for their services, Wynn Macau pays the gaming promoters a fixed percentage of the gross gaming win generated by each gaming promoter. This percentage has remained stable since 2006. Approximately 80% of these commissions are netted against casino revenues, because such commissions approximate the amount of the commission returned to the VIP players by the gaming promoters, and approximately 20% of these commissions are included in other operating expenses, which approximate the amount of the commission ultimately retained by the gaming promoters for their compensation. The total amount of commissions netted against casino revenues were HK$5.8 billion and HK$3.4 billion for the year ended 31 December 2010 and 2009, respectively. Commissions increased 69.7% for the year ended 31 December 2010 compared to the year ended 31 December 2009 due to increased volumes of play generated by gaming promoters and the addition of three new gaming promoters. Additionally, gaming promoters each receive a monthly complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the turnover their clients generate.
 
Annual Report 2010 11
Management Discussion and Analysis
The allowance is available for room, food and beverage and other products and services for discretionary use with clients. We typically advance commissions to gaming promoters at the beginning of each month to facilitate their working capital requirements. These advances are provided to a gaming promoter and are offset by the commissions earned by such gaming promoter during the applicable month. The aggregate amounts of exposure to our gaming promoters, which is the difference between commissions advanced to each individual gaming promoter, and the commissions payable to each such gaming promoter, were HK$246.3 million and HK$127.7 million as at 31 December 2010 and 2009, respectively. Outstanding commissions advanced during a month to a gaming promoter are always cleared no later than the fifth day of the succeeding month and prior to the advancement of any further funds to a gaming promoter. We believe we have developed strong relationships with our gaming promoters. Our commission levels have remained stable throughout our operating history and we have not increased levels of commissions paid to gaming promoters.
In August 2009, the Macau government published, in its official gazette, certain guidelines with respect to caps on the commission rates payable to gaming promoters that became effective on 1 December 2009. Further changes or tightening of caps may occur and if the Macau government were to implement caps on commission rates payable to gaming promoters that cause WRM to pay gaming promoters effectively less than what WRM currently pays, gaming promoters may have less incentive to bring travelers to casinos in Macau, including Wynn Macau.
High-End Credit Play
We selectively extend credit to players contingent upon our marketing team's knowledge of the players, their financial background and payment history. We follow a series of credit procedures and require from each credit recipient various signed documents that are intended to ensure among other things that, if permitted by applicable law, the debt can be legally enforced in the jurisdiction where the player resides. In the event the player does not reside in a jurisdiction where gaming debts are legally enforceable, we often can assert jurisdiction over assets the player maintains in jurisdictions where gaming debts are recognized. In addition, we typically require a check in the amount of the applicable credit line from credit players, collateralizing the credit we grant to a player.
Number and Mix of Table Games and Slot Machines
The mix of VIP table games, mass table games and slot machines in operation at Wynn Macau and Encore changes from time to time as a result of marketing and operating strategies in response to changing market demand and industry competition. The shift in the mix of Wynn Macau's and Encore's games will affect casino profitability.

ADJUSTED EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before finance costs, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening costs, property charges and other, share-based payments, and other non-operating income/ (expense). Adjusted EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because our Directors believe that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Our Adjusted EBITDA presented herein also differs from the Adjusted EBITDA presented by Wynn Resorts, Limited for its Macau segment in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States, primarily due to the inclusion of royalty fees, adjustments for IFRS differences with U.S. GAAP, corporate support and other support services in arriving at operating profit.
The following table sets forth a quantitative reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable IFRS measurement, operating profit, for the years ended 31 December 2010 and 2009.
Note:
Pre-opening costs for the years 2010 and 2009 primarily consisted of payroll attributable to staff engaged in the start-up operations of Encore which opened on 21 April 2010.

Notes:
Total casino revenues do not equal the sum of "VIP gross table games win," "mass market gross table games win" and "slot machine win" because gross table games win is calculated before commissions and discounts, and only recorded as revenues after the relevant commissions and discounts have been deducted.

For purposes of this table, we calculate average number of gaming tables and average number of slots as the average numbers of gaming tables and slot machines in service on each day in the year.
Daily gross win per gaming table and daily win per slot are presented in this table on the basis of the average number of gaming tables and average number of slots, respectively, over the number of days Wynn Macau and Encore were open in the applicable year. In addition, the total table games win figures used herein do not correspond to casino revenues figures in our financial statements, because figures in our financial statements are calculated net of commissions and discounts and the total table games win herein is calculated before commissions and discounts.
Discussion of Results of Operations
Financial results for the year ended 31 December 2010 compared to financial results for the year ended 31 December 2009
Operating Revenues
Total operating revenues increased by 59.4% from HK$14.1 billion in 2009 to HK$22.4 billion in 2010. We believe this increase was due to a combination of factors, including the opening of Encore, increased visitation and an overall increase in gaming volumes in Macau during 2010.
 
16 Wynn Macau, Limited
Management Discussion and Analysis
Casino Revenues
Casino revenues increased by 59.7%, from HK$13.2 billion (93.7% of total operating revenues) in 2009 to HK$21.1 billion (93.8% of total operating revenues) in 2010. The components and reasons are as follows:
VIP casino gaming operations. VIP gross table games win increased by 74.5%, from HK$12.2 billion in 2009 to HK$21.3 billion in 2010. VIP table games turnover increased by 68.4%, from HK$421.0 billion in 2009 to HK$709.1 billion 2010. VIP gross table games win as a percentage of turnover (calculated before discounts and commissions) increased from 2.9% in 2009 to 3.0% in 2010 (win percentages are within the expected range of 2.7% to 3.0%). In November 2009, we added two new private gaming salons with 29 VIP tables and on 21 April 2010, we added 37 VIP tables with the opening of Encore which helped drive some of the growth in our VIP segment in 2010 compared to the prior year.
Mass market casino gaming operations. Mass market gross table games win increased by 26.9%, from HK$3.4 billion in 2009 to HK$4.3 billion in 2010. Mass market table games drop increased by 17.7%, from HK$15.5 billion in 2009 to HK$18.2 billion in 2010. The mass market gross table games win percentage (calculated before discounts) was 21.9% in 2009 compared to 23.6% in 2010, which was above the expected win percentage range of 19% to 21%.
Slot machine gaming operations. Slot machine win increased by 30.1% from HK$1.3 billion in 2009 to HK$1.7 billion in 2010. Slot machine handle increased by 24.1%, from HK$26.3 billion in 2009 to HK$32.7 billion in 2010. The increases resulted primarily from the play of high-end slot customers. Consequently, total gross slot win increased and slot machine win per unit per day increased by 33.2% from HK$2,991 in 2009 to HK$3,985 in 2010.
Non-casino Revenues
Net non-casino revenues, which include room, food and beverage and retail revenues, increased by 55.0%, from HK$891.3 million (6.3% of total operating revenues) in 2009 to HK$1,381.2 million (6.2% of total operating revenues) in 2010. The increase in revenues was largely due to stronger retail sales in 2010 and the opening of Encore.
Room. Our room revenues, which exclude promotional allowances in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income, increased by 39.9% from HK$102.8 million in 2009 to HK$143.8 million in 2010. The increase reflects higher business volumes as the opening of Encore increased room inventory available for sale to customers.
 
Annual Report 2010 17
Management Discussion and Analysis
Management also evaluates room revenues on an adjusted basis which include promotional allowances. Adjusted room revenues including promotional allowances increased by 63.4% from HK$437.0 million in 2009 to HK$713.8 million in 2010.
The following table presents additional information about our adjusted room revenues (which include promotional allowances):
Food and beverage. Food and beverage revenues, which exclude promotional allowances in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income, totaled HK$165.9 million in 2010, a 24.3% increase from 2009 revenues of HK$133.4 million. The increase reflects higher business volumes and the opening of Encore.
Management also evaluates food and beverage revenues on an adjusted basis including promotional allowances. Food and beverage revenues in 2010 adjusted to include these promotional allowances were HK$550.5 million, a 40.4% increase from 2009 adjusted revenues of HK$392.1 million reflecting the increase in business volumes and the opening of Encore.
Retail and other. Our retail and other revenues, which exclude promotional allowances in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income, increased by 63.6%, from HK$655.1 million in 2009 to HK$1,071.6 million in 2010. The increase was due primarily to increased sales at several retail outlets, the opening in November 2009 of Wynn and Co. Watches and Jewelry, which sells Cartier and Jaeger Le Coultre products and new outlets at Encore at Wynn Macau including Chanel, Piaget and Cartier at Encore.
 
18 Wynn Macau, Limited
Management Discussion and Analysis
Management also evaluates retail and other revenues on an adjusted basis which includes promotional allowances. Adjusted retail and other revenues including promotional allowances increased by 64.9% from HK$663.4 million in 2009 to HK$1,093.9 million in 2010, reflecting the increased sales at several retail outlets and the opening of Wynn and Co. Watches and Jewelry, which sells Cartier and Jaeger Le Coultre products at Wynn Macau, and Chanel, Piaget and Cartier at Encore.
Operating Costs and Expenses
Gaming taxes and premiums. Gaming taxes and premiums increased by 60.4%, from HK$6.7 billion in 2009 to HK$10.8 billion in 2010. This increase was due to increased gross gaming win in 2010 compared to 2009. Wynn Macau is subject to a 35% gaming tax on gross gaming win. In addition, Wynn Macau is also required to pay 4% of its gross gaming win as contributions for public development and social facilities.
Staff costs. Staff costs increased by 14.3%, from HK$1.6 billion in 2009 to HK$1.8 billion in 2010. The increase was primarily due to the hiring of additional staff for Encore.
Other operating expenses. Other operating expenses increased by 57.6%, from HK$2.6 billion in 2009 to HK$4.1 billion in 2010. The increase in other operating costs was primarily due to increased business volume related expenses such as gaming promoter's commissions, cost of sales and royalty fees.
Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased by 37.8% from HK$718.2 million in 2009 to HK$989.5 million in 2010. This increase was primarily due to the impact of assets placed in service with the opening of Encore in April 2010 and the expansion that opened in November 2009.
Property charges and other. Property charges and other increased by 144.7%, from HK$19.2 million in 2009 to HK$47.0 million in 2010. The charges in each year represent gain/loss on the sale of equipment as well as costs related to assets retired or abandoned as a result of renovating certain assets of Wynn Macau in response to customer preferences and changes in market demand.
As a result of the foregoing, total operating costs and expenses increased by 52.1%, from HK$11.7 billion in 2009 to HK$17.7 billion in 2010.
 
Annual Report 2010 19
Management Discussion and Analysis
Finance Revenues
Finance revenues decreased by 64.6%, from HK$5.7 million in 2009 to HK$2.0 million in 2010, reflecting a significant decrease in the average invested cash balances compared to the prior year.
Finance Costs
Finance costs decreased by 19.5%, from HK$317.4 million in 2009 to HK$255.5 million in 2010. Finance costs decreased in 2010 primarily due to the reduction in amounts outstanding under the revolver component of the Wynn Macau Credit Facility and lower interest rates in 2010 compared to 2009.
Interest Rate Swaps
As required under the terms of our various credit facilities, we have entered into agreements which swap a portion of the interest on our loans from floating to fixed rates. These transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as an increase or decrease in swap fair value during each year. We recorded a credit of HK$26.5 million for 2010 resulting from the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps in 2010. We recorded an expense of HK$29.5 million in 2009 resulting from the decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swaps in 2009.
Income Tax Expense
In 2010, our income tax expense was HK$44.1 million compared to an income tax expense of HK$5.6 million in 2009. Our current income tax expense for 2010 primarily relates to income tax expense recorded by WRM to increase tax reserves for possible unfavorable tax outcomes and income tax expense of our subsidiaries owning WRM's shares under the WRM Shareholder Dividend Tax Agreement. Our 2010 deferred income tax provision primarily results from WRM derecognizing certain deferred tax assets no longer believed realizable. During 2009, our income tax expense mainly related to the amount accrued for the years 2006 through 2009 for the WRM Shareholder Dividend Tax Agreement and a deferred tax benefit recorded by WRM resulting from a decrease in its deferred tax liability for property and equipment.
Net Profit Attributable to Owners of the Company
As a result of the foregoing, net profit attributable to owners of the Company increased by 113.8%, from HK$2.1 billion in 2009 to HK$4.4 billion in 2010.

Wynn Macau Credit Facilities
Overview
As at 31 December 2010, WRM's credit facilities consisted of HK$12.0 billion in a combination of Hong Kong dollar and U.S. dollar facilities, including a HK$4.3 billion fully funded senior term loan facility and a HK$7.7 billion senior revolving credit facility. The facilities may be used for a variety of purposes, including further enhancements at our resort, investments in other projects in Macau and general corporate purposes.
We have the ability to increase secured debt under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities by up to an additional US$50 million (approximately HK$389.3 million).
As at 31 December 2010, we had total bank and other borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities of HK$5.1 billion, of which HK$1.4 billion was denominated in U.S. dollars and HK$3.7 billion was denominated in Hong Kong dollars.
In July 2009, as part of the Group Reorganization, WRM requested and obtained from its syndicate lenders under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities certain consents necessary to permit the Group Reorganization. As a result, WM Cayman Holdings Limited II became the highest level obligor, guarantor and chargor under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities and Wynn Group Asia, Inc. ceased to be an obligor, guarantor or chargor under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.
The Company is not a party to the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities and has no rights or obligations thereunder.
Principal and Interest
The term loans under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities mature in June 2014, and the revolving loans under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities mature in June 2012. The principal amount of the term loans is required to be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing in September 2011. Borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities bear interest at LIBOR or HIBOR plus a margin of 1.75%, through 30 September 2010. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2010, the revolving loans, the hotel facility of the term loan and tranches A and B of the project facility of the term loan are subject to a margin of 1.25% to 2.00% depending on the Group's leverage ratio at the end of each quarter. Tranche C of the project facility of the term loan remains subject to a margin of 1.75%. As at 31 December 2010, the weighted average margin is 1.29%.

Management Discussion and Analysis
Security and Guarantees
Collateral for the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities consists of substantially all of the assets of WRM. Certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries have executed guarantees and pledged their interests in WRM in support of the obligations under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities. With respect to the Concession Agreement, the WRM lenders do have certain cure rights and consultation rights with the Macau government upon an enforcement by the lenders.
Second Ranking Lender
WRM is also party to a bank guarantee reimbursement agreement with Banco National Ultramarino S.A. to secure a guarantee in favor of the Macau government as required under the Concession Agreement. The amount of this guarantee is MOP300 million (approximately HK$291.3 million) and it lasts until 180 days after the end of the term of the Concession Agreement. The guarantee assures WRM's performance under the Concession Agreement, including the payment of certain premiums, fines and indemnities for breach. The guarantee is secured by a second priority security interest in the same collateral package securing the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and conditions, such as inflation, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates.
Foreign Exchange Risks
The financial statements of foreign operations are translated into Hong Kong dollars, the Group's presentation currency, for incorporation into the consolidated financial information. Assets and liabilities are translated at the prevailing foreign exchange rates in effect at the end of the reporting period. Income, expenditures and cash flow items are measured at the actual foreign exchange rates or average foreign exchange rates for the period. The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years. However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca to the U.S. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to, among other things, changes in governmental policies and international economic and political developments.
Interest Rate Risks
One of our primary exposures to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our credit facilities, which bear interest based on floating rates. We attempt to manage interest rate risk by managing the mix of long-term fixed rate borrowings and variable rate borrowings supplemented by hedging activities as considered necessary. We cannot assure you that these risk management strategies will have the desired effect, and interest rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
 
Annual Report 2010 27
Management Discussion and Analysis
As at 31 December 2010, the Group had three interest rate swaps intended to manage a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities. Under the first swap agreement, the Group pays a fixed interest rate of 3.632% on U.S. dollar borrowings of approximately US$153.8 million (approximately HK$1.2 billion) incurred under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities in exchange for receipts on the same amount at a variable interest rate based on the applicable LIBOR at the time of payment. Under the second swap agreement, the Group pays a fixed interest rate of 3.39% on Hong Kong dollar borrowings of approximately HK$991.6 million incurred under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities in exchange for receipts on the same amount at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. Based on the applicable margin of the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, as at 31 December 2010, these interest rate swaps fix the interest rates on the U.S. dollar and the Hong Kong dollar borrowings at approximately 4.882% to 5.382% and 4.64%, respectively. Both agreements will terminate in August 2011.
The Group entered into the third interest rate swap agreement on 17 August 2009, with an effective date of 27 November 2009, to manage a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities. Under this swap agreement, beginning 27 November 2009, the Group pays a fi xed interest rate of 2.15% on borrowings of approximately HK$2.3 billion incurred under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities in exchange for receipts on the same amount at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. As at 31 December 2010, this interest rate swap fixes the interest rate on HK$2.3 billion of borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities at approximately 3.4%. This interest rate swap agreement will terminate in June 2012.
The carrying values of these interest rate swaps on the consolidated statement of financial position approximates their fair values. The fair value approximates the amount the Group would pay if these contracts were settled at the respective valuation dates. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions and, therefore, is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods. We adjust this amount by applying a non-performance valuation, considering our creditworthiness or the creditworthiness of our counterparties at each settlement date, as applicable. These transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting. Accordingly, changes in the fair values during the years ended 31 December 2010 and 2009, were charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Our liabilities under the swap agreements are secured by the same collateral package securing the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.

Management Discussion and Analysis
OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor do we engage in any transactions involving derivatives except for interest rate swaps. We do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity.
OTHER LIQUIDITY MATTERS
We expect that Wynn Macau and Encore will fund their operations and capital expenditure requirements from operating cash flows, cash on hand and availability under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities. However, we cannot be sure that operating cash flows will be sufficient for those purposes. We may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot be sure that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all.
New business developments (including our development of a project in Cotai) or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. There can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity. Any other development would require us to obtain additional financing.
In the ordinary course of business, in response to market demands and client preferences, and in order to increase revenues, we have made and will continue to make enhancements and refinements to Wynn Macau and Encore. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital expenditures related to these enhancements and refinements.
Taking into consideration our financial resources, including our cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and availability under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, we believe that we have sufficient liquid assets to meet our working capital and operating requirements for the following 12 months.

SHARE OPTION SCHEME
The Company approved the adoption of a share option scheme on 16 September 2009 with the implementation of the scheme conditional on the Company's listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

The options granted under the scheme do not give immediate ownership of the underlying Shares as they require payment of a subscription price which is based on the then prevailing market price of the Shares.
During the year ended 31 December 2010, a total of 1 million Shares were granted (2009: nil). A summary of the terms of the share option scheme is set out below:
Number of Shares Available for Issue under the Scheme

Maximum Entitlement of Participant
The maximum number of Shares issued and to be issued upon exercise of the share options granted to each participant under the share option scheme (including both exercised and outstanding share options) in any 12-month period shall not (when aggregated with any Shares subject to share options granted during such period under any other share option schemes of the Company other than those share options granted pursuant to specific approval by the Shareholders in a general meeting) exceed one percent of the Shares in issue for the time being.
Where any further grant of share options to a participant would result in the Shares issued and to be issued upon exercise of all share options granted and to be granted to such person (including exercised, cancelled and outstanding share options) in the 12-month period up to and including the date of such further grant representing in aggregate over one percent of the Shares in issue, such further grant must be separately approved by Shareholders in general meeting with such participant and his associates abstaining from voting.

Corporate Governance Report
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES
The Company is dedicated to maintaining and ensuring high standards of corporate governance practices and the corporate governance principles of the Company are adopted in the best interest of the Company and its Shareholders. The Company's corporate governance practices are based on the principles, code provisions and certain recommended best practices as set out in the Code on Corporate Governance Practices contained in Appendix 14 to the Listing Rules.
The Company has complied with the code provisions in the Code on Corporate Governance Practices for the year ended 31 December 2010, except for the following deviation from provision A.2.1 of the Code on Corporate Governance Practices.
The Board notes that on 24 February 2011, Dr. Allan Zeman disposed of 10,000 shares in the common stock of Wynn Resorts, Limited on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation Global Select Market at US$120 per share. The relevant notice to the Company and the Securities and Futures Commission, which is available to the public, disclosing this event was filed on 28 February 2011.
Stephen A. Wynn as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Under code provision A.2.1 of the Code, the roles of chairman and chief executive officer should be separate and should not be performed by the same individual. The Company does not at present separate the roles of the chairman and chief executive officer.
Mr. Wynn, the founder of the Company and Wynn Macau, serves as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The Board has determined that the combination of these roles held singularly by Mr. Wynn is in the best interest of the Company and all Shareholders. The Board believes that the issue of whether to combine or separate the offices of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer is part of the succession planning process and that it is in the best interests of the Company for the Board to make a determination whether to combine or separate the roles based upon the circumstances. The Board has given careful consideration to separating the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and has determined that the Company and its Shareholders are best served by the current structure. Mr. Wynn's combined role promotes unified leadership and direction for the Board and executive management and allows for a single, clear focus for the Company's operational and strategic efforts.
 
Annual Report 2010 57
Corporate Governance Report
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES (continued)
Stephen A. Wynn as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (continued)
The combined role of Mr. Wynn as both Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is balanced by the Company's governance structure, policies and controls. All major decisions are made in consultation with members of the Board and the relevant Board committees. The Company has three Board committees, namely the audit committee, remuneration committee, and nomination and corporate governance committee. Each Board committee comprises non-executive Directors only and is chaired by an independent non-executive Director. In addition, there are three independent nonexecutive Directors on the Board offering independent perspectives.
This structure encourages independent and effective oversight of the Company's operations and prudent management of risk.
For the reasons stated above and as a result of the structure, policies and procedures outlined above, and in light of the historical success of Mr. Wynn's leadership, the Board has concluded that the current Board leadership structure is in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders.
MODEL CODE FOR SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS BY DIRECTORS
The Company adopted the Model Code on 16 September 2009 as its code of conduct for securities transactions by Directors. On 23 March 2010, the Company adopted its own code of conduct for securities transactions, the terms of such code being no less exacting than those set out in the Model Code. Having made specific enquiry of the Directors, all Directors have confirmed that they have complied with the required standard of dealings and code of conduct regarding securities dealings by directors as set out in the Model Code and the Company's own code of conduct for the year ended 31 December 2010.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

CORPORATE INFORMATION
The Company was incorporated in the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability on 4 September 2009. The Company's Shares were listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 9 October 2009. The Company's registered office address is P.O. Box 309, Ugland House, Grand Cayman, KY1-1104, Cayman Islands, or at such other place as the Directors may from time to time decide.
The Group owns and operates a hotel and casino resort, Wynn Macau, which conducts gaming activities in casinos in Macau under a concession contract signed with the Macau Government on 24 June 2002. The 20-year concession period commenced on 27 June 2002 and will expire on 26 June 2022.
On 21 April 2010, the Group opened Encore at Wynn Macau, a second hotel tower and casino with additional related amenities that are integrated with the current facilities at Wynn Macau.
Pursuant to the Group Reorganization which was undertaken for the purpose of the Listing of the Company's Shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Company acquired WM
Cayman Holdings Limited II, which was at the relevant time the holding company of the subsidiaries comprising the Group, from the Company's immediate parent company, WM
Cayman Holdings Limited I. The consideration for the acquisition consisted of (a) the issue by the Company to WM Cayman Holdings Limited I of an acquisition note; and (b) the issue by the Company to WM Cayman Holdings Limited I of such number of new Shares as would amount to approximately 75% of the Company's issued share capital (as calculated based on the Company's issued share capital following its initial public offering and assuming no exercise of the over-allotment option). The acquisition was completed on 8 October 2009 with the relevant Shares and acquisition note being issued by the Company to WM Cayman Holdings Limited I. The acquisition note was redeemed by the Company on 9 October 2009 for a sum of HK$12.6 billion. Since the completion of the Group Reorganization on 8 October 2009, the Company has been the holding company of the subsidiaries now comprising the Group. The details of the Group Reorganization are set out in the section headed "Reorganization" in Appendix VI "Statutory and General Information" to the IPO Prospectus of the Company dated 24 September 2009, filed in connection with the Listing.
WM Cayman Holdings Limited I owns approximately 72.29% of the Company and approximately 27.71% of the Company is owned by public shareholders. The ultimate parent company of Wynn Macau, Limited is Wynn Resorts, Limited, a publicly-traded company incorporated in the United States of America.

BASIS OF PREPARATION
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards which comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board (the "IASB"), International Accounting Standards and Standing Interpretation Committee interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Committee and the disclosure requirements of the Companies Ordinance. The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of derivative financial instruments which have been measured at fair value. These financial statements are presented in Hong Kong dollar(s) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (HK$'000), except when otherwise indicated.
In the prior year, the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the principles of merger accounting as a result of the Group Reorganization. On this basis, the Company has been treated as the holding company of its subsidiaries for the financial years presented rather than from the date of their acquisition. Accordingly, the results of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2009 include the results of the Company and its subsidiaries with effect from 1 January 2009. All income, expenses and unrealised gains and losses resulting from intercompany transactions and intercompany balances within the Group are eliminated on consolidation in full.
In the opinion of the Directors, the consolidated financial statements prepared on the above basis presented more fairly the results and state of affairs of the Group as a whole.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 have been reclassified to be consistent with the current year presentation. These reclassifications have no effect on the previously reported profit for the prior year.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an entity whose financial and operating policies the Company controls, directly or indirectly, so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
 
Annual Report 2010 75
Financial Statements
Notes to Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2010
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Subsidiaries (continued)
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between group companies and dividends are eliminated on consolidation in full. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
In the Company's statement of financial position, the investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment losses. The results of subsidiaries are accounted for by the Company on the basis of dividend received and receivable.
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount recognized for non-controlling interests and any fair value of the Group's previously held equity interests in the acquiree over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the sum of this consideration and other items is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is, after reassessment, recognized in the statement of comprehensive income as a gain on bargain purchase.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position as an asset, initially measured at cost and subsequently at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. The Group performs its annual impairment test of goodwill as at 31 December. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the Group are assigned to those units or groups of units.
 
76 Wynn Macau, Limited

Notes to Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2010
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Goodwill (continued)
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (group of cash-generating units) to which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (group of cash-generating units) is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit (group of cash-generating units) and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Foreign currency translation
These financial statements are presented in Hong Kong dollars, which is the Company's functional and presentation currency. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group's entities at their respective functional currency rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rates of exchange ruling at the statement of financial position date. All differences are taken to the statement of comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined.

Related parties
A party is considered to be related to the Group if:
the party directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, (i) controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the Group; (ii) has an interest in the Group that gives it significant influence over the Group; or (iii) has joint control over the Group;
the party is a jointly-controlled entity or an associate;
the party is a member of the key management personnel of the Group or its parent;
the party is a close member of the family of any individual referred to in (a) or (c);
the party is an entity that is controlled, jointly controlled or significantly influenced by or for which significant voting power in such entity resides with, directly or indirectly, any individual referred to in (c) or (d); or
the party is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of the employees of the Group, or of any entity that is a related party of the Group.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The cost of an item of property and equipment comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use. Expenditure incurred after items of property and equipment have been put into operation, such as repairs and maintenance costs, are recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they are incurred. When significant parts of property and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group recognises such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciation, respectively. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. The present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of the asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met.

Property and equipment (continued)
Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis to write off the cost of each item of property and equipment to its residual value over the shorter of the remaining term of the gaming concession (for designated gaming assets and space) or land concession (for all other assets), as applicable, or their estimated useful lives. The gaming concession and land concession currently expire in June 2022 and August 2029, respectively. The estimated useful lives used for this purpose are as follows:
Building and improvements 10 to 25 years
Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 to 20 years
Leasehold improvements (shorter of remaining lease period 1 to 5 years
or estimated useful life)
An item of property and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of comprehensive income when the asset is derecognized.
The asset's residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
Construction in progress represents assets under development or construction, which are stated at cost less any impairment losses, and are not depreciated. Cost comprises the direct costs of construction and capitalized borrowing costs on related borrowed funds during the period of construction. Construction in progress is reclassified to the appropriate category of property and equipment when completed and ready for use.
Leasehold interest in land
Leasehold interest in land under an operating lease is payments made on entering into or acquiring a land-use right over an extended period of time. The total lease payments are amortized on the straight-line basis over the lease terms in accordance with the expected pattern of consumption of the economic benefits embodied in the land-use right.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalized as part of the cost of the respective assets. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset's recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or a cash-generating unit's (CGU) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined by individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using pre-tax discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs to sell, recent market transactions are taken into account, if available. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.
These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded subsidiaries or other available fair value indicators.
The Group bases its impairment calculations on detailed budgets and forecast calculations which are prepared separately for each of the Group's CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.
Impairment losses of continuing operations including impairments on inventories, are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired assets.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Impairment of non-financial assets (continued)
For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the Group estimates the asset's or CGU's recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.
Investments and other financial assets
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. When financial assets are recognized initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets on initial recognition and, where allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each financial year end.
All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the trade date, which is the date that the Group commits to purchase the asset. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the period generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. After initial measurement, loans and receivables (including trade and other receivables, deposits, amounts due from related companies and cash and cash equivalents) are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less impairment. Gains and losses are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income when the loans and receivables are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each statement of financial position date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
Assets carried at amortized cost
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on assets carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the estimated impairment loss decreases because of an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss is increased or reduced by adjusting the allowance account. If a future write-off is later recovered, the recovery is credited to finance costs in the statement of comprehensive income.
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the transaction. The carrying amount of the receivables is reduced through the use of an allowance account. Impaired debts are derecognized when they are assessed as uncollectible.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out, average or specific identification methods. Net realizable value is based on estimated selling prices less estimated costs to be incurred on completion and disposal.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short term investments in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and on hand and short term investments with an original maturity of three months or less. For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above.

Financial liabilities
The Group's and the Company's financial liabilities are generally classified as other financial liabilities, which include accounts payable, other payables, amounts due to related companies, interest-bearing loans and borrowings, construction retention payables and other long-term liabilities, and are subsequently measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognized at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs, and have not been designated as "at fair value through profit or loss".
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.
Gains and losses are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the effective interest rate method (EIR) amortization process.
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance costs in the statement of comprehensive income.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, are initially recognized at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income immediately unless the derivative is designated as an effective hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income depends on the nature of the hedging relationship.
Current versus non-current classification
Derivative instruments that are not designated as effective hedging instruments are classified as current or non-current, or are separated into a current or a non-current portion, based on an assessment of the facts and circumstances (i.e. the underlying contracted cash flows).

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognized when:
 -  the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay cash flow receipts in full without material delay to a third party under a "pass-through" arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognized to the extent of the Group's continuing involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.
When continuing involvement takes the form of a written and/or purchased option (including a cash settled option or similar provision) on the transferred asset, the extent of the Group's continuing involvement is the amount of the transferred asset that the Group may repurchase, except that in the case of a written put option (including a cash settled option or similar provision) on an asset measured at fair value, the extent of the Group's continuing involvement is limited to the lower of the fair value of the transferred asset and the option exercise price.
Financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled, or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a finance cost.
Pensions and other post employment benefits
The Group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme (the "Scheme"). The Scheme allows eligible employees to contribute 5% of their salary to the Scheme and the Group matches the contributions with an equal amount. The assets of the Scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund. The Group's matching contributions vest to the employee at 10% per year with full vesting in ten years. Forfeitures of unvested contributions are used to reduce the Group's liability for its contributions payable under the Scheme. The contributions are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the Scheme.
Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including senior executives and directors) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments in the form of common shares of the ultimate parent company, Wynn Resorts, Limited, or beginning in September 2009, Wynn Macau, Limited.
In situations where equity instruments are issued and some or all of the goods or services received by the entity as consideration cannot be specifically identified, they are measured as the difference between the fair value of the share-based payment transaction and the fair value of any identifiable goods or services received at the grant date. This is then capitalized or expensed as appropriate.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Share-based payment transactions (continued)
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees, for awards granted after 7 November 2002, is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. The fair value is determined by using an appropriate pricing model, further details of which are given in note 22.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognized, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (the "vesting date"). The cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The charge or credit to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognized as of the beginning and end of that period and is recognized in staff costs.
No expense is recognized for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for equity-settled transactions where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognized is the expense as if the terms had not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met.
An additional expense is recognized for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transactions, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognized for the award is recognized immediately.
This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of either the entity or the employee are not met. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph. All cancellations of equity-settled transaction awards are treated equally.

Equity-settled transactions (continued)
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at its inception and whether the fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
Group as a lessee
Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognized as an operating expense in the statement of comprehensive income on the straight-line basis over the lease term.
Group as a lessor
When an asset is leased out under an operating lease, the asset is included in the statement of financial position based on the nature of the asset. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognized as revenue in the period in which they are earned.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duties.
Casino revenues are measured by the aggregate net difference between gaming wins and losses, with liabilities recognized for funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs and for chips in customers' possession. Revenues are recognized net of certain sales incentives.
Accordingly, the Group's casino revenues are reduced by discounts, commissions and points earned in customer loyalty programs.

Taxes
Current income tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amounts expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.
Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the statement of financial position date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except:
where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized, except:
where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and

in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each statement of financial position date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each statement of financial position date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date. Deferred income tax items are recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Gaming taxes and premiums
According to the gaming concession granted by the Macau government and the relevant legislation, the Group is required to pay a 35% gaming tax on gross gaming win. The Group is also required to pay an additional 4% of gross gaming win as public development and social related contributions. The Group also makes certain variable and fixed payments to the Macau government based on the number of slot machines and table games in its operation on monthly and yearly bases, respectively. These expenses are reported as "gaming taxes and premiums" in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to manage risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. The Group adjusts this amount by applying a non- performance valuation after considering the Group's creditworthiness or the creditworthiness of the Group's counterparties at each settlement date. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. All gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives are taken directly to the statement of comprehensive income as none of the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
A diamond and fine art
The Group's diamond and fine art are stated at cost less accumulated impairment. The amount represents the aggregate cost of the diamond and artwork. The diamond and artwork impairment is assessed based on the cash-generating unit to which it belongs, which is usually the property in its entirety. No impairment charge has been taken for the diamond or artwork for the years ended 31 December 2010 and 2009.
Dividends
Final dividends proposed by the directors are classified as a separate allocation of retained earnings within the equity section of the statement of financial position, until they have been approved by the shareholders in a general meeting. When these dividends have been approved by the shareholders and declared, they are recognized as a liability.
Interim/special dividends are simultaneously proposed and declared because the Company's memorandum and articles of association grant the Directors the authority to declare interim/ special dividends. Consequently, interim/special dividends are recognized immediately as a liability when they are proposed and declared.
Statutory reserve
In accordance with the provisions of the Macau Commercial Code, Wynn Macau, Limited's subsidiaries incorporated in Macau are required to transfer a minimum of 10% of their annual net profit to a legal reserve until that reserve equals 25% of their initial capital. This reserve is not distributable to the shareholders.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of the Group's financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the reporting date. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in the future. Key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments in applying the Group's accounting policies which have a significant effect on the financial statements are set out below.
Useful lives of property and equipment
The useful lives of assets are based on management's estimation. Management considers the impact of changes in technology, customer service requirements, availability of capital funding and required return on assets and equity to determine the optimum useful life expectation for each of the individual categories of property, plant, and equipment. The estimation of residual values of assets is also based on management's judgment whether the assets will be sold or used to the end of their useful lives and what their condition will be like at that time. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis to write off the cost of each item of property and equipment to its residual value over the shorter of the remaining term of the gaming concession (for designated gaming assets and space) or land concession (for all other assets), as applicable, or their estimated useful lives. Management's periodic reviews on the estimations made could result in changes in depreciable lives and therefore depreciation expense in future periods.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES (continued)
Impairment of non-financial assets
Management is required to make judgments concerning the cause, timing and amount of impairments. In the identification of impairment indicators, management considers the impact of changes in current competitive conditions, cost of capital, availability of funding, technological obsolescence, discontinuance of services and other circumstances that could indicate that an impairment exists. The Group applies the impairment assessment to its separate CGUs. This requires management to make significant judgments concerning the existence of impairment indicators, identification of separate CGU's remaining useful lives of assets and estimates of projected cash flows and fair value less costs to sell. For non-financial assets other than goodwill, management judgment is also required when assessing whether a previously recognized impairment loss should be reversed. Where impairment indicators exist, the determination of the recoverable amount of a CGU requires management to make assumptions to determine the fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In addition, for goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated annually whether or not there is any indication of impairment.
Key assumptions on which management has based its determination of fair value less costs to sell include the existence of binding sale agreements, and for the determination of value in use include projected revenues, gross margins, and average revenue per asset component, capital expenditure, expected customer bases and market share. Management is also required to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
Changes in key assumptions on which the recoverable amount of the assets is based could significantly affect the Group's financial condition and results of operations.
Impairment of accounts receivable
Management evaluates the reserve for bad debts based on a specific review of customer accounts as well as experience with collection trends in the casino industry and current economic and business conditions. As customer payment experience evolves, management will continue to refine the estimated reserve for bad debts. Accordingly, the associated provision for doubtful accounts charge may fluctuate. Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region's economy or legal systems occur.

Segment reporting
The Group currently operates in one business segment, namely, the management of its casino, hotel, retail and food and beverage operations. A single management team reports to the chief operating decision-makers who comprehensively manage the entire business. Accordingly, the Group does not have separate reportable segments.
Fair value estimation  financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are recognized or disclosed at fair values. The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices. In assessing the fair value of non-traded instruments, discounted cash flows or market assessments are used.
The nominal values less any estimated credit realizable value adjustments for financial assets and liabilities with a maturity of less than one year, including prepayments, other payables or current borrowings, are assumed to approximate their fair values. Management determines these assumptions by reviewing current market rates, making industry comparisons and reviewing conditions relevant to the Group.
Fair value estimation  Black-Scholes valuation model
The Group uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to value the ultimate parent company's and Wynn Macau, Limited's grants of options issued. The Black-Scholes valuation model uses assumptions of expected volatility, risk-free interest rates, the expected terms of options granted, and expected rates of dividends. Changes in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value. Expected volatility is based on implied and historical factors related to Wynn Resorts' and Wynn Macau, Limited's common stock. Expected term represents the weighted average time between the option's grant date and its exercise date. The risk-free interest rate used is equal to the U.S. Treasury yield curve and Hong Kong Exchange Fund Bills for the WRL Stock Plan and Wynn Macau, Limited's Share Option Scheme, respectively, at the time of grant for the period equal to the expected term.
Income taxes
Income taxes represent the sum of income taxes currently payable and any deferred taxes. The calculation of deferred income taxes and any associated allowance is subject to a significant amount of judgment. The Group's income tax reports may be examined by governmental authorities. Accordingly, the Group reviews any potentially unfavorable tax outcome and, when an unfavorable outcome is identified as probable and can be reasonably estimated, an allowance is established.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS
As at 31 December 2010, the Group had three interest rate swap agreements. Under the first swap agreement, the Group pays a fixed interest rate of 3.632% on U.S. dollar borrowings of approximately US$153.8 million (approximately HK$1.2 billion) incurred under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities in exchange for receipts on the same amount at a variable interest rate based on the applicable LIBOR at the time of payment. Under the second swap agreement, the Group pays a fixed interest rate of 3.39% on Hong Kong dollar borrowings of approximately HK$991.6 million incurred under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities in exchange for receipts on the same amount at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. Based on the applicable margin of the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, as at 31 December 2010, these interest rate swaps fix the interest rates on the U.S. dollar and the Hong Kong dollar borrowings at approximately 4.882% to 5.382% (2009: 5.382%) and 4.64% (2009: 5.14%), respectively. Both agreements will terminate in August 2011.

For the year ended 31 December 2010
INTEREST RATE SWAPS (continued)
Under the third swap agreement, the Group pays a fixed interest rate of 2.15% on borrowings of approximately HK$2.3 billion incurred under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities in exchange for receipts on the same amount at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. As at 31 December 2010, this interest rate swap fixes the interest rate on HK$2.3 billion of borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities at approximately 3.4% (2009: 3.9%). This interest rate swap agreement will terminate in June 2012.
The carrying value of these interest rate swaps in the consolidated statement of financial position approximates their fair value. The fair value approximates the amount the Group would pay if these contracts were settled at the respective valuation dates. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions and, therefore, is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods. The Group adjusts this amount by applying a non-performance valuation, considering its creditworthiness or the creditworthiness of its counterparties at each settlement date, as applicable. These transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting. Accordingly, changes in the fair values during the years ended 31 December 2010 and 2009, were charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The Group's liabilities under the swap agreements are secured by the same collateral package securing the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.

102 Wynn Macau, Limited Financial Statements Notes to Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2010 5. INCOME TAX EXPENSE (continued) The Group incurred Macau tax losses of approximately HK$692.5 million, HK$502.1 million and HK$966.2 million during the tax years ended 31 December 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. These tax losses will expire in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. As at 31 December 2010, the Group's deferred tax assets relating to pre-opening expenses, interest rate swaps, executive compensation, fixed assets and tax loss carryforwards amounting to HK$276.2 million were not recognized as the Group determined it was not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deferred tax asset could be utilized. As at 31 December 2009, the Group had not recognized deferred tax assets relating to pre-opening expenses and tax loss carryforwards amounting to HK$247.6 million for similar reasons. Effective 6 September 2006, WRM received a 5-year exemption from Macau's 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits ("Tax Holiday"). Accordingly, the Group was exempted from the payment of approximately HK$499.2 million in such tax for the year ended 31 December 2010 (2009: HK$242.6 million). The Group's non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and its casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming Tax and other levies in accordance with its Concession Agreement. On 21 October 2010, WRM applied for an additional 5-year exemption from Macau's 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Such application was approved and granted on 30 November 2010 for a 5-year period effective 1 January 2011 through 31 December 2015. During June 2009, WRM entered into an agreement, effective retroactively to 2006, with the Macau Special Administrative Region that provides for an annual payment of MOP7.2 million (approximately HK$7.0 million) to the Macau Special Administrative Region in lieu of Complementary Tax on dividend distributions to its shareholders from gaming profits. The term of this agreement is five years, which coincides with the Tax Holiday which began in 2006. The agreement explicitly states that MOP21.6 million (approximately HK$21.0 million) was due upon execution of the agreement for the period from 2006 to 2008, and the remaining payments are due by 31 January of the year following which the gaming profits are exempt from Complementary Tax. In November 2009, the Group made a payment of MOP21.6 million (approximately HK$21.0 million) for the period from 2006 to 2008, and in January 2010 the Group made a payment of MOP7.2 million (approximately HK$7.0 million) for the year ended 31 December 2009. The Group has accrued MOP7.2 million (approximately HK$7.0 million) for the year ended 31 December 2010 which was subsequently settled on 17 January 2011. On 3 November 2010, WRM applied for an extension of this agreement for an additional five years through 31 December 2015. As at 31 December 2010 and as at the date of approval of these financial statements, such application was still being processed by the Macau Special Administrative Region.
 
Annual Report 2010 103 Financial Statements Notes to Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2010 5. INCOME TAX EXPENSE (continued) The Group is exempted from income tax in the Isle of Man and the Cayman Islands. The Group's subsidiaries file income tax returns in Macau and various foreign jurisdictions as required by law. The Group's income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in the locations where it operates. The Group's 2006 to 2009 Macau income tax returns remain subject to examination by the Macau Finance Bureau and during June 2010, the Macau Finance Bureau commenced examinations of the 2006 and 2007 Macau income tax returns. According to the law, the examination of 2006 and 2007 should be finalized at the latest by 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2012, respectively. The Group believes that the tax reserve established for any uncertain tax issues is adequate with respect to these years. Quarterly, the Group reviews any potentially unfavorable tax outcomes and when an unfavorable outcome is identified as being probable and can be reasonably estimated, the Group then establishes a tax reserve for such possible unfavorable outcome. Estimating potential tax outcomes for any uncertain tax issues is highly judgmental and may not be indicative of the ultimate settlement with the tax authorities. With respect to these items, as at 31 December 2010, the Group has provided a reserve of HK$41.9 million (2009: HK$37.4 million) and included this amount in "other long-term liabilities" with the corresponding charge to current income tax expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The Group believes that it has adequately provided reasonable reserves for prudent and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters. As a result of the lack of authoritative guidance regarding the computation of the Group's Complementary Tax exemptions, the Group establishes reserves for its estimates of additional tax exposures if such exemptions are denied by the Macau tax authorities. 6.

The Board of Directors has not recommended a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2010 (2009: nil). For the year ended 31 December 2009, prior to the Group Reorganization, the Group declared and paid cash distributions of HK$1.0 billion from the income generated through its operations to its former shareholder.

EARNINGS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO OWNERS OF THE COMPANY The calculation of basic earnings per Share for the year ended 31 December 2010 is based on the consolidated net profit attributable to owners of the Company and on the weighted average number of Shares of 5,187,500,000 in issue during the year. The weighted average number of Shares used to calculate the basic earnings per Share for the year ended 31 December 2009, which was 5,040,068,493, included the weighted average of 40,068,493 Shares issued upon the full exercise of the over-allotment option of the Company's Shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 14 October 2009. In addition, it also included the pro forma issued share capital of the Company of 5,000,000,000 Shares, comprising the following and on the assumption that the Group Reorganization had been effective on 1 January 2009: (a) the one share of the Company allotted and issued at HK$1 paid on 4 September 2009 and subdivided into 1,000 Shares of par value of HK$0.001 each (note 20 (iii)); and (b) the 3,749,999,000 Shares issued pursuant to the Group Reorganization on 8 October 2009 and the 1,250,000,000 Shares issued pursuant to the Company's initial public offering on 9 October 2009 (note 20 (iv)). The diluted earnings per Share amount for the year ended 31 December 2010 is calculated based on the consolidated net profit attributable to owners of the Company and on the weighted average number of 5,187,500,000 Shares in issue plus nil potential shares arising from exercise of share options (see also note 22). The diluted earnings per Share for the year ended 31 December 2009 equals to the basic earnings per Share for that period as there were no potential dilutive Shares outstanding during that period.

In 2004, the Group also paid approximately MOP144.2 million (approximately HK$140.0 million) to an unrelated third party for its relinquishment of rights to a portion of the said land under concession. Also in November 2009, the Group paid MOP113.4 million (approximately HK$110.1 million) to the Macau government related to government required modifications to the land concession due to the construction of Encore at Wynn Macau, the expansion of Wynn Macau and the additional square footage added as a result of all such construction and expansion. In May 2010, WRM purchased a house for the use by one of the Group's executives as described in note 26 to the financial statements which included a land lease right of MOP34.3 million (approximately HK$33.3 million).

Annual Report 2010 107 Financial Statements Notes to Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2010 10. GOODWILL In September 2004, the Group acquired all of the 17.5% indirect ownership interests in WRM held by third parties, in exchange for 1,333,333 shares of Wynn Resorts, Limited's common stock. Mr. Wong Chi Seng, one of the third parties, retained a direct 10% voting and social interest in WRM and agreed to continue to serve as Executive Director. The acquired shares provide, in aggregate, a nominal preferential annual dividend and capital distribution rights of up to one Macau pataca. As a result of the acquisition, WRM became an indirectly wholly owned subsidiary of the Group. In accordance with the Group's accounting policy for the acquisition of minority interests, the assets and liabilities of WRM were not restated to reflect their fair values at the date of the acquisition. The difference between the purchase price and the minorities' share of the assets and liabilities reflected within the consolidated statement of financial position of HK$398.3 million at the date of the acquisition was recorded as goodwill. The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit ("CGU") has been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period. Management determined the financial budgets based on past performance and its expectations for market development. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rate stated below. The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations are as follows: 2010 2009 Growth rate (i) 3% 3% Discount rate (ii) 1.9% 2.5% Notes: (i) Weighted average growth rate is used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period which does not exceed the historical trend of the CGUs. The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports. (ii) Pre-tax discount rate has been applied to the cash flow projections. The discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the Group. During the year ended 31 December 2010, there was no impairment of any of its CGUs containing goodwill with indefinite useful lives (2009: nil).

The WRM Term Loan is comprised of two individual facilities, a Hotel Facility and a Project Facility, each containing U.S. dollar and HK dollar tranches. The Hotel Facility is separated into Tranche A (US$10,250,000) and Tranche B (HK$639,600,000). The Project Facility is separated into Tranche A (US$18,500,000), Tranche B (HK$2,451,150,000) and Tranche C (US$125,000,000). The WRM Revolver is also comprised of two individual facilities, a Hotel Facility and a Project Facility, each containing U.S. dollar and HK dollar tranches.

The senior credit facilities described in this paragraph are collectively referred to herein as the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.
 
Annual Report 2010 117 Financial Statements Notes to Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2010 19. INTEREST-BEARING LOANS AND BORROWINGS (continued) The WRM Term Loan matures in June 2014, and the WRM Revolver matures in June 2012. The principal amount of the WRM Term Loan is required to be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing in September 2011. Borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities bear interest at LIBOR or HIBOR plus a margin of 1.75% through 30 September 2010. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2010, the WRM Revolver, the WRM Term Loan Hotel Facility and the WRM Term Loan Project Facility Tranches A and B are subject to a margin of 1.25% to 2.00% depending on the Group's leverage ratio at the end of each quarter. The WRM Term Loan Project Facility Tranche C remains subject to a margin of 1.75%. As at 31 December 2010, the weighted average margin is 1.29%. Collateral for the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities consists of substantially all of the assets of the Group. In addition, the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities documentation contains affirmative and negative covenants which impose various obligations and restrictions on Wynn Macau, and in some cases, the Group. The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain customary covenants restricting certain activities including, but not limited to: the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the incurrence or creation of liens on any of its property, sales and leaseback transactions, the ability to dispose of assets, and make loans or other investments. In addition, the Group is required by the financial covenants to maintain a Leverage Ratio, as defined, of not greater than 4 to 1 as at 31 December 2010, and an Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined, of not less than 2 to 1. Management believes that the Group was in compliance with all covenants as at 31 December 2010. Going forward, the Group is required to maintain a Leverage Ratio not greater than 3.75 to 1 for the quarterly reporting periods ending 30 June 2011 and 30 September 2011 and 3.50 to 1 for the quarterly reporting period ending 31 December 2011. The Interest Coverage Ratio requirement remains at not less than 2 to 1 for all 2011 reporting periods. Additionally, the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain a requirement that the Group must make mandatory prepayments of indebtedness from specified percentages of excess cash flow. If WRM meets a Leverage Ratio, as defined, of greater than 4 to 1 at any reporting period, such required prepayment is 50% of Excess Cash Flow, as defined. If the Leverage Ratio is less than 4 to 1 at any reporting period, then no prepayment is required. Based on current estimates, the Group does not believe that the Wynn Macau Leverage Ratio during the fiscal year ending 31 December 2011 will exceed 4 to 1. Accordingly, the Group does not expect to make any mandatory prepayments pursuant to this requirement during 2011.
 
118 Wynn Macau, Limited Financial Statements Notes to Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2010 19. INTEREST-BEARING LOANS AND BORROWINGS (continued) In connection with the initial financing of Wynn Macau, the Group entered into a bank guarantee reimbursement agreement with Banco Nacional Ultramarino, S.A. ("BNU") to secure a guarantee currently in the amount of MOP300 million (approximately HK$291.3 million) until 180 days after the end of the term of the Concession Agreement. This guarantee, which is for the benefit of the Macau government, assures certain aspects of the Group's performance under the Concession Agreement, including the payment of premiums, fines and indemnities for any material failures to perform under the terms of the Concession Agreement. BNU, as issuer of the guarantee, is currently secured by a second priority security interest in the senior lender collateral package. From and after repayment of all indebtedness under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, the Group is obligated to promptly, upon demand by BNU, repay any claim made on the guarantee by the Macau government. BNU currently is paid an annual fee for the guarantee not to exceed approximately MOP5.2 million (approximately HK$5 million). In September 2009, the Group entered into certain amendments to the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities in order to facilitate the restructuring needed to effect the listing of the Company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The Group repaid HK$5.0 billion of the WRM Revolver in 2010 and, accordingly, as at 31 December 2010, the Group has HK$7.0 billion available under the credit facilities. In 2011, approximately HK$576.5 million of the WRM Term Loan is due. Such amount has been classified as a non-current liability as at 31 December 2010 in accordance with IAS 1 (Revised) as WRM expects and has the discretion and ability to repay this amount with borrowings available under the WRM Revolver, which is not due until June 2012. Fair value of long-term debt The estimated fair value of the Group's outstanding debt instruments was approximately HK$4.7 billion (2009: HK$7.0 billion) with a book value of HK$5.0 billion (2009: HK$8.0 billion) at the reporting date.

Annual Report 2010 123 Financial Statements Notes to Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2010 22. SHARE-BASED PAYMENT PLAN The Company's share option scheme The Company established a share option scheme on 16 September 2009 with the purpose of rewarding participants, which may include Directors and employees of the Group, who have contributed to the Group and to encourage them to work towards enhancing the value of the Company and its Shares for the benefit of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole. Under the rules of the share option scheme, the maximum number of Shares which can be issued upon exercise of all options granted under the share option scheme and of the Company shall not, in the absence of shareholders' approval, in aggregate exceed 10% in nominal amount of the aggregate of Shares in issue on the date of the listing of the Shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (the "Scheme Mandate Limit"); and the Scheme Mandate Limit may be renewed subject to Shareholders' approval. The Scheme Mandate Limit was refreshed at the Company's annual general meeting for the year ended 31 December 2009. Following the refreshment, a maximum of 518.75 million shares have been reserved for issuance under the share option scheme. The options granted under the share option scheme do not give immediate ownership of the underlying Shares as they require payment of a subscription price which is based on the then prevailing market price of the Shares. For the year ended 31 December 2010, 1 million options were granted to certain Directors of the Company and no options were exercised, lapsed or cancelled. As at 31 December 2010, 1 million options (2009: nil) were outstanding. The fair value of the 1 million options granted during the year 31 December 2010 was estimated at HK$4.66 per option based on the Black-Scholes valuation model. The significant inputs used in the model were a share price of HK$10.68 on the date of grant, an exercise price of HK$10.92, an expected stock price volatility of 40.76%, an expected life of options of 6.5 years, an expected dividend yield of 0% and an annual risk-free interest rate of approximately 2.4%. Changes in the subjective input assumptions could materially affect the fair value estimate. WRL Stock Plan Wynn Resorts, Limited established the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (the "WRL Stock Plan") which provides for the grant of (i) incentive stock options, (ii) compensatory (i.e. non qualified) stock options, and (iii) non-vested shares of Wynn Resorts, Limited's common stock for employees, directors and independent contractors or consultants of Wynn Resorts, Limited and its subsidiaries, including the Group. However, only employees are eligible to receive incentive stock options. A maximum of 12,750,000 shares (31 December 2009: 9,750,000 shares) of Wynn Resorts, Limited's common stock have been reserved for issuance under the WRL Stock Plan. As at 31 December 2010, 4,107,378 (2009: 419,545) shares remain available for the grant of stock options or non-vested shares of Wynn Resorts, Limited's common stock.

PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS In April 2005, the Group established a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme (the "Scheme"). The Scheme allows eligible employees to contribute 5% of their salary to the Scheme and the Group matches the contributions with an equal amount. The assets of the Scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund. The Group's matching contributions vest to the employee at 10% per year with full vesting in ten years. Forfeitures of unvested contributions are used to reduce the Group's liability for its contributions payable under the Scheme. In May 2010, the Group reinstated matching the contribution with an amount equal to the employee contributions after stopping the contribution in March 2009. The Group recorded an expense for matching contributions of approximately HK$25.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2010 (2009: HK$4.4 million). 24.

These services consist of a limited number of executives in relevant areas assisting the Group on U.S. regulatory and certain limited other matters. The assistance includes guidance on certain issues and ensuring that, from a regulatory standpoint, Wynn Resorts, Limited's standard operating procedures are followed and maintained by the Group. The annual fee for the services provided by Wynn Resorts, Limited is based on an allocation of the actual proportion of Wynn Resorts, Limited's annual corporate departments' costs (including salaries and benefits for such employees during the period in which such services are rendered) and overhead expense related to the provision of such services, and in any event, such annual fee shall not exceed 50% of the aggregate annual corporate departments' costs and overhead expenses incurred by Wynn Resorts, Limited during any financial year. Similarly, WML and WRM had reciprocal arrangements to allow Wynn Resorts, Limited or its subsidiaries (other than the Group) to have access to the services of any of the Group's employees provided that such services do not materially interfere with such employees' obligations to, and responsibilities with, the Group. For services provided by the Group's employees, Wynn Resorts, Limited shall pay for the services based on an actual cost (including salaries and benefits for such employees during the period when such services are being rendered) and expenses on a reimbursement basis. Wynn Resorts, Limited allows WRM and certain of its employees to use aircraft assets owned by Wynn Resorts, Limited and its subsidiaries (other than the Group) at hourly rates set by Las Vegas Jet, LLC, a subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, Limited. Similarly, WRM has reciprocal arrangements to allow Wynn Resorts, Limited or its subsidiaries (other than the Group) to use any aircraft assets that the Group could own in the future. (ii) Royalty fees Prior to Listing, WRM had an arrangement with Wynn Resorts, Limited and Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLC (together, the "Licensors") under which the Licensors licensed to WRM certain trademarks and service marks, other marks and works, domain names, and hotel casino design, development and management know-how (collectively, the "Intellectual Property Rights").

Pursuant to the IP License Arrangement, the Licensors licensed to each of the Company and WRM the right to use the Intellectual Property Rights using the same pricing basis as described below. The IP License Arrangement is also subject to restrictions in the agreements between Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLC or Wynn Resorts, Limited and any third parties, including Mr. Stephen A.

The calculation of each licensee's operating revenues, promotional allowances, and commissions and discounts in connection with the IP gross revenues stated in the intellectual property license agreements shall always be consistent with the Group's accounting policies and prepared in accordance with IFRSs as in effect from 31 December 2008. If any other subsidiary of the Company (other than WRM) acquires the Intellectual Property Rights under the intellectual property license agreement between the Company and the Licensors, "IP gross revenues" and "IP monthly gross revenues" will be interpreted to include the gross revenues of such relevant subsidiary. The following table presents a reconciliation of total operating revenues (as reported in the these financial statements) to WRM's IP gross revenues as used for the purposes of the IP License Arrangement between WRM and the Licensors.

Upon Ms. Chen's termination for "cause", Ms. Chen will be deemed to have elected to purchase the Macau house based on the applicable Discount Percentage unless Worldwide Wynn determines to not require Ms. Chen to purchase the house. If Ms. Chen's employment terminates for any other reason before the expiration of the term (e.g., because of her death or disability or due to revocation of gaming license), the option will terminate.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES The Group's principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, accounts payable and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group's construction activities and its operations. The Group has various financial assets such as trade receivables and cash and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations. The Group also enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps contracts. The purpose is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Group's operations and its sources of finance. It is, and has been throughout 2010 and 2009, the Group's policy that no trading in derivatives should be undertaken. The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees upon policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarized below.
 
Annual Report 2010 141 Financial Statements Notes to Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2010 27. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (continued) Interest rate risk The Group's primary exposure is changes in market interest rates associated with its bank loans that bear interest based on variable rates. The Group attempts to manage interest rate risk by managing the mix of long-term fixed rate borrowings through interest rate swap arrangements and variable rate borrowings. These risk management strategies may not always have the desired effect, and interest rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on the results of operations. Interest rate sensitivity As at 31 December 2010 and 2009, all of the interest-bearing loans and borrowings were variable rate borrowings based on LIBOR or HIBOR plus a margin. However, the Group has entered into interest rate swaps that effectively fix the interest rate for approximately 89% of the interest-bearing loans in 2010 (2009: 55%). Based on borrowings at 31 December 2010, an assumed 1% change in the variable rates would cause the annual interest expenses, without adjusting for any amounts to be capitalized, to change by HK$5.5 million (2009: HK$36.7 million) Foreign currency risk The financial statements of foreign operations are translated into Hong Kong dollars, the Group's presentation currency, for incorporation into the consolidated financial statements. Assets and liabilities are translated at the prevailing foreign exchange rates in effect at the statement of financial position date. Income, expenditure and cash flow items are measured at the actual foreign exchange rates or average foreign exchange rates for the period. The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years. However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca to the U.S. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to, among other things, changes in governmental policies and international economic and political developments. Foreign currency sensitivity As at 31 December 2010 and 2009, the Group was in a net liability position where the Group had more liabilities than assets that were denominated in currencies (primarily U.S. dollars) other than the functional currency. Based on the liability position at 31 December 2010, an assumed 1% increase or decrease in the value of the Hong Kong dollar against the U.S. dollar, the Group would recognize a gain or loss of HK$10.5 million (2009: HK$10.8 million).
 
142 Wynn Macau, Limited Financial Statements Notes to Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2010 27. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (continued) Credit risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of casino accounts receivable. The Group issues credit in the form of markers to approved casino customers following investigations of creditworthiness. The Group maintains strict control over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursues collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances on a timely basis. These collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies, and litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in Macau, however, markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some other countries. The collectibility of markers given to foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers' home countries. Further quantitative data in respect of the Group's exposure to credit risk arising from trade and other receivables are disclosed in note 14 to the financial statements. Liquidity risk The Group measures and monitors its liquidity structure based on the overall assets, liabilities and debt, and maintains a conservative level of liquid assets to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to meet any unexpected and material cash requirements in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the Group's senior bank facility's governing documents contain capital spending limits and other affirmative and negative covenants which require the maintenance of secure capital procedures. As at 31 December 2010, the Group held interest rate swaps at fair value with liabilities measured at fair value for level 2 of HK$101.1 million (2009: HK$126.8 million), and the Group has not held any assets or liabilities measured at fair value for levels 1 and 3 during the years where level 1 fair value represented fair values measured using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical financial instruments, level 2 fair values measured using quoted prices in active markets for similar financial instruments, or using valuation techniques in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly based on observable market data and level 3 fair values measured using valuation techniques in which any significant input is not based on observable market data.
