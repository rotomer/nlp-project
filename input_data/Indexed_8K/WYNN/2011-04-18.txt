Item 8.01.  Other Events.
Wynn Resorts, Limited (the Company) has determined that the stock performance graph it voluntarily included in Item 5 of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 (the 2010 10-K) failed to reflect the reinvestment of dividends on the Companys common stock, and therefore under-reported the Companys stock price performance.  A revised stock performance graph is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.  Exhibit 99.1 supersedes the section titled Stock Performance Graph set forth in Item 5 of the 2010 10-K.
Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 9.01.  Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
(d)   Exhibits
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
Date:           April 18, 2011
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Stock Performance Graph
The graph below compares the five year cumulative total return on the common stock of Wynn Resorts, Limited (the Company) to the cumulative total return of the Standard & Poors 500 Stock Index (S&P 500) and the Dow Jones US Gambling Index. The performance graph assumes that $100 was invested on December 31, 2005 in each of the Companys common stock, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones US Gambling Index, and that all dividends were reinvested. The stock price performance shown in this graph is neither necessarily indicative of, nor intended to suggest, future stock price performance.
 
 
 
 
 
The performance graph should not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other of the Companys filings under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act of 1934, unless the Company specifically incorporate the performance graph by reference therein.
