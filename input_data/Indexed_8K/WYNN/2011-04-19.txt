LAS VEGAS, April 19, 2011 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Wynn Resorts, Limited (Nasdaq: WYNN) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011.
 
Net revenues for the first quarter of 2011 were $1,260.3 million, compared to $908.9 million in the first quarter of 2010. The revenue increase was driven by a 46.6% increase in revenues at Wynn Macau and a 24.0% revenue increase from our Las Vegas operations. Adjusted property EBITDA(1) was $405.0 million for the first quarter of 2011, compared to $241.9 million in the first quarter of 2010.
 
On a US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) basis, net income attributable to Wynn Resorts for the first quarter of 2011 was $173.8 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, compared to a net income attributable to Wynn Resorts of $27.0 million, or $0.22 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010.

Wynn Macau First Quarter Results
 
In the first quarter of 2011 net revenues were $865.7 million compared to $590.6 million in the first quarter of 2010. Adjusted property EBITDA in the first quarter of 2011 was $272.8 million, up 50.2% from $181.6 million in the first quarter of 2010.
 
Table games results in Macau are segregated into two distinct reporting categories, the VIP segment and the mass market segment.
 
Table games turnover in the VIP segment was $29.3 billion for the first quarter of 2011, a 44.7% increase from $20.2 billion in the first quarter of 2010. VIP table games win as a percentage of turnover (calculated before discounts and commissions) for the quarter was 2.69%, slightly below the expected range of 2.7% to 3.0% and the 2.70% experienced in the first quarter of 2010.
 
Table games drop in the mass market category was $682.5 million during the period, a 29.2% increase from $528.2 million in the first quarter of 2010.  Mass market table games win percentage (calculated before discounts) of 27.9% was above our expected range of 21% to 23% and above the 22.2% generated in the 2010 quarter.
 
Slot machine handle increased 59.2% to $1.5 billion as compared to the prior year quarter. Win per unit per day was 78.1% higher at $803, compared to $451 in the first quarter of 2010.

The 2011 results include the addition of 414 rooms and villas with the opening of Encore on April 21, 2010. The propertys occupancy was 88.6%, compared to 90.7% during the prior year period and revenue per available room (REVPAR) was $272 in the 2011 quarter, 6.3% above the $256 reported in the prior year quarter.
 
Gross non-casino revenues at Wynn Macau increased 50.2% during the quarter to $94.2 million, driven by strong performance from all non-casino segments. Room revenues increased 79.1% as a result of the addition of the Encore rooms and retail revenues were up 37.7% due to strong same-store sales growth and the addition of three new boutiques at Encore.
 
Including Encore, we currently have 499 tables (263 VIP tables, 225 mass market tables and 11 poker tables) and 1,015 slot machines at Wynn Macau.

Forward-looking Statements
 
This release contains forward-looking statements regarding operating trends and future results of operations.  Such forward-looking information involves important risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect anticipated results in the future and, accordingly, such results may differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, competition in the casino/hotel and resorts industries, the Companys dependence on existing management, levels of travel, leisure and casino spending, general economic conditions, and changes in gaming laws or regulations. Additional information concerning potential factors that could affect the Company's financial results is included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and the Company's other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company is under no obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligation to) update its forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures
 
(1) Adjusted property EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening costs, property charges and other, corporate expenses, stock-based compensation, and other non-operating income and expenses, and includes equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates.  Adjusted property EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses adjusted property EBITDA as a measure of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors.  The Company also presents adjusted property EBITDA because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a companys ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements.  Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDA as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including Wynn Resorts, Limited, have historically excluded from their EBITDA calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses and stock-based compensation, that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties.  However, adjusted property EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Companys performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.  Unlike net income, adjusted property EBITDA does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. The Company has significant uses of cash

flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in adjusted property EBITDA.  Also, Wynn Resorts calculation of adjusted property EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
 
 (2) attributable to Wynn Resorts attributable to Wynn Resorts attributable to Wynn Resortsand/orattributable to Wynn Resorts income attributable to Wynn Resorts per share may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
