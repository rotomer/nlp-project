LAS VEGAS, July 18, 2011 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Wynn Resorts, Limited (Nasdaq: WYNN) today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2011.
 
Net revenues for the second quarter of 2011 were $1,367.4 million, compared to $1,032.6 million in the second quarter of 2010. The revenue increase was driven by a 36.7% increase in revenues at Wynn Macau and a 22.8% revenue increase from our Las Vegas operations. Adjusted property EBITDA (1) was $447.0 million for the second quarter of 2011, 58.9% above the $281.4 million reported in the second quarter of 2010.
 
On a US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) basis, net income attributable to Wynn Resorts for the second quarter of 2011 was $122.0 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, compared to a net income attributable to Wynn Resorts of $52.4 million, or $0.42 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010. Net income for the second quarter of 2011 included a $107.5 million charge representing the present value of a charitable contribution made by Wynn Macau to the University of Macau Development Foundation. This contribution consists of a $25 million contribution made in May 2011, and a commitment for additional donations of $10 million each year for the calendar years 2012 through 2022 inclusive, for a total of $135 million.
 
Adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts in the second quarter of 2011 was $200.8 million, or $1.60 per diluted share (adjusted EPS)(2) compared to an adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts of $64.9 million, or $0.52 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010.

Wynn Macau Second Quarter Results
 
In the second quarter of 2011, net revenues were $976.5 million, a 36.7% increase from the $714.4 million generated in the second quarter of 2010. Adjusted property EBITDA in the second quarter of 2011 was $314.3 million, up 45.4% from $216.2 million in the second quarter of 2010.
 
Table games results in Macau are segregated into two distinct reporting categories, the VIP segment and the mass market segment.
 
Table games turnover in the VIP segment was $32.7 billion for the second quarter of 2011, a 50.6% increase from $21.7 billion in the second quarter of 2010. VIP table games win as a percentage of turnover (calculated before discounts and commissions) for the quarter was 2.89%, in-line with the expected range of 2.7% to 3.0% and lower than the 3.22% experienced in the second quarter of 2010.
 
Table games drop in the mass market category was $690.3 million during the period, a 25.9% increase from $548.1 million in the second quarter of 2010.  Mass market table games win percentage (calculated before discounts) of 27.8% was in-line with our revised range and higher than the 22.9% generated in the 2010 quarter. We have increased our expected mass market range from 21%-23% to  26%-28% based on our experience since the opening of Encore.
 
Slot machine handle increased 40.7% to $1.5 billion as compared to the prior year quarter. Win per unit per day was 73.2% higher at $791, compared to $457 in the second quarter of 2010.
 
Wynn Macau achieved an Average Daily Rate (ADR) of $314 for the second quarter of 2011, 9.4% above the $287 reported in the 2010 quarter.  The June 30, 2011 results include the full contribution from Encore, which added 414 rooms and villas and opened on April 21, 2010. The propertys occupancy was 90.5%, compared to 81.3% during the prior year period and revenue per available room (REVPAR) was $284 in the 2011 quarter, 21.8% above the $234 reported in the prior year quarter.
 
Gross non-casino revenues at Wynn Macau increased 33.6% during the quarter to $94.6 million, driven by strong performance from all non-casino segments.
 
Including Encore, we currently have 493 tables (265 VIP tables, 217 mass market tables and 11 poker tables) and 1,053 slot machines at Wynn Macau.

Non-GAAP financial measures
 
(1) Adjusted property EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening costs, property charges and other, corporate expenses, stock-based compensation, and other non-operating income and expenses, and includes equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates.  Adjusted property EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses adjusted property EBITDA as a measure of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors.  The Company also presents adjusted property EBITDA because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a companys ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements.  Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDA as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including Wynn Resorts, Limited, have historically excluded from their EBITDA calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses and stock-based compensation, that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties.  However, adjusted property EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Companys performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.  Unlike net income, adjusted property EBITDA does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in adjusted property EBITDA.  Also, Wynn Resorts calculation of adjusted property EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
 
 (2) attributable to Wynn Resorts attributable to Wynn Resorts attributable to Wynn Resortsand/orattributable to Wynn Resorts income attributable to Wynn Resorts per share may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
