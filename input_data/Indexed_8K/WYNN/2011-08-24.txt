Management Discussion and Analysis
OVERVIEW
Wynn Macau opened to the public on 6 September 2006 at the center of casino activities on the urban Macau peninsula.  In December 2007 and November 2009, Wynn Macau completed expansions, adding more gaming space and additional food and beverage and retail amenities. Encore at Wynn Macau, a further expansion of Wynn Macau that adds a fully integrated resort hotel, opened on 21 April 2010.
Our Macau resort complex features:

The following table presents the number of casino games available at our Macau Operations:
In response to our evaluation of our operations and the feedback from our guests, we have been, and will continue to make enhancements and refinements to our resort complex.
Cotai Development
The Group has applied to the government of Macau for a land concession on approximately 52 acres of land on Cotai and is awaiting final government approval on the concession. Subsequent to government approval, we anticipate the construction of a full scale integrated resort containing a casino, approximately 1,500 rooms, convention, retail, entertainment and food and beverage offerings. We continue to finalize the project scope and budget.
Cotai Land Agreement
On 1 August 2008, Palo Real Estate Company Limited entered into an agreement with a Macau incorporated company that is not a connected person of the Group to make a one-time payment in the amount of US$50 million (approximately HK$389.3 million) in consideration of its relinquishment of certain rights in and to any future development on the approximately 52 acres of land on Cotai. The payment will be made within 15 days after the Macau government publishes the Groups rights to the land in the Macau governments official gazette. The Group has filed an application for the land with the Macau government and is awaiting final approval.
Macau
Macau, which was a territory under Portuguese administration for approximately 450 years, was transferred from Portuguese to Chinese political control in December 1999.  Macau is governed as a special administrative region of China and is located approximately 37 miles southwest of, and less than one hour away via ferry from, Hong Kong.  Macau, which has been a casino destination for more than 40 years, consists principally of a peninsula on mainland China, and two neighboring islands, Taipa and Coloane.  We believe that Macau is located in one of the worlds largest concentrations of potential gaming customers.  According to Macau Statistical Information, casinos in Macau generated approximately HK$120.5 billion in gaming revenue during the six months ended 30 June 2011, an increase of approximately 44.5% over the approximate HK$83.4 billion generated in the six months ended 30 June 2010, making Macau the largest gaming market in the world.

Macaus gaming market is primarily dependent on tourists.  The Macau market has experienced tremendous growth in capacity in the last several years.  As at 31 May 2011, there were 21,518 hotel rooms and as at 30 June 2011, there were 5,237 table games in Macau, compared to 12,978 hotel rooms and 2,760 table games as at 31 December 2006.
FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Tourism
The levels of tourism and overall gaming activities in Macau are key drivers of our business. Both the Macau gaming market and visitation to Macau have grown significantly in the last few years. We have benefited from the rise in visitation to Macau over the past several years.
Gaming customers traveling to Macau typically come from nearby destinations in Asia including mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore.  According to the Macau Statistics and Census Service Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, approximately 89.1% of visitors to Macau in the six months ended 30 June 2011 were from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.
Tourism levels in Macau are affected by a number of factors, all of which are beyond our control. Key factors affecting tourism levels in Macau may include, among others:
Economic and Operating Environment
Our operating environment has remained stable during the six months ended 30 June 2011. However, economic conditions can have a significant impact on our business.  A number of factors, including a slowdown in the global economy, contracting credit markets, reduced consumer spending, various countries policies that affect travel to Macau and any outbreak of infectious diseases can negatively impact the gaming industry in Macau and our business.
 
 
18
 
 
Competition
Since the liberalization of Macaus gaming industry in 2002, there has been a significant increase in the number of gaming operators and casino properties in Macau.  Currently, there are six gaming operators in Macau, including WRM.  The three concessionaires are WRM, SJM, and Galaxy which opened Galaxy Macau, a major resort in the Cotai area, on 15 May 2011.  The three subconcessionaires are Melco Crown, MGM Macau, and Venetian Macau.  As at 30 June 2011, there were approximately 34 casinos in Macau, including 20 operated by SJM.  Each of the current six operators has operating casinos and expansion plans announced or underway.
Wynn Macau also faces competition from casinos primarily located in other areas of Asia, such as Resorts World Sentosa and Marina Bay Sands which opened in February and April 2010, respectively, in Singapore, Genting Highlands Resort located outside of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and casinos in the Philippines.  Wynn Macau also encounters competition from other major gaming centers located around the world, including Australia and Las Vegas, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming, and other casinos throughout Asia.  Further, if current efforts to legalize gaming in other Asian countries are successful, Wynn Macau will face additional regional competition.
Gaming Promoters
A significant amount of our casino play is brought to us by gaming promoters.  Gaming promoters have historically played a critical role in the Macau gaming market and are important to our casino business.
Gaming promoters introduce premium VIP players to Wynn Macau and often assist those clients with their travel and entertainment arrangements.  In addition, gaming promoters often grant credit to their players.  In exchange for their services, Wynn Macau generally pays the gaming promoters a percentage of the gross gaming win generated by each gaming promoter.  Approximately 80% of these commissions are netted against casino revenues, because such commissions approximate the amount of the commission returned to the VIP players by the gaming promoters, and approximately 20% of these commissions are included in other operating expenses, which approximate the amount of the commission ultimately retained by the gaming promoters for their compensation.  The total amount of commissions paid to these promoters and netted against casino revenues were HK$3.8 billion and HK$2.6 billion for the six months ended 30 June 2011 and 2010, respectively.  Commissions increased 47.4% for the six months ended 30 June 2011 compared to the six months ended 30 June 2010, due to increased volumes of play generated by gaming promoters and the addition of two new gaming promoters.  Additionally, gaming promoters each receive a monthly complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the turnover their clients generate.
The allowance is available for room, food and beverage and other products and services for discretionary use with clients.  We typically advance commissions to gaming promoters at the beginning of each month to facilitate their working capital requirements.  These advances are provided to a gaming promoter and are offset by the commissions earned by such gaming promoter during the applicable month.  The aggregate amounts of exposure to our gaming promoters, which
 
 
19
 
 
is the difference between commissions advanced to each individual gaming promoter, and the commissions payable to each such gaming promoter, were HK$361.4 million and HK$61.2 million as at 30 June 2011 and 2010, respectively.  These outstanding commissions were cleared no later than the fifth day of the succeeding month and prior to the advancement of any further funds to a gaming promoter.  We believe we have developed strong relationships with our gaming promoters.  Our commission percentages have remained stable throughout our operating history.
Premium Credit Play
We selectively extend credit to players contingent upon our marketing teams knowledge of the players, their financial background and payment history.  We follow a series of credit procedures and require from each credit recipient various signed documents that are intended to ensure among other things that, if permitted by applicable law, the debt can be legally enforced in the jurisdiction where the player resides.  In the event the player does not reside in a jurisdiction where gaming debts are legally enforceable, we often can assert jurisdiction over assets the player maintains in jurisdictions where gaming debts are recognized.  In addition, we typically require a check in the amount of the applicable credit line from credit players, collateralizing the credit we grant to a player.
Number and Mix of Table Games and Slot Machines
The mix of VIP table games, mass table games and slot machines in operation at our resort changes from time to time as a result of marketing and operating strategies in response to changing market demand and industry competition.  The shift in the mix of our games will affect casino profitability.
ADJUSTED EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before finance costs, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening costs, property charges and other, share-based payments, and other non-operating income/(expense).  Adjusted EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because our Directors believe that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies.  Our Adjusted EBITDA presented herein also differs from the Adjusted EBITDA presented by Wynn Resorts, Limited for its Macau segment in its filings with the SEC, primarily due to the inclusion of royalty fees, adjustments for IFRS differences with U.S. GAAP, corporate support services and other support services in arriving at operating profit.

Discussion of Results of Operations
Financial results for the six months ended 30 June 2011 compared to financial results for the six months ended 30 June 2010
Our results of operations for the periods presented are not comparable as the six months ended 30 June 2011 include the operations of Encore for the full period whereas the six months ended 30 June 2010 only included the operations of Encore from its opening on 21 April 2010 through 30 June 2010.
Operating Revenues
Total operating revenues increased by 41.4% from HK$10.1 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$14.3 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2011. We believe this increase was due to a combination of factors, including increased visitation and overall gaming volumes in Macau during the first half of 2011, as well as the opening of Encore on 21 April 2010.
Casino Revenues
Casino revenues increased by 42.0%, from HK$9.5 billion (93.8% of total operating revenues) in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$13.5 billion (94.2% of total operating revenues) in the six months ended 30 June 2011. The components and reasons are as follows:
  VIP gross table games win increased by 39.4%, from HK$9.7 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$13.5 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2011. VIP table games turnover increased by 48.1%, from HK$325.6 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$482.1 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2011. VIP gross table games win as a percentage of turnover (calculated before discounts and commissions) was 2.97% in the six months ended 30 June 2010 compared to 2.80% in the six months ended 30 June 2011 (win percentages are within the expected range of 2.7% to 3.0%). On 21 April 2010, we added 37 VIP tables with the opening of Encore which helped drive some of the growth in our VIP segment during the six months ended 30 June 2011 compared to the prior year.
VIP casino gaming operations.
  Mass market gross table games win increased by 57.9%, from HK$1.9 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$3.0 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2011. Mass market table games drop increased by 27.8%, from HK$8.4 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$10.7 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2011. The mass market gross table games win percentage (calculated before discounts) was 22.5% in the six months ended 30 June 2010 compared to 27.8% in the six months ended 30 June 2011, which was within the expected win percentage range of 26% to 28%. We have increased our expected mass market range to 26%28% based on our experience since the opening of Encore.
Mass market casino gaming operations.

  Slot machine win increased by 52.9% from HK$753.2 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$1.2 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2011.  Slot machine handle increased by 49.5%, from HK$15.5 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$23.1 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2011.  The increases resulted primarily from increased visitation to our resort and the opening of Encore in April 2010.  Consequently, total gross slot win increased and slot machine win per unit per day increased by 75.9% from HK$3,526 in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$6,202 in the six months ended 30 June 2011.
Slot machine gaming operations.
Non-casino Revenues
Net non-casino revenues, which include rooms, food and beverage and retail and other revenues, increased by 31.6%, from HK$629.1 million (6.2% of total operating revenues) in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$827.8 million (5.8% of total operating revenues) in the six months ended 30 June 2011.  The increase in revenues was largely due to stronger retail sales in the six months ended 30 June 2011 and the opening of Encore in April 2010.
  Our room revenues, which exclude promotional allowances in our condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income, increased by 15.5% from HK$57.0 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$65.9 million in the six months ended 30 June 2011.  The increase is due to the 414 additional suites added with the addition of Encore in April 2010 and the increase in average daily room rate and occupancy rate compared to the prior year.
Room.
Management also evaluates room revenues on an adjusted basis which include promotional allowances.  Adjusted room revenues including promotional allowances increased by 52.6% from HK$287.5 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$438.7 million in the six months ended 30 June 2011.
The following table presents additional information about our adjusted room revenues (which include promotional allowances):

  Food and beverage revenues, which exclude promotional allowances in our condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income, totaled HK$94.2 million in the six months ended 30 June 2011, a 23.9% increase from the six months ended 30 June 2010 revenues of HK$76.0 million. The increase reflects higher business volumes and the opening of Encore in April 2010.
Food and beverage.
Management also evaluates food and beverage revenues on an adjusted basis including promotional allowances. Food and beverage revenues in the six months ended 30 June 2011, adjusted to include these promotional allowances were HK$346.5 million, a 40.5% increase from the six months ended 30 June 2010 adjusted revenues of HK$246.6 million reflecting the increase in business volumes and the opening of Encore in April 2010.
  Our retail and other revenues, which exclude promotional allowances in our condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income, increased by 34.6%, from HK$496.0 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$667.7 million in the six months ended 30 June 2011. The increase was due primarily to increased same-store sales and new outlets at Encore including Chanel, Piaget and Cartier.
Retail and other.
Management also evaluates retail and other revenues on an adjusted basis which includes promotional allowances. Adjusted retail and other revenues including promotional allowances increased by 36.0% from HK$503.2 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$684.1 million in the six months ended 30 June 2011, reflecting the increased same-store sales and the new outlets at Encore.
Operating Costs and Expenses
  Gaming taxes and premiums increased by 42.5%, from HK$4.9 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$7.0 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2011. This increase was due to increased gross gaming win from the six months ended 30 June 2011 compared to the six months ended 30 June 2010. Wynn Macau is subject to a 35% gaming tax on gross gaming win. In addition, Wynn Macau is also required to pay 4% of its gross gaming win as contributions for public development and social facilities.
Gaming taxes and premiums.
  Staff costs increased by 16.7%, from HK$879.2 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$1,026.1 million in the six months ended 30 June 2011. The increase was primarily due to the hiring of additional staff for Encore.
Staff costs.
  Other operating expenses increased by 34.0%, from HK$1.8 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$2.5 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2011. The increase in other operating costs was primarily due to the opening of Encore.
Other operating expenses.
  Depreciation and amortization increased by 21.4% from HK$445.4 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$540.6 million in the six months ended 30 June 2011. This increase was primarily due to the impact of assets placed in service with the opening of Encore in April 2010.
Depreciation and amortization.
 
 
26
 
 
  Property charges and other increased from HK$22.9 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$849.3 million in the six months ended 30 June 2011. Included in property charges and other for the six months ended 30 June 2011 is a charge of HK$831.1 million reflecting the present value of a charitable contribution made by WRM to the University of Macau Development Foundation. This contribution consists of a MOP200.0 million (approximately HK$194.2 million) payment made in May 2011, and a commitment for additional donations of MOP80.0 million (approximately HK$77.7 million) each year for the calendar years 2012 through 2022 inclusive, for a total of MOP1,080.0 million (approximately HK$1,048.5 million). The amount reflected in our accompanying condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income has been discounted using our current estimated borrowing rate over the time period of the remaining committed payments. Other charges in each period represent gain/ loss on the sale of equipment as well as costs related to assets retired or abandoned as a result of renovating certain assets of Wynn Macau in response to customer preferences and changes in market demand.
Property charges and other.
As a result of the foregoing, total operating costs and expenses increased by 46.7%, from HK$8.1 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$11.9 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2011.
Finance Revenues
Finance revenues increased from HK$0.3 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$9.9 million in the six months ended 30 June 2011. During 2011 and 2010, our short-term investment strategy has been to preserve capital while retaining sufficient liquidity. While we have recently invested in certain corporate debt securities which contributed to the increase in interest income, the majority of our short-term investments are primarily in time deposits with a maturity of three months or less.
Finance Costs
Finance costs increased by 26.9%, from HK$107.1 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$135.9 million in the six months ended 30 June 2011. Finance costs increased in the six months ended 30 June 2011 primarily due to the reduction in capitalized interest for Encore which opened in April 2010, offset in part by the reduction in amounts outstanding under the revolver component of the Wynn Macau Credit Facility and lower interest rates in 2011 compared to 2010.
Interest Rate Swaps
As required under the terms of our various credit facilities, we have entered into agreements which swap a portion of the interest on our loans from floating to fixed rates. These transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as an increase or decrease in swap fair value during each period. We recorded a gain of HK$46.7 million for the six months ended 30 June 2011 resulting from the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps in the six months ended 30 June 2011. We recorded an expense of HK$5.6 million in the six months ended 30 June
 
 
27
 
 
2010 resulting from the decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swaps in the six months ended 30 June 2010.
Income Tax Expense
For the six months ended 30 June 2011, our income tax expense was HK$3.5 million compared to an income tax expense of HK$36.1 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010. Our current tax expense for the six months ended 30 June 2011 primarily relates to the current tax expense of our subsidiaries owning WRMs shares under the WRM Shareholder Dividend Tax Agreement. In the six months ended 30 June 2010, our income tax expense mainly related to the amount accrued for the WRM Shareholder Dividend Tax Agreement and a deferred tax expense recorded by WRM resulting from derecognizing certain deferred tax assets.
Net Profit Attributable to Owners of the Company
As a result of the foregoing, net profit attributable to owners of the Company increased by 26.5%, from HK$1.9 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$2.4 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2011.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Capital Resources
Since Wynn Macau opened in 2006, we have generally funded our working capital and recurring expenses as well as capital expenditures from cash flow from operations and cash on hand.
Our cash balances as at 30 June 2011 were HK$7.5 billion. Such cash is available for operations, new development activities, enhancements to Wynn Macau and Encore and general corporate purposes.  In addition, as at 30 June 2011, we had HK$7.7 billion available to draw under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.
Investments
As at 30 June 2011, the Group had net investments in Offshore RMB denominated debt securities with maturities of up to three years that amounted to Offshore RMB214.3 million (approximately HK$257.8 million) compared to nil as at 31 December 2010.
Gearing Ratio
The gearing ratio is a key indicator of our Groups capital structure. The gearing ratio is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt. The table below presents the calculation of our gearing ratio as at 30 June 2011 and 31 December 2010.

Cash Flows
The following table presents a summary of the Groups cash flows for the six months ended 30 June
2011 and 2010.

Net cash generated from operating activities
Our net cash generated from operating activities is primarily affected by operating profit generated by our Macau Operations as a result of increased casino revenues, continued costs control, and benefits from changes in working capital. Net cash from operating activities was HK$4.9 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2011 compared to HK$2.8 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2010.
Operating profit was HK$2.5 billion for the six months ended 30 June 2011 compared to HK$2.1 billion for the six months ended 30 June 2010.
Net cash used in investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities was HK$393.0 million in the six months ended 30 June 2011, compared to net cash used in investing activities of HK$818.4 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010.
Capital expenditures were HK$141.0 million for the six months ended 30 June 2011, and related primarily to renovation projects to enhance and refine the Macau Operations. Capital expenditures for the six months ended 30 June 2010 were HK$771.9 million and related primarily to the construction of Encore.
Net cash used in financing activities
Net cash used in financing activities was HK$890.4 million during the six months ended 30 June 2011 compared to HK$3.0 billion during the six months ended 30 June 2010.
The difference between net cash flow used in 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily due to a HK$2.9 billion repayment of the senior revolving credit facility under Wynn Macau Credit Facilities made in 2010 compared to a HK$779.5 million repayment of the facilities made in 2011.
Indebtedness
The following table presents a summary of our indebtedness as at 30 June 2011 and 31 December 2010.

Indebtedness information
The Group had approximately HK$7.7 billion available to draw under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities as at 30 June 2011.
 
Wynn Macau Credit Facilities
 
Overview
 
As at 30 June 2011, WRMs credit facilities consisted of HK$12.0 billion in a combination of Hong Kong dollar and U.S. dollar facilities, including a HK$4.3 billion fully funded senior term loan facility and a HK$7.7 billion senior revolving credit facility. The facilities may be used for a variety of purposes, including further enhancements at our resort, investments in other projects in Macau and general corporate purposes.
We have the ability to increase secured debt under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities by up to an additional US$50 million (approximately HK$389.3 million).
As at 30 June 2011, we had total bank and other borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities of HK$4.3 billion, of which HK$1.2 billion was denominated in U.S. dollars and HK$3.1 billion was denominated in Hong Kong dollars.
In July 2009, as part of the Group Reorganization, WRM requested and obtained from its syndicate lenders under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities certain consents necessary to permit the Group Reorganization. As a result, WM Cayman Holdings Limited II became the highest level obligor, guarantor and chargor under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities and Wynn Group Asia, Inc. ceased to be an obligor, guarantor or chargor under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.
The Company is not a party to the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities and has no rights or obligations thereunder.

The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain customary covenants restricting certain activities of the obligor group (WM Cayman Holdings Limited II and all of its subsidiaries except Palo Real Estate Company Limited), which does not include the Company, including, but not limited to, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the incurrence or creation of liens on property, sale and leaseback transactions, the ability to dispose of assets and the making of loans or certain other investments, entering into mergers, consolidations, liquidations or amalgamations, forming or acquiring subsidiaries, amending, modifying or terminating certain material contracts, permits and governing documents, entering into certain transactions with affiliates, changing fiscal periods, entering into business activities other than certain permitted activities, and selling or discounting receivables, in each case, subject to certain permitted exceptions.
Financial Covenants
The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities financial covenants require WRM to maintain a Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, of not greater than 3.75 to 1 as at 30 June 2011, and an Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined in the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, of not less than 2 to 1. Management believes that the Group was in compliance with all covenants as at 30 June 2011. Going forward, the Group is required to maintain a Leverage Ratio not greater than 3.75 to 1 for the quarterly reporting period ending 30 September 2011 and 3.50 to 1 for the quarterly reporting period ending 31 December 2011. The Interest Coverage Ratio requirement remains at not less than 2 to 1 for all 2011 reporting periods.
Compliance with Covenants
The Directors confirm that there is no material non-compliance with the financial covenants or general covenants contained in the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.
Mandatory Prepayment
The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain mandatory prepayment provisions, which include, among other matters, prepayment of 50% of Excess Cash Flow, as defined in the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, if WRMs Leverage Ratio is greater than 4 to 1 for any reporting period. For the six months ended 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2010, the Excess Cash Flow prepayment did not apply as WRMs Leverage Ratio was not in excess of 4 to 1 for either period.

Dividend Restrictions
WRM and certain of its affiliates are subject to restrictions on payment of dividends or distributions or other amounts to their shareholders or to other affiliates, unless certain financial and non- financial criteria have been satisfied. Provided certain conditions are met, WRM is permitted to pay dividends. The conditions to be satisfied for the payment of dividends include:
WRM is currently in compliance with all requirements, namely satisfaction of its Leverage Ratio, which must be met in order to pay dividends and is presently able to pay dividends in accordance with the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.
Events of Default
The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain customary events of default, such as failure to pay, breach of covenants, initiation of insolvency proceedings, material adverse effect and cross default provisions. Events of default also include certain breaches of the terms of the Concession Agreement, and the taking of certain formal measures or administrative intervention by the Macau government in respect of the Concession Agreement or the concession for the land on which Wynn Macau is located. The situations triggering an event of default related to WRLs ownership and control of WRM under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities have been amended and limited to the situation where Wynn Resorts, Limited ceases to own or control at least 51% of WRM (or ceases to have the ability to direct the management of WRM) pursuant to consent obtained from the relevant parties on 22 August 2011.
Security and Guarantees
Collateral for the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities consists of substantially all of the assets of WRM. Certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries have executed guarantees and pledged their interests in WRM in support of the obligations under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities. With respect to the Concession Agreement, the WRM lenders do have certain cure rights and consultation rights with the Macau government upon an enforcement by the lenders.
Second Ranking Lender
WRM is also party to a bank guarantee reimbursement agreement with Banco National Ultramarino S.A. to secure a guarantee in favor of the Macau government as required under the Concession Agreement. The amount of this guarantee is MOP300 million (approximately HK$291.3 million)
 
 
33
 
 
and it lasts until 180 days after the end of the term of the Concession Agreement. The guarantee assures WRMs performance under the Concession Agreement, including the payment of certain premiums, fines and indemnities for breach. The guarantee is secured by a second priority security interest in the same collateral package securing the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and conditions, such as inflation, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates.
Foreign Exchange Risks
The financial statements of foreign operations are translated into Hong Kong dollars, the Groups functional and presentation currency, for incorporation into the condensed consolidated financial information. The majority of our assets and liabilities are denominated in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Macau patacas and Offshore RMB, and there are no significant assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies. Assets and liabilities are translated at the prevailing foreign exchange rates in effect at the end of the reporting period. Income, expenditures and cash flow items are measured at the actual foreign exchange rates or average foreign exchange rates for the period. The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years. The Macau pataca is pegged to the Hong Kong dollar, and in many cases the two currencies are used interchangeably in Macau. However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca, and the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to, among other things, changes in governmental policies and international economic and political developments. In particular, our Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising primarily with respect to the Offshore RMB, which does not have pegged exchange linkages to the U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar or Macau pataca.
Interest Rate Risks
One of our primary exposures to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our credit facilities, which bear interest based on floating rates. We attempt to manage interest rate risk by managing the mix of long-term fixed rate borrowings and variable rate borrowings supplemented by hedging activities as considered necessary. We cannot assure you that these risk management strategies will have the desired effect, and interest rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
As at 30 June 2011, the Group had three interest rate swaps intended to manage a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities. Under the first swap agreement, the Group pays a fixed interest rate of 3.63% on U.S. dollar borrowings of approximately US$153.8 million (approximately HK$1.2 billion) incurred under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities in exchange for receipts on the same amount at a variable interest rate based on the applicable LIBOR at the time of payment. Under the second swap agreement, the Group pays a fixed interest rate of 3.39% on Hong Kong dollar borrowings of approximately HK$991.6 million incurred under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities in exchange for receipts on the same amount
 
 
34
 
 
at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. Based on the applicable margin of the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, as at 30 June 2010, these interest rate swaps fix the interest rates on the U.S. dollar and the Hong Kong dollar borrowings at approximately 4.88% to 5.38% and 4.64%, respectively. Both agreements terminate at the end of August 2011.
Under the third swap agreement, the Group pays a fixed interest rate of 2.15% on borrowings of approximately HK$2.3 billion incurred under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities in exchange for receipts on the same amount at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. As at 30 June 2011, this interest rate swap fixes the interest rate on HK$2.3 billion of borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities at approximately 3.40%. This interest rate swap agreement will terminate in June 2012.
The carrying values of these interest rate swaps on the condensed consolidated statement of financial position approximates their fair values. The fair value approximates the amount the Group would pay if these contracts were settled at the respective valuation dates. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions and, therefore, is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods. We adjust this amount by applying a non-performance valuation, considering our creditworthiness or the creditworthiness of our counterparties at each settlement date, as applicable. These transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting. Accordingly, changes in the fair values during the six months ended 30 June 2011 and 2010, were charged to the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Our liabilities under the swap agreements are secured by the same collateral package securing the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.
OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor do we engage in any transactions involving derivatives except for interest rate swaps. We do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity.
OTHER LIQUIDITY MATTERS
We expect to fund our operations and capital expenditure requirements from operating cash flows, cash on hand and availability under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities. However, we cannot be sure that operating cash flows will be sufficient for those purposes. We may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot be sure that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all.
New business developments (including our development of a project in Cotai) or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. There can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity. Any other development would require us to obtain additional financing.
 
 
35
 
 
In the ordinary course of business, in response to market demands and client preferences, and in order to increase revenues, we have made and will continue to make enhancements and refinements to our resort. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital expenditures related to these enhancements and refinements.
Taking into consideration our financial resources, including our cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and availability under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, we believe that we have sufficient liquid assets to meet our working capital and operating requirements for the following 12 months.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
For details of the related party transactions, see note 13 to the Interim Financial Information. Our Directors confirm that all related party transactions are conducted on normal commercial terms, and that their terms are fair and reasonable.
PURCHASE, SALE OR REDEMPTION OF COMPANYS LISTED SECURITIES
Neither the Company, nor any of its subsidiaries purchased, sold or redeemed any of the Companys shares during the six months ended 30 June 2011.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
The Company is dedicated to maintaining and ensuring high standards of corporate governance practices and the corporate governance principles of the Company are adopted in the best interest of the Company and its Shareholders. The Companys corporate governance practices are based on the principles, code provisions and certain recommended best practices as set out in the Code on Corporate Governance Practices contained in Appendix 14 of the Listing Rules.
The Company has complied with the code provisions in the Code (to the extent that such provisions are applicable) since the Listing, except for the following deviations from code provision A.2.1 of the Code.
The Board notes that on 24 February 2011, Dr. Allan Zeman disposed of 10,000 shares in the common stock of Wynn Resorts, Limited on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation Global Select Market at US$120 per share. The relevant notice to the Company and the Securities and Futures Commission, which is available to the public, disclosing this event was filed on 28 February 2011.
Stephen A. Wynn as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Under code provision A.2.1 of the Code, the roles of chairman and chief executive officer should be separate and should not be performed by the same individual. The Company does not at present separate the roles of the chairman and chief executive officer.
 
 
36
 
 
Mr. Wynn, the founder of the Company and Wynn Macau, serves as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The Board has determined that the combination of these roles held singularly by Mr. Wynn is in the best interest of the Company and all Shareholders. The Board believes that the issue of whether to combine or separate the offices of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer is part of the succession planning process and that it is in the best interests of the Company for the Board to make a determination whether to combine or separate the roles based upon the circumstances. The Board has given careful consideration to separating the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and has determined that the Company and its Shareholders are best served by the current structure. Mr. Wynns combined role promotes unified leadership and direction for the Board and executive management and allows for a single, clear focus for the Companys operational and strategic efforts.
The combined role of Mr. Wynn as both Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is balanced by the Companys governance structure, policies and controls. All major decisions are made in consultation with members of the Board and the relevant Board committees. The Company has three Board committees, namely the Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee, and Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee. Each Board committee comprises non-executive Directors only and is chaired by an independent non-executive Director. In addition, there are three independent non-executive Directors on the Board offering independent perspectives. This structure encourages independent and effective oversight of the Companys operations and prudent management of risk.
For the reasons stated above and as a result of the structure, policies and procedures outlined above, and in light of the historical success of Mr. Wynns leadership, the Board has concluded that the current Board leadership structure is in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders.
