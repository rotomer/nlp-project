Management Discussion and Analysis
OVERVIEW

In December 2007 and November 2009, Wynn Macau completed expansions, adding more gaming space and additional food and beverage and retail amenities. Encore at Wynn Macau, a further expansion of Wynn Macau that adds a fully integrated resort hotel, opened on 21 April 2010.
Our Macau resort complex features:
Approximately 265,000 square feet of casino space, offering 24-hour gaming and a full range of games, including private gaming salons, sky casinos and a poker area;
Two luxury hotel towers with a total of 1,009 spacious rooms and suites;

Management Discussion and Analysis
Cotai Development
The Group has applied to the government of Macau for a land concession on approximately 52 acres of land on Cotai and is awaiting fi nal government approval on the concession. Subsequent to government approval, we anticipate the construction of a full scale integrated resort containing a casino, approximately 1,500 rooms, convention, retail, entertainment and food and beverage offerings. We continue to fi nalize the project scope and budget.
Cotai Land Agreement
On 1 August 2008, Palo Real Estate Company Limited entered into an agreement with a Macau incorporated company that is not a connected person of the Group to make a one-time payment in the amount of US$50 million (approximately HK$389.3 million) in consideration of its relinquishment of certain rights in and to any future development on the approximately 52 acres of land on Cotai. The payment will be made within 15 days after the Macau government publishes the Group's rights to the land in the Macau government's offi cial gazette. The Group has fi led an application for the land with the Macau government and is awaiting fi nal approval.
Macau
Macau, which was a territory under Portuguese administration for approximately 450 years, was transferred from Portuguese to Chinese political control in December 1999. Macau is governed as a special administrative region of China and is located approximately 37 miles southwest of, and less than one hour away via ferry from, Hong Kong. Macau, which has been a casino destination for more than 40 years, consists principally of a peninsula on mainland China, and two neighboring islands, Taipa and Coloane. We believe that Macau is located in one of the world's largest concentrations of potential gaming customers. According to Macau Statistical Information, casinos in Macau generated approximately HK$120.5 billion in gaming revenue during the six months ended 30 June 2011, an increase of approximately 44.5% over the approximate HK$83.4 billion generated in the six months ended 30 June 2010, making Macau the largest gaming market in the world.
Macau's gaming market is primarily dependent on tourists. The Macau market has experienced tremendous growth in capacity in the last several years. As at 31 May 2011, there were 21,518 hotel rooms and as at 30 June 2011, there were 5,237 table games in Macau, compared to 12,978 hotel rooms and 2,760 table games as at 31 December 2006.
 
Interim Report 2011 7
Management Discussion and Analysis
FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Tourism
The levels of tourism and overall gaming activities in Macau are key drivers of our business. Both the Macau gaming market and visitation to Macau have grown signifi cantly in the last few years. We have benefi ted from the rise in visitation to Macau over the past several years.
Gaming customers traveling to Macau typically come from nearby destinations in Asia including mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore. According to the Macau Statistics and Census Service Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, approximately 89.1% of visitors to Macau in the six months ended 30 June 2011 were from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.
Tourism levels in Macau are affected by a number of factors, all of which are beyond our control. Key factors affecting tourism levels in Macau may include, among others:
 Prevailing economic conditions in mainland China and Asia;
 Various countries' policies on the issuance of travel visas that may be in place from time to time and could affect travel to Macau;
 Competition from other destinations which offer gaming and leisure activities;
 Possible changes to government restrictions on currency conversion or the ability to export currency from mainland China or other countries;
 Occurrence of natural disasters and disruption of travel; and
 Possible outbreaks of infectious disease.
Economic and Operating Environment
Our operating environment has remained stable during the six months ended 30 June 2011. However, economic conditions can have a signifi cant impact on our business. A number of factors, including a slowdown in the global economy, contracting credit markets, reduced consumer spending, various countries' policies that affect travel to Macau and any outbreak of infectious diseases can negatively impact the gaming industry in Macau and our business.
 
Management Discussion and Analysis
Competition
Since the liberalization of Macau's gaming industry in 2002, there has been a signifi cant increase in the number of gaming operators and casino properties in Macau. Currently, there are six gaming operators in Macau including WRM. The three concessionaires are WRM, SJM, and Galaxy which opened Galaxy Macau, a major resort in the Cotai area, on 15 May 2011. The three subconcessionaires are Melco Crown, MGM Macau, and Venetian Macau. As at 30 June 2011, there were approximately 34 casinos in Macau, including 20 operated by SJM. Each of the current six operators has operating casinos and expansion plans announced or underway.
Wynn Macau also faces competition from casinos primarily located in other areas of Asia, such as Resorts World Sentosa and Marina Bay Sands which opened in February and April 2010, respectively, in Singapore, Genting Highlands Resort located outside of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and casinos in the Philippines. Wynn Macau also encounters competition from other major gaming centers located around the world, including Australia and Las Vegas, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming, and other casinos throughout Asia. Further, if current efforts to legalize gaming in other Asian countries are successful, Wynn Macau will face additional regional competition.
Gaming Promoters
A signifi cant amount of our casino play is brought to us by gaming promoters. Gaming promoters have historically played a critical role in the Macau gaming market and are important to our casino business.
Gaming promoters introduce premium VIP players to Wynn Macau and often assist those clients with their travel and entertainment arrangements. In addition, gaming promoters often grant credit to their players. In exchange for their services, Wynn Macau generally pays the gaming promoters a percentage of the gross gaming win generated by each gaming promoter. Approximately 80% of these commissions are netted against casino revenues, because such commissions approximate the amount of the commission returned to the VIP players by the gaming promoters, and approximately 20% of these commissions are included in other operating expenses, which approximate the amount of the commission ultimately retained by the gaming promoters for their compensation. The total amount of commissions paid to these promoters and netted against casino revenues were HK$3.8 billion and HK$2.6 billion for the six months ended 30 June 2011 and 2010, respectively. Commissions increased 47.4% for the six months ended 30 June 2011 compared to the six months ended 30 June 2010, due to increased volumes of play generated by gaming promoters and the addition of two new gaming promoters. Additionally, gaming promoters each receive a monthly complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the turnover their clients generate.
 
Interim Report 2011 9
Management Discussion and Analysis
The allowance is available for room, food and beverage and other products and services for discretionary use with clients. We typically advance commissions to gaming promoters at the beginning of each month to facilitate their working capital requirements. These advances are provided to a gaming promoter and are offset by the commissions earned by such gaming promoter during the applicable month. The aggregate amounts of exposure to our gaming promoters, which is the difference between commissions advanced to each individual gaming promoter, and the commissions payable to each such gaming promoter, were HK$361.4 million and HK$61.2 million as at 30 June 2011 and 2010, respectively. These outstanding commissions were cleared no later than the fi fth day of the succeeding month and prior to the advancement of any further funds to a gaming promoter. We believe we have developed strong relationships with our gaming promoters. Our commission percentages have remained stable throughout our operating history.
Premium Credit Play
We selectively extend credit to players contingent upon our marketing team's knowledge of the players, their fi nancial background and payment history. We follow a series of credit procedures and require from each credit recipient various signed documents that are intended to ensure among other things that, if permitted by applicable law, the debt can be legally enforced in the jurisdiction where the player resides. In the event the player does not reside in a jurisdiction where gaming debts are legally enforceable, we often can assert jurisdiction over assets the player maintains in jurisdictions where gaming debts are recognized. In addition, we typically require a check in the amount of the applicable credit line from credit players, collateralizing the credit we grant to a player.
Number and Mix of Table Games and Slot Machines
The mix of VIP table games, mass table games and slot machines in operation at our resort changes from time to time as a result of marketing and operating strategies in response to changing market demand and industry competition. The shift in the mix of our games will affect casino profi tability.

ADJUSTED EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before fi nance costs, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening costs, property charges and other, share-based payments, and other non-operating income/ (expense). Adjusted EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because our Directors believe that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Our Adjusted EBITDA presented herein also differs from the Adjusted EBITDA presented by Wynn Resorts, Limited for its Macau segment in its fi lings with the SEC, primarily due to the inclusion of royalty fees, adjustments for IFRS differences with U.S. GAAP, corporate support services and other support services in arriving at operating profi t.
The following table sets forth a quantitative reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable IFRS measurement, operating profi t, for the six months ended 30 June 2011 and 2010.

Total casino revenues do not equal the sum of "VIP gross table games win," "mass market gross table games win" and "slot machine win" because gross table games win is calculated before commissions and discounts, and only recorded as revenues after the relevant commissions and discounts have been deducted.

In addition, the total table games win fi gures used herein do not correspond to casino revenues fi gures in our fi nancial information, because fi gures in our fi nancial information are calculated net of commissions and discounts and the total table games win herein is calculated before commissions and discounts.
Discussion of Results of Operations
Financial results for the six months ended 30 June 2011 compared to fi nancial results for the six months ended 30 June 2010
Our results of operations for the periods presented are not comparable as the six months ended 30 June 2011 include the operations of Encore for the full period whereas the six months ended 30 June 2010 only included the operations of Encore from its opening on 21 April 2010 through 30 June 2010.
 
14 Wynn Macau, Limited
Management Discussion and Analysis
Operating Revenues
Total operating revenues increased by 41.4% from HK$10.1 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$14.3 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2011. We believe this increase was due to a combination of factors, including increased visitation and overall gaming volumes in Macau during the fi rst half of 2011, as well as the opening of Encore on 21 April 2010.
Casino Revenues
Casino revenues increased by 42.0%, from HK$9.5 billion (93.8% of total operating revenues) in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$13.5 billion (94.2% of total operating revenues) in the six months ended 30 June 2011. The components and reasons are as follows:
VIP casino gaming operations. VIP gross table games win increased by 39.4%, from HK$9.7 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$13.5 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2011. VIP table games turnover increased by 48.1%, from HK$325.6 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$482.1 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2011. VIP gross table games win as a percentage of turnover (calculated before discounts and commissions) was 2.97% in the six months ended 30 June 2010 compared to 2.80% in the six months ended 30 June 2011 (win percentages are within the expected range of 2.7% to 3.0%). On 21 April 2010, we added 37 VIP tables with the opening of Encore which helped drive some of the growth in our VIP segment during the six months ended 30 June 2011 compared to the prior year.
Mass market casino gaming operations. Mass market gross table games win increased by 57.9%, from HK$1.9 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$3.0 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2011. Mass market table games drop increased by 27.8%, from HK$8.4 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$10.7 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2011. The mass market gross table games win percentage (calculated before discounts) was 22.5% in the six months ended 30 June 2010 compared to 27.8% in the six months ended 30 June 2011, which was within the expected win percentage range of 26% to 28%. We have increased our expected mass market range to 26%-28% based on our experience since the opening of Encore.
Slot machine gaming operations. Slot machine win increased by 52.9% from HK$753.2 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$1.2 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2011. Slot machine handle increased by 49.5%, from HK$15.5 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$23.1 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2011. The increases resulted primarily from increased visitation to our resort and the opening of Encore in April 2010. Consequently, total gross slot win increased and slot machine win per unit per day increased by 75.9% from HK$3,526 in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$6,202 in the six months ended 30 June 2011.
 
Interim Report 2011 15
Management Discussion and Analysis
Non-casino Revenues
Net non-casino revenues, which include rooms, food and beverage and retail and other revenues, increased by 31.6%, from HK$629.1 million (6.2% of total operating revenues) in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$827.8 million (5.8% of total operating revenues) in the six months ended 30 June 2011. The increase in revenues was largely due to stronger retail sales in the six months ended 30 June 2011 and the opening of Encore in April 2010.
Room. Our room revenues, which exclude promotional allowances in our condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income, increased by 15.5% from HK$57.0 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$65.9 million in the six months ended 30 June 2011. The increase is due to the 414 additional suites added with the addition of Encore in April 2010 and the increase in average daily room rate and occupancy rate compared to the prior year.
Management also evaluates room revenues on an adjusted basis which include promotional allowances. Adjusted room revenues including promotional allowances increased by 52.6% from HK$287.5 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$438.7 million in the six months ended 30 June 2011.

Management Discussion and Analysis
Food and beverage. Food and beverage revenues, which exclude promotional allowances in our condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income, totaled HK$94.2 million in the six months ended 30 June 2011, a 23.9% increase from the six months ended 30 June 2010 revenues of HK$76.0 million. The increase refl ects higher business volumes and the opening of Encore in April 2010.
Management also evaluates food and beverage revenues on an adjusted basis including promotional allowances. Food and beverage revenues in the six months ended 30 June 2011, adjusted to include these promotional allowances were HK$346.5 million, a 40.5% increase from the six months ended 30 June 2010 adjusted revenues of HK$246.6 million refl ecting the increase in business volumes and the opening of Encore in April 2010.
Retail and other. Our retail and other revenues, which exclude promotional allowances in our condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income, increased by 34.6%, from HK$496.0 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$667.7 million in the six months ended 30 June 2011. The increase was due primarily to increased same-store sales and new outlets at Encore including Chanel, Piaget and Cartier.
Management also evaluates retail and other revenues on an adjusted basis which includes promotional allowances. Adjusted retail and other revenues including promotional allowances increased by 36.0% from HK$503.2 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$684.1 million in the six months ended 30 June 2011, refl ecting the increased same-store sales and the new outlets at Encore.
Operating Costs and Expenses
Gaming taxes and premiums. Gaming taxes and premiums increased by 42.5%, from HK$4.9 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$7.0 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2011. This increase was due to increased gross gaming win from the six months ended 30 June 2011 compared to the six months ended 30 June 2010. Wynn Macau is subject to a 35% gaming tax on gross gaming win. In addition, Wynn Macau is also required to pay 4% of its gross gaming win as contributions for public development and social facilities.
Staff costs. Staff costs increased by 16.7%, from HK$879.2 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$1,026.1 million in the six months ended 30 June 2011. The increase was primarily due to the hiring of additional staff for Encore.

Management Discussion and Analysis
Other operating expenses. Other operating expenses increased by 34.0%, from HK$1.8 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$2.5 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2011. The increase in other operating costs was primarily due to the opening of Encore.
Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased by 21.4% from HK$445.4 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$540.6 million in the six months ended 30 June 2011. This increase was primarily due to the impact of assets placed in service with the opening of Encore in April 2010.
Property charges and other. Property charges and other increased from HK$22.9 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$849.3 million in the six months ended 30 June 2011. Included in property charges and other for the six months ended 30 June 2011 is a charge of HK$831.1 million refl ecting the present value of a charitable contribution made by WRM to the University of Macau Development Foundation. This contribution consists of a MOP200.0 million (approximately HK$194.2 million) payment made in May 2011, and a commitment for additional donations of MOP80.0 million (approximately HK$77.7 million) each year for the calendar years 2012 through 2022 inclusive, for a total of MOP1,080.0 million (approximately HK$1,048.5 million). The amount refl ected in our accompanying condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income has been discounted using our current estimated borrowing rate over the time period of the remaining committed payments. Other charges in each period represent gain/loss on the sale of equipment as well as costs related to assets retired or abandoned as a result of renovating certain assets of Wynn Macau in response to customer preferences and changes in market demand.
As a result of the foregoing, total operating costs and expenses increased by 46.7%, from HK$8.1 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$11.9 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2011.
Finance Revenues
Finance revenues increased from HK$0.3 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$9.9 million in the six months ended 30 June 2011. During 2011 and 2010, our short-term investment strategy has been to preserve capital while retaining suffi cient liquidity. While we have recently invested in certain corporate debt securities which contributed to the increase in interest income, the majority of our short-term investments are primarily in time deposits with a maturity of three months or less.

Finance Costs
Finance costs increased by 26.9%, from HK$107.1 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$135.9 million in the six months ended 30 June 2011. Finance costs increased in the six months ended 30 June 2011 primarily due to the reduction in capitalized interest for Encore which opened in April 2010, offset in part by the reduction in amounts outstanding under the revolver component of the Wynn Macau Credit Facility and lower interest rates in 2011 compared to 2010.
Interest Rate Swaps
As required under the terms of our various credit facilities, we have entered into agreements which swap a portion of the interest on our loans from fl oating to fi xed rates. These transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as an increase or decrease in swap fair value during each period. We recorded a gain of HK$46.7 million for the six months ended 30 June 2011 resulting from the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps in the six months ended 30 June 2011. We recorded an expense of HK$5.6 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010 resulting from the decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swaps in the six months ended 30 June 2010.
Income Tax Expense
For the six months ended 30 June 2011, our income tax expense was HK$3.5 million compared to an income tax expense of HK$36.1 million in the six months ended 30 June 2010. Our current tax expense for the six months ended 30 June 2011 primarily relates to the current tax expense of our subsidiaries owning WRM's shares under the WRM Shareholder Dividend Tax Agreement. In the six months ended 30 June 2010, our income tax expense mainly related to the amount accrued for the WRM Shareholder Dividend Tax Agreement and a deferred tax expense recorded by WRM resulting from derecognizing certain deferred tax assets.
Net Profi t Attributable to Owners of the Company
As a result of the foregoing, net profi t attributable to owners of the Company increased by 26.5%, from HK$1.9 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2010 to HK$2.4 billion in the six months ended 30 June 2011.

Wynn Macau Credit Facilities
Overview
As at 30 June 2011, WRM's credit facilities consisted of HK$12.0 billion in a combination of Hong Kong dollar and U.S. dollar facilities, including a HK$4.3 billion fully funded senior term loan facility and a HK$7.7 billion senior revolving credit facility. The facilities may be used for a variety of purposes, including further enhancements at our resort, investments in other projects in Macau and general corporate purposes.
We have the ability to increase secured debt under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities by up to an additional US$50 million (approximately HK$389.3 million).
As at 30 June 2011, we had total bank and other borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities of HK$4.3 billion, of which HK$1.2 billion was denominated in U.S. dollars and HK$3.1 billion was denominated in Hong Kong dollars.
In July 2009, as part of the Group Reorganization, WRM requested and obtained from its syndicate lenders under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities certain consents necessary to permit the Group Reorganization. As a result, WM Cayman Holdings Limited II became the highest level obligor, guarantor and chargor under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities and Wynn Group Asia, Inc. ceased to be an obligor, guarantor or chargor under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.
The Company is not a party to the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities and has no rights or obligations thereunder.
Principal and Interest
The term loans under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities mature in June 2014, and the revolving loans under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities mature in June 2012. The principal amount of the term loans is required to be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing in September 2011. Borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities bore interest at LIBOR or HIBOR plus a margin of 1.75%, through 30 September 2010. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2010, the revolving loans, the hotel facility of the term loan and tranches A and B of the project facility of the term loan are subject to a margin of 1.25% to 2.00% depending on the Group's leverage ratio at the end of each quarter. Tranche C of the project facility of the term loan remains subject to a margin of 1.75%. As at 30 June 2011, the weighted average margin is 1.29%.

Management Discussion and Analysis
General Covenants
The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain customary covenants restricting certain activities of the obligor group (WM Cayman Holdings Limited II and all of its subsidiaries except Palo Real Estate Company Limited), which does not include the Company, including, but not limited to, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the incurrence or creation of liens on property, sale and leaseback transactions, the ability to dispose of assets and the making of loans or certain other investments, entering into mergers, consolidations, liquidations or amalgamations, forming or acquiring subsidiaries, amending, modifying or terminating certain material contracts, permits and governing documents, entering into certain transactions with affi liates, changing fi scal periods, entering into business activities other than certain permitted activities, and selling or discounting receivables, in each case, subject to certain permitted exceptions.
Financial Covenants
The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities fi nancial covenants require WRM to maintain a Leverage Ratio, as defi ned in the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, of not greater than 3.75 to 1 as at 30 June 2011, and an Interest Coverage Ratio, as defi ned in the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, of not less than 2 to 1. Management believes that the Group was in compliance with all covenants as at 30 June 2011. Going forward, the Group is required to maintain a Leverage Ratio not greater than 3.75 to 1 for the quarterly reporting period ending 30 September 2011 and 3.50 to 1 for the quarterly reporting period ending 31 December 2011. The Interest Coverage Ratio requirement remains at not less than 2 to 1 for all 2011 reporting periods.
Compliance with Covenants
The Directors confi rm that there is no material non-compliance with the fi nancial covenants or general covenants contained in the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.
Mandatory Prepayment
The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain mandatory prepayment provisions, which include, among other matters, prepayment of 50% of Excess Cash Flow, as defi ned in the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, if WRM's Leverage Ratio is greater than 4 to 1 for any reporting period. For the six months ended 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2010, the Excess Cash Flow prepayment did not apply as WRM's Leverage Ratio was not in excess of 4 to 1 for either period.
 
Interim Report 2011 25
Management Discussion and Analysis
Dividend Restrictions
WRM and certain of its affi liates are subject to restrictions on payment of dividends or distributions or other amounts to their shareholders or to other affi liates, unless certain fi nancial and non-fi nancial criteria have been satisfi ed. Provided certain conditions are met, WRM is permitted to pay dividends. The conditions to be satisfi ed for the payment of dividends include:
Compliance with applicable legal requirements;
No event of default occurring under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities;
Compliance with the applicable fi nancial covenants; and
Such dividends may be made once in each fi scal quarter (and in respect of the fi rst fi scal quarter in a fi scal year, only after borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities have been prepaid to the extent required by the application of the excess cash fl ow mandatory prepayment provisions).
WRM is currently in compliance with all requirements, namely satisfaction of its Leverage Ratio, which must be met in order to pay dividends and is presently able to pay dividends in accordance with the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.
Events of Default
The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain customary events of default, such as failure to pay, breach of covenants, initiation of insolvency proceedings, material adverse effect and cross default provisions. Events of default also include certain breaches of the terms of the Concession Agreement, and the taking of certain formal measures or administrative intervention by the Macau government in respect of the Concession Agreement or the concession for the land on which Wynn Macau is located. The situations triggering an event of default related to WRL's ownership and control of WRM under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities have been amended and limited to the situation where Wynn Resorts, Limited ceases to own or control at least 51% of WRM (or ceases to have the ability to direct the management of WRM) pursuant to consent obtained from the relevant parties on 22 August 2011.
Security and Guarantees
Collateral for the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities consists of substantially all of the assets of WRM. Certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries have executed guarantees and pledged their interests in WRM in support of the obligations under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities. With respect to the Concession Agreement, the WRM lenders do have certain cure rights and consultation rights with the Macau government upon an enforcement by the lenders.

Management Discussion and Analysis
Second Ranking Lender
WRM is also party to a bank guarantee reimbursement agreement with Banco National Ultramarino S.A. to secure a guarantee in favor of the Macau government as required under the Concession Agreement. The amount of this guarantee is MOP300 million (approximately HK$291.3 million) and it lasts until 180 days after the end of the term of the Concession Agreement. The guarantee assures WRM's performance under the Concession Agreement, including the payment of certain premiums, fi nes and indemnities for breach. The guarantee is secured by a second priority security interest in the same collateral package securing the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and conditions, such as infl ation, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates.
Foreign Exchange Risks
The fi nancial statements of foreign operations are translated into Hong Kong dollars, the Group's functional and presentation currency, for incorporation into the condensed consolidated fi nancial information. The majority of our assets and liabilities are denominated in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Macau patacas and Offshore RMB, and there are no signifi cant assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies. Assets and liabilities are translated at the prevailing foreign exchange rates in effect at the end of the reporting period. Income, expenditures and cash fl ow items are measured at the actual foreign exchange rates or average foreign exchange rates for the period. The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years. The Macau pataca is pegged to the Hong Kong dollar, and in many cases the two currencies are used interchangeably in Macau. However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca, and the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to, among other things, changes in governmental policies and international economic and political developments. In particular, our Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising primarily with respect to the Offshore RMB, which does not have pegged exchange linkages to the U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar or Macau pataca.
 
Interim Report 2011 27
Management Discussion and Analysis
Interest Rate Risks
One of our primary exposures to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our credit facilities, which bear interest based on fl oating rates. We attempt to manage interest rate risk by managing the mix of long-term fi xed rate borrowings and variable rate borrowings supplemented by hedging activities as considered necessary. We cannot assure you that these risk management strategies will have the desired effect, and interest rate fl uctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
As at 30 June 2011, the Group had three interest rate swaps intended to manage a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities. Under the fi rst swap agreement, the Group pays a fi xed interest rate of 3.63% on U.S. dollar borrowings of approximately US$153.8 million (approximately HK$1.2 billion) incurred under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities in exchange for receipts on the same amount at a variable interest rate based on the applicable LIBOR at the time of payment. Under the second swap agreement, the Group pays a fi xed interest rate of 3.39% on Hong Kong dollar borrowings of approximately HK$991.6 million incurred under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities in exchange for receipts on the same amount at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. Based on the applicable margin of the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, as at 30 June 2011, these interest rate swaps fi x the interest rates on the U.S. dollar and the Hong Kong dollar borrowings at approximately 4.88% to 5.38% and 4.64%, respectively. Both agreements terminate at the end of August 2011.
Under the third swap agreement, the Group pays a fi xed interest rate of 2.15% on borrowings of approximately HK$2.3 billion incurred under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities in exchange for receipts on the same amount at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. As at 30 June 2011, this interest rate swap fi xes the interest rate on HK$2.3 billion of borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities at approximately 3.40%. This interest rate swap agreement will terminate in June 2012.
 
28 Wynn Macau, Limited
Management Discussion and Analysis
The carrying values of these interest rate swaps on the condensed consolidated statement of fi nancial position approximates their fair values. The fair value approximates the amount the Group would pay if these contracts were settled at the respective valuation dates. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions and, therefore, is subject to signifi cant estimation and a high degree of variability of fl uctuation between periods. We adjust this amount by applying a non-performance valuation, considering our creditworthiness or the creditworthiness of our counterparties at each settlement date, as applicable. These transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting. Accordingly, changes in the fair values during the six months ended 30 June 2011 and 2010, were charged to the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Our liabilities under the swap agreements are secured by the same collateral package securing the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.
OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor do we engage in any transactions involving derivatives except for interest rate swaps. We do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity.
OTHER LIQUIDITY MATTERS
We expect to fund our operations and capital expenditure requirements from operating cash fl ows, cash on hand and availability under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities. However, we cannot be sure that operating cash fl ows will be suffi cient for those purposes. We may refi nance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot be sure that we will be able to refi nance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all.
New business developments (including our development of a project in Cotai) or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. There can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity. Any other development would require us to obtain additional fi nancing.
 
Interim Report 2011 29
Management Discussion and Analysis
In the ordinary course of business, in response to market demands and client preferences, and in order to increase revenues, we have made and will continue to make enhancements and refi nements to our resort. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital expenditures related to these enhancements and refi nements.
Taking into consideration our fi nancial resources, including our cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and availability under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, we believe that we have suffi cient liquid assets to meet our working capital and operating requirements for the following 12 months.

Interim Report 2011 45
Other Information
The Company has complied with the code provisions in the Code on Corporate Governance Practices for the six months ended 30 June 2011, except for the following deviation from provision A.2.1 of the Code on Corporate Governance Practices.
The Board notes that on 24 February 2011, Dr. Allan Zeman disposed of 10,000 shares in the common stock of Wynn Resorts, Limited on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation Global Select Market at US$120 per share. The relevant notice to the Company and the Securities and Futures Commission, which is available to the public, disclosing this event was fi led on 28 February 2011.
Stephen A. Wynn as our Chairman and Chief Executive Offi cer
Under code provision A.2.1 of the Code, the roles of chairman and chief executive offi cer should be separate and should not be performed by the same individual. The Company does not at present separate the roles of the chairman and chief executive offi cer.
Mr. Wynn, the founder of the Company and Wynn Macau, serves as the Chairman and Chief Executive Offi cer of the Company. The Board has determined that the combination of these roles held singularly by Mr. Wynn is in the best interest of the Company and all Shareholders. The Board believes that the issue of whether to combine or separate the offi ces of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Offi cer is part of the succession planning process and that it is in the best interests of the Company for the Board to make a determination whether to combine or separate the roles based upon the circumstances. The Board has given careful consideration to separating the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Offi cer and has determined that the Company and its Shareholders are best served by the current structure. Mr. Wynn's combined role promotes unifi ed leadership and direction for the Board and executive management and allows for a single, clear focus for the Company's operational and strategic efforts.
The combined role of Mr. Wynn as both Chairman and Chief Executive Offi cer is balanced by the Company's governance structure, policies and controls. All major decisions are made in consultation with members of the Board and the relevant Board committees. The Company has three Board committees, namely the audit committee, remuneration committee, and nomination and corporate governance committee. Each Board committee comprises non-executive Directors only and is chaired by an independent non-executive Director. In addition, there are three independent non-executive Directors on the Board offering independent perspectives.
This structure encourages independent and effective oversight of the Company's operations and prudent management of risk.

Other Information

(Incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability)
INTRODUCTION
We have reviewed the interim fi nancial information set out on pages 51 to 76 which comprises the condensed consolidated statement of fi nancial position of Wynn Macau, Limited as at 30 June 2011 and the related condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash fl ows for the six-month period then ended, and explanatory information. The Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited require the preparation of a report on interim fi nancial information to be in compliance with the relevant provisions thereof and International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting ("IAS 34").
The directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of this interim fi nancial information in accordance with IAS 34. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on this interim fi nancial information based on our review. Our report is made solely to you, as a body, in accordance with our agreed terms of engagement, and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the contents of this report.
SCOPE OF REVIEW
We conducted our review in accordance with Hong Kong Standard on Review Engagements 2410
Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certifi ed Public Accountants. A review of interim fi nancial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for fi nancial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Hong Kong Standards on Auditing. Consequently, it does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all signifi cant matters that might be identifi ed in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

Report on Review of Interim Financial Information
CONCLUSION
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim fi nancial information is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued)
Held-to-maturity investments
Non-derivative fi nancial assets with fi xed or determinable payments and fi xed maturity are classifi ed as held to maturity when the Group has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are initially recognized on the settlement date and are subsequently measured at amortized cost less any allowance for impairment. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate amortization is included in fi nance revenues in the statement of comprehensive income. The loss arising from impairment is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in other operating expenses.
Reclassifi cations
Certain amounts in the interim fi nancial information for the six months ended 30 June 2010 have been reclassifi ed to be consistent with the current period's presentation. These reclassifi cations have no effect on the previously reported profi t for the prior period.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE (continued)
No provision for Hong Kong profi t tax for the six months ended 30 June 2011 has been made as there was no assessable profi t generated in Hong Kong (six months ended 30 June 2010: Nil). Taxation for overseas jurisdictions is charged at the appropriate prevailing rates ruling in the respective jurisdictions and the maximum rate is 12% (six months ended 30 June 2010: 12%). For the six months ended 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2010, the current tax provision of HK$3.5 million results from the current income tax expense accrued by our subsidiaries owning
WRM's shares under the WRM Shareholder Dividend Tax Agreement. For the six months ended 30 June 2011, WRM did not recognize a deferred income tax benefi t for increases in deferred tax assets due to uncertainty regarding future realization. For the six months ended 30 June 2010, WRM recorded a deferred income tax provision of HK$32.6 million as the result of derecognizing certain deferred tax assets. Effective 6 September 2006, WRM received a 5-year exemption from Macau's 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profi ts. On 30 November 2010, WRM received an additional 5-year exemption effective from 1 January 2011 through 31 December 2015. Accordingly, the Group was exempted from the payment of approximately HK$267.5 million in such tax for the six months ended 30 June 2011 (six months ended 30 June 2010: HK$215.6 million). The Group's non-gaming profi ts remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and its casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming Tax and other levies in accordance with its Concession Agreement.
In June 2009, WRM entered into an agreement with the Macau Special Administrative Region that provided for an annual payment of MOP7.2 million (approximately HK$7.0 million) to the Macau Special Administrative Region as a payment in lieu of Complementary Tax otherwise due by the WRM shareholders on dividend distributions from gaming profi ts. This agreement covered dividend distributions of gaming profi t earned in the years 2006 through 2010. On 3
November 2010, WRM applied for a 5-year extension of this agreement for the years ending 31 December 2011 through 2015. On 19 July 2011, WRM received notifi cation that the 5-year extension had been ratifi ed and that an annual payment of MOP15.5 million (approximately HK$15.0 million) would be due to the Macau Special Administrative Region for each of the years 2011 through 2015.
The Group is exempted from income tax in the Isle of Man and the Cayman Islands. The Group's subsidiaries fi le income tax returns in Macau and various foreign jurisdictions as required by law. The Group's income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in the locations where it operates. The Group's 2006 to 2010 Macau income tax returns remain subject to examination by the Macau Finance Bureau. During the six months ended 30 June 2011, the Group received the results of the Macau Finance Bureau's examination of its 2006 and 2007 Macau Complementary Tax returns. During July 2011, the Group fi led an appeal of the examinations fi ndings. The Group does not anticipate that the resolution of theses issues will result in signifi cant tax payments and believes that the tax reserves established for any uncertain tax issues is adequate with respect to these years.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE (continued)
Quarterly, the Group reviews any potentially unfavorable tax outcome and when an unfavorable outcome is identifi ed as being probable and can be reasonably estimated, the Group then establishes a tax reserve for such possible unfavorable outcome. Estimating potential tax outcomes for any uncertain tax issues is highly judgmental and may not be indicative of the ultimate settlement with the tax authorities. With respect to these items, as at 30 June 2011, the Group has provided a reserve of HK$41.9 million (31 December 2010: HK$41.9 million) and included this amount in "other long-term liabilities". The Group believes that it has adequately provided reasonable reserves for prudent and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters. As a result of the lack of authoritative guidance regarding the computation of the Group's Complementary Tax exemptions, the Group establishes reserves for its estimates of additional tax exposures if such exemptions are denied by the Macau tax authorities.

INTEREST-BEARING LOANS AND BORROWINGS (continued)
The WRM term loan matures in June 2014, and the WRM revolving credit facility matures in June 2012. The principal amount of the WRM term loan is required to be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing in September 2011. Borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities bore interest at LIBOR or HIBOR plus a margin of 1.75% through 30 September 2010. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2010, the WRM revolving credit facility, the WRM term loan hotel facility and the WRM term loan project facility tranches A (US$18,500,000) and B (HK$2,451,150,000) are subject to a margin of 1.25% to 2.00% depending on the Group's leverage ratio at the end of each quarter. The WRM term loan project facility tranche C (US$125,000,000) remains subject to a margin of 1.75%. As at 30 June 2011, the weighted average margin is 1.29%.
During the six months ended 30 June 2011, the Group repaid HK$779.5 million (six months ended 30 June 2010: HK$2.9 billion) of borrowings under the WRM revolving credit facility. As at 30 June 2011, the Group had approximately HK$7.7 billion (31 December 2010: HK$7.0 billion) available under the credit facilities.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Company's share option scheme
The Company established a share option scheme on 16 September 2009 with the purpose of rewarding participants, which may include Directors and employees of the Group, who have contributed to the Group and to encourage them to work towards enhancing the value of the Company and its Shares for the benefi t of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole. A maximum of 518.75 million shares (31 December 2010: 518.75 million shares) have been reserved for issuance under the share option scheme. For the six months ended 30 June 2011, 400,000 options (six months ended 30 June 2010: 1,000,000 options) were granted to certain Directors of the Company and 50,000 options were exercised (six months ended 30 June 2010: Nil). No options were lapsed or cancelled (six months ended 30 June 2010: Nil). As at 30 June 2011, 1,350,000 options (30 June 2010: 1,000,000 options) were outstanding.
The fair value of the options granted on 17 May 2011 was estimated at HK$5.866 per option based on the Black-Scholes valuation model. The signifi cant inputs used in the model were a share price of HK$24.35 on the date of grant, an exercise price of HK$25.96, an expected stock price volatility of 37.8%, an expected life of options of 6.5 years, an expected dividend yield of 4.1% and an annual risk-free interest rate of approximately 2.11%. Changes in the subjective input assumptions could materially affect the fair value estimate.

Royalty fees
Prior to Listing, WRM had an arrangement with Wynn Resorts, Limited and Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLC (together, the "Licensors") under which the Licensors licensed to WRM certain trademarks and service marks, other marks and works, domain names, and hotel casino design, development and management know-how (collectively, the "Intellectual Property Rights"). On 19 September 2009, each of the Company and WRM entered into an intellectual property license agreement with the Licensors (together, the "IP License Arrangement"), which has a perpetual term. Pursuant to the IP License Arrangement, the Licensors licensed to each of the Company and WRM the right to use the Intellectual Property Rights using the same pricing basis as described below. The IP License Arrangement is also subject to restrictions in the agreements between Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLC or Wynn Resorts, Limited and any third parties, including Mr. Stephen A. Wynn, in respect of a third party's intellectual property, including any applicable limitations on the scope of the license, limitations on sub-licensing, termination (including change of control) under certain circumstances and other standard provisions.
The license fee payable to Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLC equals the greater of (1) 3% of the IP gross monthly revenues, and (2) US$1.5 million (approximately HK$11.6 million) per month. For the purposes of each intellectual property license agreement, the term "IP gross revenues" refers to the licensee's total operating revenues as adjusted by adding back (1) commissions and discounts which were netted against operating revenues, and (2) promotional allowances, and the term "IP gross monthly revenues" refers to the licensee's IP gross revenues accrued at the end of each calendar month. The calculation of each licensee's operating revenues, promotional allowances, and commissions and discounts in connection with the IP gross revenues stated in the intellectual property license agreements shall always be consistent with the Group's accounting policies and prepared in accordance with IFRSs as in effect from 31 December 2008. If any other subsidiary of the Company (other than WRM) acquires the Intellectual Property Rights under the intellectual property license agreement between the Company and the Licensors, "IP gross revenues" and "IP monthly gross revenues" will be interpreted to include the gross revenues of such relevant subsidiary.
The following table presents a reconciliation of total operating revenues (as reported in the Group's interim fi nancial information) to WRM's IP gross revenues as used for purposes of the IP License Arrangement between WRM and the Licensors.
