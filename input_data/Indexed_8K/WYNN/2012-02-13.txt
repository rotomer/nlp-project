Item 8.01        Other Events
As previously disclosed, in May 2011, Wynn Macau, a majority owned subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, Limited (the Company), made a commitment to the University of Macau Development Foundation in support of the new Asia-Pacific Academy of Economics and Management.  This contribution consists of a $25 million payment made in May 2011 and a commitment for additional donations of $10 million each year for the calendar years 2012 through 2022 inclusive.  The pledge was consistent with the Companys long-standing practice of providing philanthropic support for deserving institutions in the markets in which it operates.  The pledge was made following an extensive analysis which concluded that the gift was made in accordance with all applicable laws.  The pledge was considered by the Boards of Directors of both the Company and Wynn Macau and approved by 15 of the 16 directors who serve on those boards.  The sole dissenting vote was Mr. Kazuo Okada whose stated objection was to the length of time over which the donation would occur, not its propriety.
Also as previously disclosed, Mr. Okada commenced litigation on January 11, 2012, in Nevada seeking to compel the Company to produce information relating to the donation to the University of Macau, among other things. 
On February 8, 2012, following Mr. Okadas lawsuit, the Company received a letter from the Salt Lake Regional Office of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") requesting that, in connection with an informal inquiry by the SEC, the Company preserve information relating to the donation to the University of Macau, any donations by the Company to any other educational charitable institutions, including the University of Macau Development Foundation, and the Companys casino or concession gaming licenses or renewals in Macau.  The Company intends to fully comply with the SECs request.
