Indenture for 5.375% First Mortgage Notes due 2022
On March 12, 2012, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC (the "Company") and Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp. ("Capital Corp." and, together with the Company, the "Issuers") issued $900,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.375% First Mortgage Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes") pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 12, 2012 (the "2022 Indenture"), among the Issuers, the Guarantors (as defined below) and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). The Company plans to use a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to repay all outstanding loans under its term loan facilities and to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes.
The 2022 Notes will mature on March 15, 2022 and bear interest at the rate of 5.375% per annum. The Issuers may redeem all or a portion of the 2022 Notes at any time on or after March 15, 2017, at a premium decreasing ratably to zero, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, prior to March 15, 2015, the Issuers may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes with the net proceeds of one or more qualified equity contributions made to the Issuers by their parent, Wynn Resorts, Limited. If the Issuers undergo a change of control, they must offer to repurchase the 2022 Notes at 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. If the Issuers sell certain assets or suffer an event of loss, and the Issuers do not use the sale or insurance proceeds for specified purposes, they must offer to repurchase the 2022 Notes at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 2022 Notes are also subject to mandatory redemption requirements imposed by gaming laws and regulations of gaming authorities in Nevada.
The 2022 Notes are the Issuers' senior secured obligations and rank pari passu in right of payment with borrowings under the Company's credit facilities and the Issuers' outstanding 7

The 2022 Notes are secured on an equal and ratable basis (with certain exceptions) by a first priority lien on substantially all of the Issuers' existing and future assets, and, subject to gaming approval, a first priority pledge of the Company's equity interests, all of which is the same collateral that secures borrowings under the Company's credit facilities and the Existing Notes. The first priority lien securing the 2022 Notes may be released in whole, or in part, under certain circumstances without the consent of the holders of the 2022 Notes.
The 2022 Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by all of the Issuers' subsidiaries except Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC (the "Guarantors"). The guarantees of the 2022 Notes are secured on an equal and ratable basis by a first priority lien on substantially all of the Guarantors' assets, the same collateral that secures the guarantees under the Company's credit facilities and the Existing Notes.
The 2022 Indenture contains covenants limiting the Issuers' and the Issuers' restricted subsidiaries' ability to: pay dividends or distributions or repurchase equity; incur additional debt; make investments; create liens on assets to secure debt; enter into transactions with affiliates; issue stock of, or member's interests in, subsidiaries; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; engage in other businesses; merge or consolidate with another company; transfer and sell assets;
issue disqualified stock; create dividend and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries; and designate restricted and unrestricted subsidiaries. These covenants are subject to a number of important and significant limitations, qualifications and exceptions.
Events of default under the 2022 Indenture include, among others, the following: default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on the 2022 Notes; default in payment when due of the principal of, or premium, if any, on the 2022 Notes; failure to comply with certain covenants in the 2022 Indenture; and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. In the case of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuers, any significant restricted subsidiary or any group of restricted subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a significant restricted subsidiary, all 2022 Notes then outstanding will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice.

The notice shall identify the Notes to be redeemed and shall state:
(a) the redemption date;
(b) the redemption price;

If a Note is redeemed or purchased on or after an interest record date but on or prior to the related interest payment date, then any accrued and unpaid interest shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Note was registered at the close of business on such record date. If any Note called for redemption or purchase is not so paid upon surrender for redemption or purchase because of the failure of the Issuers to comply with the preceding paragraph, interest shall be paid on the unpaid principal, from the redemption or purchase date until such principal is paid, and to the extent lawful on any interest not paid on such unpaid principal, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes and in Section 4.01 hereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.16, if the damaged Collateral is not necessary for and is not used in the operation of the Wynn Las Vegas Resort or Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, as the case may be, Wynn Las Vegas (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may apply the Net Loss Proceeds to make a capital expenditure, improve real property or acquire long-term assets that are used or useful in a line of business permitted by Section 4.13 hereof.
Any Net Loss Proceeds that are (1) not reinvested as provided in the first sentence of this Section 4.16 or (2) otherwise required, pursuant to the Credit Agreement, to be applied to reduce Indebtedness of Wynn Las Vegas, in each case, shall be deemed "." Within 10 days following the earlier of (i) the date on which the aggregate amount of Excess Loss Proceeds exceeds $10.0 million or (ii) the date when, pursuant to the Credit Agreement, Excess Loss Proceeds are required to be applied to reduce Indebtedness of Wynn Las Vegas, Wynn Las Vegas shall allocate a portion of such Excess Loss Proceeds determined by multiplying the amount of such Excess Loss Proceeds by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding and all Pari Passu Debt then outstanding, and the denominator of which is the total aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, all Pari Passu Debt then outstanding and all Indebtedness then outstanding under the Credit Agreement (such amount being the ""), to make an offer (an "") to all Holders of Notes and, to the extent required, the holders of such Pari Passu Debt to repurchase such Notes and such Pari Passu Debt at an offer price equal to 100% of the principal

amount of the Notes and such Pari Passu Debt to be purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, on the Notes and such other Pari Passu Debt to the date of repurchase, which offer price shall be payable in cash. The amount of any such Excess Loss Proceeds less the Event of Loss Offer Amount (the "") shall concurrently be applied to repay any term Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement in accordance with the requirements of the Credit Agreement; provided, however, that to the extent that the Event of Loss Repayment Amount exceeds the amount of term Indebtedness then outstanding under the Credit Agreement at the time of repayment but does not exceed $100.0 million (unless the lenders under the Credit Agreement have waived any requirement of Wynn Las Vegas to prepay revolving credit Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement and to effect a corresponding permanent reduction of the commitments thereunder), such excess amount (after repayment in full of the term Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement) shall be added to the Event of Loss Offer Amount and offered to the Holders of the Notes and, to the extent required, the holders of such Pari Passu Debt pursuant to the Event of Loss Offer as provided in the preceding sentence. If any Excess Loss Proceeds remain after consummation of an Event of Loss Offer and repayment of any term Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement, Wynn Las Vegas (or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may use those Excess Loss Proceeds for any general corporate purpose not prohibited by this Indenture, the Credit Agreement, the 2017 Notes, the 7

In the event of an Event of Loss pursuant to clause (3) of the definition of "Event of Loss" with respect to property or assets that have a Fair Market Value (or replacement cost, if greater) in excess of $500.0 million, Wynn Las Vegas (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) shall be required to receive consideration:
(a) at least equal to the Fair Market Value (evidenced by a resolution of Wynn Capital's Board of Directors set forth in an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee) of the property or assets subject to the Event of Loss; and
(b) at least 80% of which is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents.
The Issuers shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Event of Loss Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of Sections 3.10 or 4.16 of this Indenture, the Issuers shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations under those provisions of this Indenture by virtue of such compliance.
Section 4.17
Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries.
The Board of Directors of Wynn Capital may designate any Restricted Subsidiary, other than Wynn Capital, to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas if that designation would not cause a Default or an Event of Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by Wynn Las Vegas and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary properly designated shall be deemed to be an Investment made in an Unrestricted Subsidiary as of the time of the designation and shall reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under Section 4.07 hereof or Permitted Investments, as determined by Wynn Las Vegas. That designation shall only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas otherwise meets the definition of an "Unrestricted Subsidiary." The Board of Directors of Wynn Capital may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas to be a Restricted Subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas if the redesignation would not cause a Default or an Event of Default.
Any designation of a Subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas as an Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a certified copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors giving effect to such designation and an Officers' Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by Section 4.07 hereof. If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it shall thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of this Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under Section 4.09 hereof, Wynn Las Vegas shall be in default of such covenant. The Board of Directors of Wynn Capital may at any time redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas to be a Restricted Subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas; provided that such designation shall be deemed to be an incurrence of
 
Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation shall only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under Section 4.09 hereof, calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the four-quarter Reference Period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.

(b) the gross cash proceeds of such sale and leaseback transaction are at least equal to the Fair Market Value, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of Wynn Capital or that Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, and set forth in an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee, of the property that is the subject of such sale and leaseback transaction; and

(b) prepay any Management Fees.
Any Management Fees not permitted to be paid during a particular 12-month period pursuant to this Section 4.20 shall be deferred and shall accrue.

Section 6.02
Acceleration.
In the case of an Event of Default specified in clause (k) or (l) of Section 6.01 hereof, with respect to either Issuer, any Significant Restricted Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Restricted Subsidiary, all outstanding Notes shall become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately. Upon any such declaration, the Notes shall become due and payable immediately. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of all of the Holders rescind an acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default (except nonpayment of principal, interest or premium or Liquidated Damages, if any, that has become due solely because of the acceleration) have been cured or waived.
 
Section 6.03
Other Remedies.
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal, premium and Liquidated Damages, if any, and interest on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Notes or this Indenture.
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder of a Note in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.
Section 6.04
Waiver of Past Defaults.
Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes, waive an existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences hereunder, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes (including in connection with an offer to purchase); provided, however, that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 6.05
Control by Majority.
Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it. In addition, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture that the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders of Notes or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability.
Section 6.06
Limitation on Suits.
Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, interest, or premium, if any, or Liquidated Damages, if any, when due, a Holder of a Note may pursue a remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Notes only if:
(a) such Holder of a Note gives to the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;
(b) the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
 
(c) such Holder or Holders offer and, if requested, provide to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;
(d) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and
(e) during such 60-day period, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.
A Holder of a Note may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder of a Note or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder of a Note.
Section 6.07
Rights of Holders of Notes to Receive Payment.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder of a Note to receive payment of principal, premium and Liquidated Damages, if any, and interest on the Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Note (including in connection with an offer to purchase), or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder; provided that a Holder shall not have the right to institute any such suit for the enforcement of payment if and to the extent that the institution or prosecution thereof or the entry of judgment therein would, under applicable law, result in the surrender, impairment, waiver or loss of the Lien of this Indenture upon any property subject to such Lien.
Section 6.08
Collection Suit by Trustee.
If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(a) or (b) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Issuers for the whole amount of principal of, premium and Liquidated Damages, if any, and interest remaining unpaid on, the Notes and interest on overdue principal and, to the extent lawful, interest and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
Section 6.09
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders of the Notes allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Issuers (or any other obligor upon the Notes), its creditors or its property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and any custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under
 
Section 7.07 hereof. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties that the Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
Section 6.10

This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder of a Note pursuant to Section 6.07 hereof, or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes.

Neither the Issuers nor any Guarantor need pay for any settlement made without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Section 9.02
With Consent of Holders of Notes.
Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, the Issuers, the Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture (including, without limitation, Section 3.10, 4.10, 4.15 and 4.16 hereof), the Notes, the Note Guarantees and, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and this Indenture, the Collateral Documents, with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, Additional Notes, if any) voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and, subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, any existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium or Liquidated Damages, if any, or interest on the Notes, except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of this Indenture, the
 
Notes, the Note Guarantees or, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and this Indenture, the Collateral Documents, may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, Additional Notes, if any) voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with purchase of, or a tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes).
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the Collateral Documents, any amendment or modification to the definition of "Excluded Assets" in the Pledge and Security Agreement or the definition of "Excluded Property" in the Deeds of Trust shall require, in addition to the other consents required pursuant to Section 10.01(b) hereof and the Intercreditor Agreement, the consent of at least a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, Additional Notes, if any) voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consent obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), if as a result of such amendment or modification, the Notes will not be secured by substantially all of the assets of the Issuers and the Guarantors.

It is not necessary for the consent of the Holders of Notes under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it is sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 becomes effective, the Issuers shall mail to the Holders of Notes affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Issuers to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental indenture or waiver.

(e) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes;
(f) make any change in the provisions of this Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of, or interest or premium or Liquidated Damages, if any, on the Notes;
(g) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by Sections 3.10, 4.10, 4.15 and 4.16 hereof);
(h) release all or substantially all of the Collateral, in each case, except in accordance with the provisions of the Collateral Documents;

Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Notes shall be set forth in a amended or supplemental Indenture that complies with the TIA as then in effect.
Section 9.04
Revocation and Effect of Consents.
Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Note and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a Note may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the waiver, supplement or amendment becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.
 
Section 9.05
Notation on or Exchange of Notes.
The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment, supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter authenticated. The Issuers in exchange for all Notes may issue and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, authenticate new Notes that reflect the amendment, supplement or waiver.
Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.
Section 9.06
Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc.
The Trustee shall sign any amended or supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. The Issuers and the Guarantors may not sign an amendment or supplemental indenture until their respective Boards of Directors approve it. In executing any amended or supplemental indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and (subject to Section 7.01 hereof) shall be fully protected in relying upon, in addition to the documents required by Section 14.04 hereof, an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture.

Each Holder of Notes, by its acceptance thereof, consents and agrees to the terms of the Collateral Documents (including, without limitation, the provisions providing for foreclosure and release of Collateral and limitations on exercise of rights and remedies) as the same may be in effect or may be amended from time to time in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and the Collateral Documents and authorizes and directs the Trustee to enter into the Collateral Documents and to perform its obligations and exercise its rights thereunder in accordance therewith. The Issuers and Guarantors shall deliver to the Trustee copies of all documents delivered to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Collateral Documents and the Issuers shall do or cause to be done all such acts and things as may be necessary or proper, or as may be required by the provisions of the Collateral Documents, to assure and confirm to the Trustee the security interests in the Collateral contemplated hereby, by

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuers shall take, and shall cause the Restricted Subsidiaries that are party to one or more Collateral Documents to take, upon request of the Trustee, any and all actions reasonably required to cause the Collateral Documents to create and maintain, as security for the Obligations of the Issuers hereunder and of the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees, a valid and enforceable perfected Lien of the priority required by the Collateral Documents in and on all the Collateral, in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of Notes, superior to and prior to the rights of all third Persons, in each case, equal and ratable with the Liens securing the obligations under the Credit Agreement and subject to Permitted Liens and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors under this Indenture and the Notes are not secured by the deeds of trust entered into prior to the date hereof to secure the Credit Agreement, the 2017 Notes, the 7

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Holder by accepting a Note agrees that, as described in the Deeds of Trust and the Pledge and Security Agreement, each of the Deeds of Trust and Pledge and Security Agreement and any other document or instrument pursuant to which the Issuers or any Affiliate thereof from time to time grants a Lien to the Trustee or the Holders or an agent or representative on their behalf to secure their obligations hereunder (collectively, the "Security Documents") are "Shared Security Documents," and that the Trustee is authorized and directed by each Holder to treat and the Trustee and each such Holder agrees that it will treat the same as "Shared Security Documents" under and as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement and subject to the terms thereof for all purposes, including without limitation, for purposes of amending, modifying, varying or waiving any provision thereof, releasing any collateral thereunder, exercising any rights or remedies thereunder, directing the Collateral Agent thereunder to take any action thereunder or with respect thereto, removing the Collateral Agent and for purposes of sharing the proceeds of the collateral thereunder with the other First Lien Secured Parties. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Trustee shall (and is hereby authorized to) take or instruct the Collateral Agent thereunder to take such actions under the Security Documents or related thereto as requested by the Required Secured Parties from time to time, and notwithstanding any provision in this Indenture to the contrary, unless all debt secured by the Security Documents has been Discharged, the Trustee will not release or instruct the Collateral Agent thereunder to release any Collateral unless such release has been consented to by each other Project Credit Party or such Collateral has been released from the Lien securing the obligations owed to all other First Lien Secured Parties. The Holders hereby designate and direct the Trustee to designate, and the Trustee hereby designates Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas as its collateral agent to act as specified in and under the Intercreditor Agreement, this Indenture, the Security Documents and any other such documents or instruments entered into by Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (and its successors) as the collateral agent for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders. In addition, regardless of whether required by the Intercreditor Agreement, each Holder hereby agrees that to the extent that the Holders obtain a recovery under a title insurance policy that insures the Deeds of Trust, and such recovery would result in the Holders receiving a greater percentage recovery on the Notes (relative to the outstanding principal amount of the Notes) than the corresponding percentage recovery that will
 
be obtained by the other First Lien Secured Parties that are parties to (or whose representative is party to) the Intercreditor Agreement as of the date of this Indenture (after giving effect to Section 8 of the Intercreditor Agreement and the title insurance proceeds received by such other First Lien Secured Parties from their policies of title insurance) in connection with the exercise of remedies or other event or loss that gave rise to the recovery obtained by the Holders, then the Holders will turn over a portion of such proceeds to the Collateral Agent for distribution to such other First Lien Secured Parties in amounts necessary to ensure that each such party receives a similar percentage recovery (relative to the outstanding principal amount of First Lien Secured Obligations then held by such party) from such proceeds. The Issuers and the Guarantors hereby consent to the foregoing provisions. Each Project Credit Party is an express beneficiary of this Section 10.01(b) and the provisions of this Section 10.01(b) may not be amended or modified without the consent of each Project Credit Party.

Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and performance and not a guarantee of collection.
(b) The Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder are unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes, this Indenture or the Collateral Documents, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Issuers, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor. Each of the Guarantors hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of either Issuer, any right to require a proceeding first against the Issuers, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenant that this Note Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and this Indenture.

provided
In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to (a) either Issuer, (b) any Significant Restricted Subsidiary of
 
Wynn Las Vegas or (c) any group of Restricted Subsidiaries of Wynn Las Vegas that, taken together, all outstanding Notes shall become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately. Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and in the other Collateral Documents. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal or interest or premium or Liquidated Damages, if any. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes, waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or premium or Liquidated Damages, if any, on, or the principal of, the Notes. The Issuers are required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture and the Collateral Documents. Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Issuers are required to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.
(14) . The Indenture authorizes the Trustee to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement on behalf of itself and the Holders of the Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes to exercise certain rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the agent under the Credit Agreement will have the right, subject to certain limited exceptions, to direct the Collateral Agent to enter into amendments of, or waive defaults under, the Collateral Documents that grant Liens on the Collateral without obtaining consent of the Trustee or the Holders of the Notes. At any time when at least $100.0 million in Indebtedness remains outstanding under the Credit Agreement, the agent under the Credit Agreement will also have the right to amend the Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Trustee or the Holders of the Notes, so long as such amendment only affects the subordination provisions in respect of any junior Indebtedness but does not affect the provisions governing the relationship between the lenders under the Credit Agreement and the Holders of the Notes.
Intercreditor Agreement
(15) . The Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Issuers or any Affiliate of the Issuers with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. However, in the event that the Trustee acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to continue as trustee or resign. Any Agent may do the same with like rights and duties. The Trustee is also subject to Sections 7.10 and 7.11 of the Indenture.
Trustee Dealings with Issuers
(16) . No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, organizer, equity holder or member of either Issuer, any of the Restricted Subsidiaries of Wynn Las Vegas or any Guarantor, as such, shall have any liability for
No Recourse Against Others
 
any obligations of either Issuer, any such Restricted Subsidiary or any Guarantor under the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Indenture, the Collateral Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws.
(17) . This Note shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature of the Trustee or an authenticating agent.

Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (= tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian), and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts to Minors Act).

Because such Broker-Dealer may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Act and must, therefore, deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Act in connection with its initial sale of any Initial Exchange Notes received by such Broker-Dealer in the Exchange Offer, the Issuers and Guarantors shall permit the use of the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement by such Broker-Dealer to satisfy such prospectus delivery requirement.

provided
To the extent necessary to ensure that the Shelf Registration Statement is available for sales of Transfer Restricted Securities by the Holders thereof entitled to the benefit of this Section 4(a) and the other securities required to be registered therein pursuant to Section 6(b)(ii) hereof, the Issuers and the Guarantors shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to keep any Shelf Registration Statement required by this Section 4(a) continuously effective, supplemented, amended and current as required by and subject to (i) the provisions of Sections 6(b) and (c) hereof and (ii) any applicable Suspension Period, and in conformity with the requirements of this Agreement, the Act and the policies, rules and regulations of the Commission as announced from time to time, for a period of at least two years, or one year if such Shelf Registration Statement is filed at the request of a Holder or Holders, (in each case, as such time may be extended pursuant to Section 6(d) hereof) following the Closing Date, or such shorter period as will terminate when all Transfer Restricted Securities covered by such Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant thereto or when all Initial Notes cease to be Transfer Restricted Securities.

No Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities may include any of its Transfer Restricted Securities in any Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such Holder furnishes to the Issuers in writing, within 15 Business Days after receipt of a request therefor, the information required by Item 507 or 508 of Regulation S-K, as applicable, of the Act or other information reasonably requested by the Issuers and required by Regulation S-K of the Act in order to fulfill their obligations hereunder for use in connection with any Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or preliminary prospectus included therein. No Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities shall be entitled to liquidated damages pursuant to Section 5 hereof unless and until such Holder shall have provided all such information. Each selling Holder agrees to promptly furnish additional information as requested by the Commission or as required to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the Issuers by such Holder not materially misleading.
Provision by Holders of Certain Information in Connection with the Shelf Registration Statement
 
If (a) any Registration Statement required by this Agreement is not filed with the Commission on or prior to the applicable Filing Deadline, (b) any such Registration Statement has not been declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the applicable Effectiveness Deadline, (c) the Exchange Offer has not been Consummated on or prior to the Consummation Deadline or (d) any Registration Statement required by this Agreement is filed and declared

The indemnifying party shall indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments by reason of any settlement of any action (i) effected with the indemnifying party's written consent or (ii) effected without the indemnifying party's written consent, if the settlement is entered into more than 30 business days after the indemnifying party shall have received a request from the indemnified party for reimbursement for the fees and expenses of counsel (in any case where such fees and expenses are at the expense of the indemnifying party) and, prior to the date of such settlement, the indemnifying party shall have failed to comply with such reimbursement request. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action in respect of which the indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity or contribution may be or could have been sought hereunder by the indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability on claims that are or could have been the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party.

(d) To the extent that the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuers and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Indemnified Holders, on the other hand, from their sale of Transfer Restricted Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Issuers and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and of the Indemnified Holder, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Issuers and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and of the Indemnified Holder, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such Issuer or such Guarantor, on the one hand, or by the Indemnified Holder, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(a), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
The Issuers, the Guarantors and each Indemnified Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Indemnified Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any matter, including any action that could have given rise to such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Indemnified Holder, its directors, its officers or any Person, if any, who controls such Indemnified Holder shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the total received by such Indemnified Holder with respect to the sale of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds (i) the amount paid by such Indemnified Holder for such Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) the amount of any damages which such Indemnified Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Indemnified Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(c) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities held by each Indemnified Holder hereunder and not joint.
 
Each Issuer and each Guarantor agrees with each Holder, for so long as any Transfer Restricted Securities remain outstanding and during any period in which such Issuer and such Guarantor (i) is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to make available, upon request of any Holder, to such Holder or beneficial owner of Transfer Restricted Securities in connection with any sale thereof and any prospective purchaser of such Transfer Restricted Securities designated by such Holder or beneficial owner, the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Act in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144A, and (ii) is subject to Section 13 or 15 (d) of the Exchange Act, to make all filings required thereby in a timely manner in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144.
 
(a) . The Issuers and the Guarantors acknowledge and agree that any failure by the Issuers and/or the Guarantors to comply with their respective obligations under Sections 3 and 4 hereof may result in material irreparable injury to the Initial Purchasers or the Holders for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Initial Purchasers or any Holder may obtain such relief as may be required to specifically enforce the Issuers' and the Guarantor's obligations under Sections 3 and 4 hereof. The Issuers and the Guarantors further agree to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate.
Remedies
(b) . Neither of the Issuers nor any Guarantor will, on or after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. The Issuers and the Guarantors represent and warrant to the Holders and the Initial Purchasers that the rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of the Issuers' and the Guarantors' securities under any agreement in effect on the date hereof.
No Inconsistent Agreements
(c) . The provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to or departures from the provisions hereof may not be given unless (i) in the case of Section 5 hereof and this Section 10(c)(i), the Issuers have obtained the written consent of Holders of all outstanding Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) in the case of all other provisions hereof, the Issuers have obtained the written consent of Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities (excluding Transfer Restricted Securities held by the Issuers or their Affiliates). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to or departure from the provisions hereof that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose Transfer Restricted Securities are being tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer, and that does not affect, directly or indirectly, the rights of other Holders whose Transfer Restricted Securities are not being tendered pursuant to such Exchange Offer, may be given by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities subject to such Exchange Offer.

The Holders shall be third party beneficiaries to the agreements made hereunder between the Issuers and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and shall have the right to enforce such agreements directly to the extent they may deem such enforcement necessary or advisable to protect the rights of Holders hereunder.

Notwithstanding any provision of the Disbursement Agreement to the contrary, such Notice of Advance Request must be received by the Issuing Lender at least 3 Business Days (or such shorter period agreed to by the Issuing Lender) prior to the proposed date of issuance (in addition to such other documents, certificates, documents and papers as the Issuing Lender may request) and must contain all the information relevant to the proposed Letter of Credit issuance as set forth in a Letter of Credit Request.
 
(b) The Borrower shall have the right pursuant to this Section 3.2(b) to request that the Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit (i) if prior to the Amended and Restated Disbursement Agreement Effective Date, to be utilized for purposes permitted hereby other than in furtherance of the payment or support for Project Costs and (ii) if on or after the Amended and Restated Disbursement Agreement Effective Date, to be utilized for general corporate purposes (including in furtherance of the payment or support for Project Costs). If the Borrower desires that the Issuing Lender issue such a Letter of Credit, the Borrower may request that the Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to the Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent, at least 3 Business Days (or such shorter period agreed to by the Issuing Lender) prior to the proposed date of issuance (such proposed date to be a Business Day), a Letter of Credit Request accompanied by such other documents, certificates, documents and papers as the Issuing Lender may reasonably request. Letter of Credit Requests may be delivered by facsimile transmission.
Promptly after the issuance or amendment of a Letter of Credit (in any event upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.2 or 5.3, as applicable), the Issuing Lender shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, in writing, of such issuance or amendment and such notice shall be accompanied by a copy of such issuance or amendment. Upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Revolving Credit 1 Lenders in writing of such issuance or amendment and if so requested by any such Lender the Administrative Agent shall furnish such Lender with a copy of such issuance or amendment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuing Lender shall not be obligated to make any Letters of Credit available to the Borrower at a time when a Lender Default exists unless the Issuing Lender has entered into arrangements satisfactory to it to eliminate the Issuing Lender's risk with respect to the Defaulting Lender's or Lenders' participation in such Letters of Credit.
In the event that a Lender Default with respect to a Revolving Credit 1 Lender occurs at a time when any Letter of Credit is outstanding, then (i) such Revolving Credit 1 Lender shall be deemed a "Defaulting Lender and (ii) unless a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at such time, such Revolving Credit 1 Lender's Revolving Credit 1 Percentage of all undrawn and unexpired amount of such Letters of Credit shall be reallocated among the Revolving Credit 1 Lenders that are not Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Credit 1 Percentages (adjusted to eliminate the effect of any Defaulting Lenders), but only to the extent that (a) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolving Credit 1 Extensions of Credit (following the reallocation) does not exceed the Total Revolving Credit 1 Commitments of all Revolving Credit 1 Lenders that are non Defaulting Lenders. If the reallocation described in the immediately preceding sentence cannot, or can only partially, be effected, Borrower shall, within five (5) Business Days following the request of the Issuing Bank, deposit in a cash collateral account opened by the Administrative Agent an amount in immediately available funds equal to the aggregate then undrawn and unexpired amount of such Letters of Credit multiplied by such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Credit 1 Percentage (less the portion of such amount that has been reallocated pursuant to the prior sentence) (and the Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, a continuing security interest in all amounts at any time on deposit in such cash collateral account to secure the Defaulting Lender's Revolving Credit 1 Percentage of the aggregate
 
amount of all such undrawn and unexpired amount of such Letters of Credit). If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that any funds held in such cash collateral account are subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties or that the total amount of such funds is less than the amount specified above, the Borrower shall, within five (5) Business Days following demand by the Administrative Agent, pay to the Administrative Agent, as additional funds to be deposited and held in such cash collateral account, an amount equal to the excess of (a) such aggregate undrawn and unexpired amount of Letters of Credit multiplied by the aggregate Revolving Credit 1 Percentages of all Defaulting Lenders (less the portion of such amount that has been reallocated pursuant to the prior sentence) over (b) the total amount of funds, if any, then held in such cash collateral account that the Administrative Agent determines to be free and clear of any such right and claim. Amounts held in such cash collateral account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to the payment of drafts drawn under such Letters of Credit, and the unused portion thereof after all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon (or upon any such Defaulting Lender ceasing to be a Defaulting Lender), if any, shall be returned to the Borrower.

In addition, the Borrower shall pay to the Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee equal to 0.125% per annum on the aggregate drawable amount of each outstanding Letter of Credit (but in any event not less than $500.00 per annum per Letter of Credit), payable quarterly in arrears on each L/C Fee Payment Date after the issuance date of such Letter of Credit.

Upon any change in the Revolving Credit 1 Percentage of any L/C Participant, the L/C participations allocated to each L/C Participant shall be automatically reallocated such that each L/C Participant shall hold for its own risk and account an undivided interest equal to such L/C Participants new Revolving Credit 1 Percentage in the Issuing Lender's obligations and rights under each Letter of Credit issued hereunder and the amount of each draft paid by the Issuing Lender thereunder. Each L/C Participant unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with the Issuing Lender that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit for which the Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Issuing Lender, regardless of the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Section 5, upon demand, at the Issuing Lender's address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participant's Revolving Credit 1 Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, that is not so reimbursed.

If any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 3.4(a) is not made available to the Issuing Lender by such L/C Participant within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, the Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans constituting Revolving Credit 1 Loans. A certificate of the Issuing Lender submitted to any L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
 
(c) Whenever, at any time after the Issuing Lender has made payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant its share of such payment in accordance with Section 3.4(a), the Issuing Lender receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of collateral applied thereto by the Issuing Lender), or any payment of interest on account thereof, the Issuing Lender will distribute to such L/C Participant its share thereof; , , that in the event that any such payment received by the Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by the Issuing Lender, such L/C Participant shall return to the Issuing Lender the portion thereof previously distributed by the Issuing Lender to it.

Amounts held in such cash collateral account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to the payment of drafts drawn under such Letters of Credit, and the unused portion thereof after all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon, if any, shall be applied to repay other Obligations of the Loan Parties. After all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon, all Reimbursement Obligations shall have been satisfied and all other Obligations of the Loan Parties shall have been paid in full, the balance, if any, in such cash collateral account shall be returned to the Loan Parties (or such other Person as may be lawfully entitled thereto). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event the consent of the Lenders (whether the Required Lenders, the Required Facility Lenders for a particular Facility or otherwise) is required in connection with the exercise of remedies pursuant to this Section 8, for purposes of determining the required lender consent pursuant to the applicable definitions thereto (whether the "Required Lenders", the "Required Facility Lenders" or otherwise), the Commitments of the Lenders shall be deemed terminated. Anything in this Section 8 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Required Lenders, rescind and annul any acceleration of the Loans and the termination of the Commitments by written instrument filed with the Borrower. Upon any such rescission and annulment, the Administrative Agent shall promptly return to the Borrower any cash collateral delivered pursuant to this paragraph.
