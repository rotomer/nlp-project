Management Discussion and Analysis
Cotai Development
In September 2011, the Group formally accepted the terms and conditions of a draft land concession contract from the Macau government for approximately 51 acres of land in the Cotai area of Macau (the "Cotai Land"). In December 2011, we paid the initial deposit of MOP500 million (approximately HK$485.4 million) pursuant to this draft land concession contract. We will also need to make eight additional semi-annual payments in the amount of MOP130.9 million (approximately HK$127.1 million) each, which includes 5% interest as required by the Macau government. The fi rst of the eight semi-annual payments is due six months from the date the Cotai Land concession is published in the offi cial gazette of Macau. Following government approval, we anticipate constructing a full scale integrated resort on this land containing a casino, approximately 2,000 hotel suites, convention, retail, entertainment and food and beverage offerings. We continue working to fi nalize the project scope, timeline and budget.
Cotai Land Contract
On 1 August 2008, Palo Real Estate Company Limited and certain affi liates of our Company entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party that is not a connected person of the Group to make a one-time payment in the amount of US$50 million (approximately HK$389 million) in consideration of the latter's relinquishment of certain rights in and to any future development on the Cotai Land. This agreement provides that the payment be made within 15 days after the publication date of the Cotai land contract in the offi cial gazette of Macau. Palo Real Estate Company Limited has accrued this payment as a current liability included in other accrued liabilities as of 31 December 2011.
Macau
Macau, which was a territory under Portuguese administration for approximately 450 years, was transferred from Portuguese to Chinese political control in December 1999. Macau is governed as a special administrative region of China and is located approximately 37 miles southwest of, and approximately one hour away via ferry from, Hong Kong. Macau, which has been a casino destination for more than 40 years, consists principally of a peninsula on mainland China, and two neighboring islands, Taipa and Coloane. We believe that Macau is located in one of the world's largest concentrations of potential gaming customers. According to Macau Statistical Information, casinos in Macau generated approximately HK$260.1 billion in gaming revenue during the year ended 31 December 2011, an increase of approximately 42.2% over the approximate HK$182.9 billion generated in the year ended 31 December 2010, making Macau the largest gaming market in the world.
Macau's gaming market is primarily dependent on tourists. Tourist arrivals in 2011 were 28 million compared to 25 million in 2010. The Macau market has experienced tremendous growth in capacity in the last few years. As at 31 December 2011, there were 22,356 hotel rooms and 5,302 table games in Macau, compared to 12,978 hotel rooms and 2,762 table games as at 31 December 2006.
 
Annual Report 2011 7
Management Discussion and Analysis
FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Tourism
The levels of tourism and overall gaming activities in Macau are key drivers of our business. Both the Macau gaming market and visitation to Macau have grown signifi cantly in the last few years. We have benefi ted from the rise in visitation to Macau over the past several years.
Gaming customers traveling to Macau typically come from nearby destinations in Asia including mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore. According to the Macau Statistics and Census Service Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, approximately 89% of visitors to Macau for the year ended 31 December 2011 were from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Tourism levels in Macau are affected by a number of factors, all of which are beyond our control. Key factors affecting tourism levels in Macau may include, among others:
 -  Prevailing economic conditions in mainland China and Asia;
 -  Various countries' policies on the issuance of travel visas that may be in place from time to time and could affect travel to Macau;
 -  Competition from other destinations which offer gaming and leisure activities;
 -  Possible changes to government restrictions on currency conversion or the ability to export currency from mainland China or other countries;
 -  Occurrence of natural disasters and disruption of travel; and
 -  Possible outbreaks of infectious disease.
Economic and Operating Environment
Our operating environment remained stable in 2011. However, economic conditions can have a signifi cant impact on our business. A number of factors, including a slowdown in the global economy, contracting credit markets, reduced consumer spending, various countries' policies that affect travel to Macau and any outbreak of infectious diseases can negatively impact the gaming industry in Macau and our business.
 
8 Wynn Macau, Limited
Management Discussion and Analysis
Competition
Since the liberalization of Macau's gaming industry in 2002, there has been a signifi cant increase in the number of casino properties in Macau. Currently, there are six gaming operators in Macau, including WRM. The three concessionaires are WRM, SJM, and Galaxy which opened Galaxy Macau, a major resort in the Cotai area, on 15 May 2011. The three subconcessionaires are Melco Crown, MGM Macau, and Venetian Macau. As at 31 December 2011, there were approximately 34 casinos in Macau, including 20 operated by SJM. Each of the current six operators has operating casinos and expansion plans announced or underway.
Wynn Macau also faces competition from casinos primarily located in other areas of Asia, such as Resorts World Sentosa and Marina Bay Sands which opened in February and April 2010, respectively, in Singapore and Genting Highlands Resort located outside of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia as well as casinos in the Philippines. Wynn Macau also encounters competition from other major gaming centers located around the world, including Australia and Las Vegas, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming, and other casinos throughout Asia. Further, if current efforts to legalize gaming in other Asian countries are successful, Wynn Macau will face additional regional competition.
Gaming Promoters
A signifi cant amount of our casino play is brought to us by gaming promoters. Gaming promoters have historically played a critical role in the Macau gaming market and are important to our casino business.
Gaming promoters introduce premium VIP players to Wynn Macau and often assist those clients with their travel and entertainment arrangements. In addition, gaming promoters often grant credit to their players. In exchange for their services, Wynn Macau generally pays the gaming promoters a percentage of the gross gaming win generated by each gaming promoter. Approximately 80% of these commissions are netted against casino revenues, because such commissions approximate the amount of the commission returned to the VIP players by the gaming promoters, and approximately 20% of these commissions are included in other operating expenses, which approximate the amount of the commission ultimately retained by the gaming promoters for their compensation. The total amount of commissions paid to these promoters and netted against casino revenues were HK$8.1 billion and HK$5.8 billion for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010, respectively. Commissions increased 38.8% for the year ended 31 December 2011 compared to the year ended
31 December 2010, due to increased volumes of play generated by gaming promoters and the addition of fi ve new gaming promoters. Additionally, gaming promoters each receive a monthly complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the turnover their clients generate.
 
Annual Report 2011 9
Management Discussion and Analysis
The allowance is available for room, food and beverage and other products and services for discretionary use with clients. We typically advance commissions to gaming promoters at the beginning of each month to facilitate their working capital requirements. These advances are provided to a gaming promoter and are offset by the commissions earned by such gaming promoter during the applicable month. The aggregate amounts of exposure to our gaming promoters, which is the difference between commissions advanced to each individual gaming promoter, and the commissions payable to each such gaming promoter, were HK$367.1 million and HK$246.3 million as at 31 December 2011 and 2010, respectively. These outstanding commissions were cleared no later than the fi fth day of the succeeding month and prior to the advancement of any further funds to a gaming promoter. We believe we have developed strong relationships with our gaming promoters. Our commission percentages have remained stable throughout our operating history.
Premium Credit Play
We selectively extend credit to players contingent upon our marketing team's knowledge of the players, their fi nancial background and payment history. We follow a series of credit procedures and require from each credit recipient various signed documents that are intended to ensure among other things that, if permitted by applicable law, the debt can be legally enforced in the jurisdiction where the player resides. In the event the player does not reside in a jurisdiction where gaming debts are legally enforceable, we often can assert jurisdiction over assets the player maintains in jurisdictions where gaming debts are recognized. In addition, we typically require a check in the amount of the applicable credit line from credit players, collateralizing the credit we grant to a player.
Number and Mix of Table Games and Slot Machines
The mix of VIP table games, mass table games and slot machines in operation at our resort changes from time to time as a result of marketing and operating strategies in response to changing market demand and industry competition. The shift in the mix of our games will affect casino profi tability.
ADJUSTED EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before fi nance costs, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening costs, property charges and other, share-based payments, and other non-operating income/ (expense). Adjusted EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because our Directors believe that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Our Adjusted EBITDA presented herein also differs from the Adjusted EBITDA presented by Wynn Resorts, Limited for its Macau segment in its fi lings with the SEC, primarily due to the inclusion of royalty fees, adjustments for IFRS differences with U.S. GAAP, corporate support and other support services in arriving at operating profi t.

Discussion of Results of Operations
Financial results for the year ended 31 December 2011 compared to fi nancial results for the year ended 31 December 2010
Our results of operations for the periods presented are not comparable as the year ended 31 December 2011 include the operations of Encore for the full year whereas the year ended 31 December 2010 only included the operations of Encore from its opening on 21 April 2010.
 
14 Wynn Macau, Limited
Management Discussion and Analysis
Operating Revenues
Total operating revenues increased by 31.5% from HK$22.4 billion in 2010 to HK$29.5 billion in 2011. We believe this increase was due to a combination of factors, including increased visitation and overall gaming volumes in Macau during 2011 as well as the full year results of Encore.
Casino Revenues
Casino revenues increased by 31.8%, from HK$21.1 billion (93.8% of total operating revenues) in 2010 to HK$27.8 billion (94.1% of total operating revenues) in 2011. The components and reasons are as follows:
VIP casino gaming operations. VIP gross table games win increased by 31.7%, from HK$21.3 billion in 2010 to HK$28.1 billion in 2011. VIP table games turnover increased by 35.2%, from HK$709.1 billion in 2010 to HK$958.4 billion in 2011. VIP gross table games win as a percentage of turnover (calculated before discounts and commissions) decreased from 3.0% in 2010 to 2.9% in 2011 (win percentages are within the expected range of 2.7% to 3.0%). On 21 April 2010, we added 37 VIP tables with the opening of Encore which helped drive some of the growth in our VIP segment during the year ended 31 December 2011 compared to the prior year.
Mass market casino gaming operations. Mass market gross table games win increased by 42.9%, from HK$4.3 billion in 2010 to HK$6.1 billion in 2011. Mass market table games drop increased by 18.4%, from HK$18.2 billion in 2010 to HK$21.6 billion in 2011. The mass market gross table games win percentage (calculated before discounts) was 23.6% in 2010 compared to 28.4% in 2011, which was higher than the expected win percentage range of 26% to 28%. We have increased our expected mass market range to 26% to 28% based on our experience since the opening of Encore.
Slot machine gaming operations. Slot machine win increased by 27.1% from HK$1.7 billion in 2010 to HK$2.2 billion in 2011. Slot machine handle increased by 28.6%, from HK$32.7 billion in 2010 to HK$42.0 billion in 2011. The increases resulted primarily from increased visitation to our resort and the full year results of Encore. Consequently, total gross slot win increased and slot machine win per unit per day increased by 48.5% from HK$3,985 in 2010 to HK$5,916 in 2011.
 
Annual Report 2011 15
Management Discussion and Analysis
Non-casino Revenues
Net non-casino revenues, which include room, food and beverage and retail revenues, increased by 26.1%, from HK$1,381.3 million (6.2% of total operating revenues) in 2010 to HK$1,742.1 million (5.9% of total operating revenues) in 2011. The increase in revenues was largely due to stronger retail sales in 2011 and the full year results of Encore.
Rooms. Our room revenues, which exclude promotional allowances in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income, decreased by 2.3% from HK$143.8 million in 2010 to HK$140.5 million in 2011. A higher proportion of our rooms were provided on a complimentary basis in 2011 as compared to 2010 to meet increased demand from VIP clients and high-limit mass market customers.
Management also evaluates room revenues on an adjusted basis which include promotional allowances. Adjusted room revenues including promotional allowances increased by 28.7% from HK$713.8 million in 2010 to HK$918.9 million in 2011.
The following table presents additional information about our adjusted room revenues (which include promotional allowances):

Food and beverage.

The increase refl ects higher business volumes and the opening of Encore in April 2010.
 
16 Wynn Macau, Limited
Management Discussion and Analysis
Management also evaluates food and beverage revenues on an adjusted basis including promotional allowances. Food and beverage revenues in 2011 adjusted to include these promotional allowances were HK$724.2 million, a 31.6% increase from 2010 adjusted revenues of HK$550.5 million refl ecting the increase in business volumes and the opening of Encore in April 2010.
Retail and other. Our retail and other revenues, which exclude promotional allowances in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income, increased by 31.9%, from HK$1,071.6 million in 2010 to HK$1,413.5 million in 2011. The increase was due primarily to increased same-store sales and the addition of new outlets.
Management also evaluates retail and other revenues on an adjusted basis which includes promotional allowances. Adjusted retail and other revenues including promotional allowances increased by 32.6% from HK$1,093.9 million in 2010 to HK$1,451.0 million in 2011, refl ecting the increased same-store sales and the new outlets.
Operating Costs and Expenses
Gaming taxes and premiums. Gaming taxes and premiums increased by 32.9%, from HK$10.8 billion in 2010 to HK$14.4 billion in 2011. This increase was due to increased gross gaming win in 2011 compared to 2010. Wynn Macau is subject to a 35% gaming tax on gross gaming win. In addition, Wynn Macau is also required to pay 4% of its gross gaming win as contributions for public development and social facilities.
Staff costs. Staff costs increased by 13.5%, from HK$1.8 billion in 2010 to HK$2.1 billion in 2011. The increase was primarily due to the hiring of additional staff for Encore which had a full year operations in 2011.
Other operating expenses. Other operating expenses increased by 27.8%, from HK$4.1 billion in 2010 to HK$5.2 billion in 2011. The increase in other operating costs was primarily due to increased business volume related expenses such as gaming promoters' commissions, cost of sales and royalty fees.
Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased by 2.7% from HK$989.5 million in 2010 to HK$1,016.4 million in 2011. This increase was primarily due to the impact of assets placed in service with the opening of Encore in April 2010 offset by the decrease in depreciation expense due to assets with a 5-year life being fully depreciated as of September 2011.
 
Annual Report 2011 17
Management Discussion and Analysis
Property charges and other. Property charges and other increased from HK$47.0 million in 2010 to HK$865.9 million in 2011. Included in property charges and other for the year ended 31 December 2011 is a charge of HK$831.1 million refl ecting the present value of a charitable contribution made by WRM to the University of Macau Development Foundation. This contribution consists of a MOP200.0 million (approximately HK$194.2 million) payment made in May 2011, and a commitment for additional donations of MOP80.0 million (approximately HK$77.7 million) each year for the calendar years 2012 through 2022 inclusive, for a total of MOP1,080.0 million (approximately HK$1,048.5 million). The amount refl ected in our accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income has been discounted using our current estimated borrowing rate over the time period of the remaining committed payments. Other charges in each period represent gain/ loss on the sale of equipment as well as costs related to assets retired or abandoned as a result of renovating certain assets of Wynn Macau in response to customer preferences and changes in market demand.
As a result of the foregoing, total operating costs and expenses increased by 32.5%, from HK$17.7 billion in 2010 to HK$23.5 billion in 2011.
Finance Revenues
Finance revenues increased from HK$2.0 million in 2010 to HK$49.1 million in 2011. During 2011 and 2010, our short-term investment strategy has been to preserve capital while retaining suffi cient liquidity. While we have recently invested in certain corporate debt securities which contributed to the increase in interest income, the majority of our short-term investments are primarily in time deposits with a maturity of three months or less.
Finance Costs
Finance costs increased by 1.5%, from HK$255.5 million in 2010 to HK$259.4 million in 2011. Finance costs increased in 2011 primarily due to the reduction in capitalized interest offset by the reduction in amounts outstanding under the Wynn Macau Credit Facility and lower interest rates in 2011 compared to 2010.
Interest Rate Swaps
As required under the terms of our various credit facilities, we have entered into agreements which swap a portion of the interest on our loans from fl oating to fi xed rates. These transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting.
 
18 Wynn Macau, Limited
Management Discussion and Analysis
Changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as an increase or decrease in swap fair value during each year. We recorded a gain of HK$80.4 million for 2011 resulting from the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps in 2011. We recorded a gain of HK$26.5 million in 2010 resulting from the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps in 2010.
Income Tax Expense
In 2011, our income tax benefi t was HK$26.8 million compared to an income tax expense of HK$44.1 million in 2010. Our current income tax benefi t for 2011 primarily relates to the reversal of HK$41.8 million reserve previously established for potential tax assessments for years 2006 and before, which has closed and income tax expense of HK$15.0 million for our subsidiaries owning WRM's shares under the WRM Shareholder Dividend Tax Agreement. Our 2010 current income tax expense primarily relates to income tax expense recorded by WRM to increase tax reserves for possible unfavorable tax outcomes and income tax expense of our subsidiaries owning WRM's shares under the WRM Shareholder Dividend Tax Agreement. Our 2010 deferred income tax provision primarily results from WRM derecognizing certain deferred tax assets no longer believed realizable.
Net Profi t Attributable to Owners of the Company
As a result of the foregoing, net profi t attributable to owners of the Company increased by 33.9%, from HK$4.4 billion in 2010 to HK$5.9 billion in 2011.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Capital Resources
Since Wynn Macau opened in 2006, we have generally funded our working capital and recurring expenses as well as capital expenditures from cash fl ow from operations and cash on hand.

Management Discussion and Analysis
Net cash used in fi nancing activities
Net cash used in fi nancing activities was HK$6.6 billion during 2011 compared to HK$7.3 billion during 2010. The decrease was due to the HK$6.2 billion dividend payment made in 2011 compared to a combining effect from the HK$3.9 billion dividend payment and the HK$3.1 billion repayment net of borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities made in 2010.

Wynn Macau Credit Facilities
Overview
As at 31 December 2011, WRM's credit facilities consisted of HK$12.1 billion in a combination of Hong Kong dollar and U.S. dollar facilities, including a HK$4.3 billion fully funded senior term loan facility and a HK$7.8 billion senior revolving credit facility. The facilities may be used for a variety of purposes, including further enhancements at our resort, investments in other projects in Macau and general corporate purposes.
 
22 Wynn Macau, Limited
Management Discussion and Analysis
We have the ability to increase secured debt under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities by up to an additional US$50 million (approximately HK$389 million).
As at 31 December 2011, we had total bank and other borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities of HK$4.9 billion, of which HK$1.4 billion was denominated in U.S. dollars and HK$3.5 billion was denominated in Hong Kong dollars.
Principal and Interest
The term loans under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities mature in June 2014, and the revolving loans under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities mature in June 2012.
The principal amount of the term loans is required to be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing in September 2011. Borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities bear interest at LIBOR or HIBOR plus a margin of 1.75%, through
30 September 2010. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2010, the revolving loans, the hotel facility of the term loan and tranches A and B of the project facility of the term loan became subject to a margin of 1.25% to 2.00% depending on the Group's leverage ratio at the end of each quarter. Tranche C of the project facility of the term loan remains subject to a margin of 1.75%. As at 31 December 2011, the weighted average margin is 1.29%.
General Covenants
The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain customary covenants restricting certain activities of the obligor group (WM Cayman Holdings Limited II and all of its subsidiaries except Palo Real Estate Company Limited), which does not include the Company, including, but not limited to, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the incurrence or creation of liens on property, sale and leaseback transactions, the ability to dispose of assets and the making of loans or certain other investments, entering into mergers, consolidations, liquidations or amalgamations, forming or acquiring subsidiaries, amending, modifying or terminating certain material contracts, permits and governing documents, entering into certain transactions with affi liates, changing fi scal periods, entering into business activities other than certain permitted activities, and selling or discounting receivables, in each case, subject to certain permitted exceptions.
Financial Covenants
The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities fi nancial covenants require WRM to maintain a Leverage Ratio, as defi ned in the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, of not greater than 3.50 to 1 as at 31 December 2011, and an Interest Coverage Ratio, as defi ned in the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, of not less than 2 to 1. Management believes that the Group was in compliance with all covenants as at 31 December 2011. Going forward, the Group is required to maintain a Leverage Ratio not greater than 3.50 to 1. The Interest Coverage Ratio requirement remains at not less than 2 to 1.
 
Annual Report 2011 23
Management Discussion and Analysis
Compliance with Covenants
The Directors confi rm that there is no material non-compliance with the fi nancial covenants or general covenants contained in the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.
Mandatory Prepayment
The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain mandatory prepayment provisions, which include, among other matters, prepayment of 50% of excess cash fl ow, as defi ned in the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, if WRM's Leverage Ratio is greater than 4 to 1 for any reporting period. Based on current estimates, the Group does not believe that the Wynn Macau Leverage Ratio during the fi scal year ending 31 December 2012 will exceed 4 to 1. Accordingly, the Group does not expect to make any mandatory prepayments pursuant to this requirement during 2012.
Dividend Restrictions
WRM and certain of its affi liates are subject to restrictions on payment of dividends or distributions or other amounts to their shareholders or to other affi liates, unless certain fi nancial and non-fi nancial criteria have been satisfi ed. Provided certain conditions are met, WRM is permitted to pay dividends. The conditions to be satisfi ed for the payment of dividends include:
 -  Compliance with applicable legal requirements;
 -  No event of default occurring under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities;
 -  Compliance with the applicable fi nancial covenants; and
 -  Such dividends may be made once in each fi scal quarter (and in respect of the fi rst fi scal quarter in a fi scal year, only after borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities have been prepaid to the extent required by the application of the excess cash fl ow mandatory prepayment provisions).
WRM is currently in compliance with all requirements, namely satisfaction of its Leverage Ratio, which must be met in order to pay dividends and is presently able to pay dividends in accordance with the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.

Management Discussion and Analysis
Events of Default
The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain customary events of default, such as failure to pay, breach of covenants, initiation of insolvency proceedings, material adverse effect and cross default provisions. Events of default also include certain breaches of the terms of the Concession Agreement, and the taking of certain formal measures or administrative intervention by the Macau government in respect of the Concession Agreement or the concession for the land on which Wynn Macau is located. The situations triggering an event of default related to WRL's ownership and control of WRM under the Wynn Macau Credit
Facilities have been amended and limited to the situation where Wynn Resorts, Limited ceases to own or control at least 51% of WRM (or ceases to have the ability to direct the management of WRM) pursuant to consent obtained from the relevant parties on or about 22 August 2011.
Security and Guarantees
Collateral for the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities consists of substantially all of the assets of WRM. Certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries have executed guarantees and pledged their interests in WRM in support of the obligations under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities. With respect to the Concession Agreement, the WRM lenders do have certain cure rights and consultation rights with the Macau government upon an enforcement by the lenders.
Second Ranking Lender
WRM is also party to a bank guarantee reimbursement agreement with Banco National Ultramarino S.A. to secure a guarantee in favor of the Macau government as required under the Concession Agreement. The amount of this guarantee is MOP300 million (approximately HK$291.3 million) and it lasts until 180 days after the end of the term of the Concession Agreement. The guarantee assures WRM's performance under the Concession Agreement, including the payment of certain premiums, fi nes and indemnities for breach. The guarantee is secured by a second priority security interest in the same collateral package securing the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and conditions, such as infl ation, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates.
Foreign Exchange Risks
The fi nancial statements of foreign operations are translated into Hong Kong dollars, the Group's functional and presentation currency, for incorporation into the consolidated fi nancial statements. The majority of our assets and liabilities are denominated in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Macau patacas and Offshore RMB, and there are no signifi cant assets and liabilities denominated in other
 
Annual Report 2011 25
Management Discussion and Analysis
currencies. Assets and liabilities are translated at the prevailing foreign exchange rates in effect at the end of the reporting period. Income, expenditures and cash fl ow items are measured at the actual foreign exchange rates or average foreign exchange rates for the period. The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years. The Macau pataca is pegged to the Hong Kong dollar, and in many cases the two currencies are used interchangeably in Macau. However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca, and the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to, among other things, changes in governmental policies and international economic and political developments. In particular, our Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising primarily with respect to the Offshore RMB, which does not have pegged exchange linkages to the U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar or Macau pataca.
Interest Rate Risks
One of our primary exposures to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our credit facilities, which bear interest based on fl oating rates. We attempt to manage interest rate risk by managing the mix of long-term fi xed rate borrowings and variable rate borrowings supplemented by hedging activities as considered necessary. We cannot assure you that these risk management strategies will have the desired effect, and interest rate fl uctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
As at 31 December 2011, the Group had one interest rate swap intended to manage a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities. Under this swap agreement, the Group pays a fi xed interest rate of 2.15% on borrowings of approximately HK$2.3 billion incurred under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities in exchange for receipts on the same amount at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. As at 31 December 2011, this interest rate swap fi xes the interest rate on HK$2.3 billion of borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities at approximately 3.4%. This interest rate swap agreement will terminate in June 2012.
The carrying value of this interest rate swap on the consolidated statement of fi nancial position approximates its fair value. The fair value approximates the amount the Group would pay if this contract was settled at the respective valuation dates. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions and, therefore, is subject to signifi cant estimation and a high degree of variability of fl uctuation between periods. We adjust this amount by applying a non-performance valuation, considering our creditworthiness or the creditworthiness of our counterparties at each settlement date, as applicable. These transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting. Accordingly, changes in the fair values during the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010, were charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
 
26 Wynn Macau, Limited
Management Discussion and Analysis
Our liability under the swap agreement is secured by the same collateral package securing the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.
OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor do we engage in any transactions involving derivatives except for interest rate swaps. We do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity.
OTHER LIQUIDITY MATTERS
We expect to fund our operations and capital expenditure requirements from operating cash fl ows, cash on hand and availability under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities. However, we cannot be sure that operating cash fl ows will be suffi cient for those purposes. We may refi nance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot be sure that we will be able to refi nance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all.
New business developments (including our development of a project in Cotai) or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. There can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity. Any other development would require us to obtain additional fi nancing.
In the ordinary course of business, in response to market demands and client preferences, and in order to increase revenues, we have made and will continue to make enhancements and refi nements to our resort. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital expenditures related to these enhancements and refi nements.
Taking into consideration our fi nancial resources, including our cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and availability under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, we believe that we have suffi cient liquid assets to meet our working capital and operating requirements for the following 12 months.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

REMUNERATION POLICY
As at 31 December 2011, the Group had approximately 7,400 full-time equivalent employees. Employees of the Group are selected, remunerated and promoted on the basis of their merit, qualifi cations, competence and contribution to the Group.
Compensation of key executives of the Group is determined by the Company's remuneration committee which reviews and determines executives' compensation based on the Group's performance and the executives' respective contributions to the Group.
The Company also has a provident fund set up for its employees and a share options scheme. Further details on the Company's share options scheme are set out below.
SHARE OPTION SCHEME
The Company approved the adoption of a share option scheme on 16 September 2009 with the implementation of the scheme conditional on the Company's listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The purpose of the share option scheme is to reward participants, which may include Directors and employees of the Group, who have contributed to the Group and to encourage them to work towards enhancing the value of the Company and its Shares for the benefi t of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole. The options granted under the scheme do not give immediate ownership of the underlying Shares as they require payment of a subscription price which is based on the then prevailing market price of the Shares.
During the year ended 31 December 2011, a total of 400,000 Shares were granted (2010: 1 million Shares). A summary of the terms of the share option scheme is set out below:
Number of Shares Available for Issue under the Scheme
A maximum of 518.75 million Shares have been reserved for issuance under the share option scheme, representing 10.0% in nominal amount in the aggregate of Shares in issue as at the date of this Annual Report.
Maximum Entitlement of Participant
The maximum number of Shares issued and to be issued upon exercise of the share options granted to each participant under the share option scheme (including both exercised and outstanding share options) in any 12-month period shall not (when aggregated with any Shares subject to share options granted during such period under any other share option schemes of the Company other than those share options granted pursuant to specifi c approval by the Shareholders in a general meeting) exceed one percent of the Shares in issue for the time being.

INFORMATION CONCERNING MR. KAZUO OKADA
On 18 February 2012, WRL's Gaming Compliance Committee concluded a year-long investigation after receiving an independent report by Freeh, Sporkin & Sullivan, LLP (the "Freeh Report") detailing numerous prima facie violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") by Aruze USA, Inc., at the time a stockholder of WRL, Universal Entertainment Corporation, Aruze USA, Inc.'s parent company, and Kazuo Okada, the majority shareholder of Universal Entertainment Corporation, who is also a member of WRL's board of directors and was at the time a Director of the Company.
 
56 Wynn Macau, Limited
Report of the Directors
INFORMATION CONCERNING MR. KAZUO OKADA (continued)
Based on the Freeh Report, the board of directors of WRL determined that Aruze USA, Inc., Universal Entertainment Corporation and Mr. Okada are "unsuitable" under Article VII of the WRL articles of incorporation. The board of directors of WRL was unanimous (other than Mr. Okada) in its determination. The board of directors of WRL also requested that Mr. Okada resign as a director of WRL and recommended that Mr. Okada be removed as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company. On 18 February 2012, Mr. Okada was removed from the Board of Directors of Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of WRL.
Based on the board of directors of WRL's fi nding of "unsuitability", on 18 February 2012, WRL redeemed Aruze USA, Inc.'s 24,549,222 shares of WRL's common stock (the "Redemption Event"). Following a fi nding of "unsuitability", WRL's articles authorize redemption at "fair value" of the shares held by unsuitable persons. WRL engaged an independent fi nancial advisor to assist in the fair value calculation and concluded that a discount to the then-current trading price was appropriate because of, among other things, restrictions on most of the shares held by Aruze USA, Inc under the terms of an existing stockholders agreement. Pursuant to the articles of incorporation of WRL, on 18 February 2012, WRL issued a subordinated promissory note in redemption of all of the shares of WRL common stock held by Aruze USA, Inc. (the "Redemption Price Promissory Note"). The Redemption Price Promissory Note has a principal amount of approximately US$1.9 billion (approximately HK$14.7 billion), matures on 18 February 2022 and bears interest at the rate of 2% per annum, payable annually in arrears on each anniversary of the date of the Redemption Price Promissory Note. WRL may, in its sole and absolute discretion, at any time and from time to time, and without penalty or premium, prepay the whole or any portion of the principal or interest due under the Redemption Price Promissory Note. In no instance shall any payment obligation under the Redemption Price Promissory Note be accelerated except in the sole and absolute discretion of WRL or as specifi cally mandated by law. The indebtedness evidenced by the Redemption Price Promissory Note is and shall be subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Redemption Price Promissory Note, to the prior payment in full of all existing and future obligations of WRL or any of its affi liates in respect of indebtedness for borrowed money of any kind or nature.
On 19 February 2012, WRL fi led a complaint in the District Court of Clark County, Nevada against Mr. Okada, Aruze USA, Inc. and Universal Entertainment Corporation alleging breaches of fi duciary duty and related claims. On 12 March 2012, Aruze USA, Inc. and Universal Entertainment Corporation removed the action to the United States District Court for the District of Nevada. On that same date, Aruze USA, Inc. and Universal Entertainment Corporation fi led an answer denying the claims and a counterclaim that purports to assert claims against WRL, each of the members of WRL's board (other than Mr. Okada) and a senior executive of WRL. Among other relief, the
 
Annual Report 2011 57
Report of the Directors
INFORMATION CONCERNING MR. KAZUO OKADA (continued) counterclaim seeks a declaration that the redemption of Aruze USA, Inc.'s shares was void, an injunction restoring Aruze USA, Inc.'s share ownership and damages in an unspecifi ed amount.
On 24 February 2012, the Board considered the information disclosed by WRL concerning the Freeh Report. After due consideration of the Freeh Report, taking into account the Company's high ethical standards, the Board determined that it was obligated to remove Mr. Kazuo Okada as a non-executive Director given the unacceptable conduct by Mr. Okada, his employees and associates detailed in the Freeh Report. Accordingly, the Board resolved to remove Mr. Kazuo Okada as a non-executive director of the Company and Mr. Kazuo Okada was so removed ("Mr. Okada's Removal").
On 7 March 2012, WRL fi led with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement for a special meeting of stockholders of WRL to be held for the purpose of voting on a proposal to remove Mr. Okada as a director of WRL.
Litigation commenced by Mr. Okada and related matters
As previously disclosed in May 2011, the Company made a commitment to the University of Macau Development Foundation in support of the new Asia-Pacifi c Academy of Economics and Management. This contribution consists of a MOP200.0 million (equivalent to HK$194.2 million) payment made in May 2011 and a commitment for additional donations of MOP80.0 million (equivalent to HK$77.7 million) each year for the calendar years 2012 through 2022 inclusive. The pledge was consistent with WRL's long-standing practice of providing philanthropic support for deserving institutions in the markets in which it operates. The pledge was made following an extensive analysis which concluded that the gift was made in accordance with all applicable laws. The pledge was considered by the boards of directors of both WRL and the Company and approved by 15 of the 16 directors who serve on those boards. The sole dissenting vote was cast by Mr. Kazuo Okada whose stated objection was to the length of time over which the donation would occur, not its propriety.
Mr. Okada commenced litigation on 11 January 2012, in Nevada state court seeking to compel WRL to produce information relating to the donation to the University of Macau, among other things.
On 8 February 2012, following Mr. Okada's lawsuit, WRL received a letter from the Salt Lake Regional Offi ce of the SEC requesting that, in connection with an informal inquiry by the SEC, WRL preserve information relating to, but not limited to, the donation to the University of Macau, any donations by WRL to any other educational charitable institutions, including the University of Macau Development Foundation, and WRL's casino or concession gaming licenses or renewals in Macau. WRL has informed the Salt Lake Regional Offi ce that it intends to fully comply with the SEC's request.

Corporate Governance Report
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES
The Company is dedicated to maintaining and ensuring high standards of corporate governance practices and the corporate governance principles of the Company are adopted in the best interest of the Company and its Shareholders. The Company's corporate governance practices are based on the principles, code provisions and certain recommended best practices as set out in the Code on Corporate Governance Practices contained in Appendix 14 to the Listing Rules.
The Company has complied with the code provisions in the Code on Corporate Governance Practices for the year ended 31 December 2011, except for the following deviation from provision A.2.1 of the Code on Corporate Governance Practices.
Stephen A. Wynn as our Chairman and Chief Executive Offi cer
Under code provision A.2.1 of the Code, the roles of chairman and chief executive offi cer should be separate and should not be performed by the same individual. The Company does not at present separate the roles of the chairman and chief executive offi cer.
Mr. Wynn, the founder of the Company and Wynn Macau, serves as the Chairman and Chief Executive Offi cer of the Company. The Board has determined that the combination of these roles held singularly by Mr. Wynn is in the best interest of the Company and all Shareholders. The Board believes that the issue of whether to combine or separate the offi ces of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Offi cer is part of the succession planning process and that it is in the best interests of the Company for the Board to make a determination whether to combine or separate the roles based upon the circumstances. The Board has given careful consideration to separating the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Offi cer and has determined that the Company and its Shareholders are best served by the current structure. Mr. Wynn's combined role promotes unifi ed leadership and direction for the Board and executive management and allows for a single, clear focus for the Company's operational and strategic efforts.
The combined role of Mr. Wynn as both Chairman and Chief Executive Offi cer is balanced by the Company's governance structure, policies and controls. All major decisions are made in consultation with members of the Board and the relevant Board committees. The Company has three Board committees, namely the audit committee, the remuneration committee, and the nomination and corporate governance committee. Each Board committee comprises non-executive Directors only and is chaired by an independent non-executive Director. In addition, there are three independent non-executive Directors on the Board offering independent perspectives.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES (continued)
Stephen A. Wynn as our Chairman and Chief Executive Offi cer (continued)
This structure encourages independent and effective oversight of the Company's operations and prudent management of risk.
For the reasons stated above and as a result of the structure, policies and procedures outlined above, and in light of the historical success of Mr. Wynn's leadership, the Board has concluded that the current Board leadership structure is in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated fi nancial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated fi nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

1. CORPORATE INFORMATION
The Company was incorporated in the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability on 4 September 2009. The Company's Shares were listed on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 9 October 2009. The Company's registered offi ce address is P.O. Box 309, Ugland House, Grand Cayman, KY1-1104, Cayman Islands, or at such other place as the Directors may from time to time decide.
The Group owns and operates a hotel and casino resort, Wynn Macau, which conducts gaming activities in casinos in Macau under a concession contract signed with the Macau Government on 24 June 2002. The 20-year concession period commenced on 27 June 2002 and will expire on 26 June 2022.
WM Cayman Holdings Limited I owns 72.29% of the Company and 27.71% of the Company is owned by public shareholders. The ultimate parent company of Wynn Macau, Limited is Wynn Resorts, Limited, a publicly-traded company incorporated in the United States of America.
2.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION
These fi nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards which comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board (the "IASB"), International Accounting Standards and Standing Interpretation Committee interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Committee, and the applicable disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance and the Listing Rules. The fi nancial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of available-for-sale fi nancial investments and derivative fi nancial instruments which have been measured at fair value as further explained in note 2.2. These fi nancial statements are presented in Hong Kong dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (HK$'000) except when otherwise indicated.
As at 31 December 2011, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of HK$5,156.7 million derived from its ordinary business operations. These cash and cash equivalents have not been earmarked for any specifi c use other than for general corporate purposes and repayments on the Group's debt obligations.
As at 31 December 2011, the Group had a net current liability position of HK$3,023.6 million. The Group expects it will generate positive cash fl ows in 2012 and will obtain or renew its bank loan facilities, wherever needed, to meet its fi nancial liabilities as and when they fall due. The Group believes it has suffi cient working capital to fi nance its operations and fi nancial obligations.

2.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued)
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated fi nancial statements comprise the fi nancial statements of Wynn Macau, Limited and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2011. The subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group, and will continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. The fi nancial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between group companies and dividends are eliminated on consolidation in full. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
2.2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an entity whose fi nancial and operating policies the Company controls, directly or indirectly, so as to obtain benefi ts from its activities.
In the Company's statement of fi nancial position, the investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment losses. The results of subsidiaries are accounted for by the Company on the basis of dividend received and receivable.
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount recognized for non-controlling interests and any fair value of the Group's previously held equity interests in the acquiree over the identifi able net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the sum of this consideration and other items is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is, after reassessment, recognized in the statement of comprehensive income as a gain on bargain purchase.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognized in the consolidated statement of fi nancial position as an asset, initially measured at cost and subsequently at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

For the year ended 31 December 2011
2.2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Goodwill (continued)
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. The Group performs its annual impairment test of goodwill as at 31 December. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefi t from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the Group are assigned to those units or groups of units.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (group of cash-generating units) to which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (group of cash-generating units) is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit (group of cash-generating units) and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Foreign currency translation
These fi nancial statements are presented in Hong Kong dollars, which is the Company's functional and presentation currency. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the fi nancial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group's entities at their respective functional currency rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rates of exchange ruling at the statement of fi nancial position date. All differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are taken to the statement of comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. The gain or loss arising on retranslation of a non-monetary
item is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on change in fair value of the item.

2.2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The cost of an item of property and equipment comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use. Expenditures incurred after items of property and equipment have been put into operation, such as repair and maintenance costs, are recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they are incurred. When signifi cant parts of property and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group recognises such parts as individual assets with specifi c useful lives and depreciates them accordingly. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfi ed. The present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met.
Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis to write off the cost of each item of property and equipment to its residual value over the shorter of the remaining term of the gaming concession (for designated gaming assets and space) or the land concession for Wynn Macau (for all other assets), as applicable, and their estimated useful lives. The gaming concession and the land concession for Wynn Macau currently expire in June 2022 and August 2029, respectively. The estimated useful lives used for this purpose are as follows:
Buildings and improvements 10 to 25 years Furniture, fi xtures and equipment 3 to 5 years Leasehold improvements (shorter of remaining lease period 1 to 5 years and estimated useful life)
An item of property and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefi ts are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of an asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of comprehensive income when the asset is derecognized.
Residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed at each fi nancial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

2.2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Property and equipment (continued)
Construction in progress represents assets under development or construction, which are stated at cost less any impairment losses, and are not depreciated. Cost comprises the direct costs of construction and capitalized borrowing costs on related borrowed funds during the period of construction. Construction in progress is reclassifi ed to the appropriate category of property and equipment when completed and ready for use.
Leasehold interests in land
Leasehold interests in land under operating leases are payments made on entering into or acquiring land-use rights over extended periods of time. The total lease payments are amortized on the straight-line basis over the lease terms in accordance with the expected pattern of consumption of the economic benefi ts embodied in the land-use right.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are capitalized as part of the cost of the respective assets. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.
Impairment of non-fi nancial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset's recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or a cash-generating unit's (CGU) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined by individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash infl ows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash fl ows are discounted to their present value using pre-tax discount rates that refl ect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specifi c to the asset. In determining fair value less costs to sell, recent market transactions are taken into account, if available. If no such transactions can be identifi ed, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded subsidiaries or other available fair value indicators.

Financial Statements
Notes to Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2011
2.2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Impairment of non-fi nancial assets (continued)
The Group bases its impairment calculations on detailed budgets and forecast calculations which are prepared separately for each of the Group's CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of fi ve years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to projected future cash fl ows after the fi fth year.
Impairment losses of continuing operations including impairments on inventories, are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired assets.
For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the Group estimates the asset's or CGU's recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.
Investments and other fi nancial assets
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classifi ed as fi nancial assets at fair value through profi t or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, or available-for-sale fi nancial assets, as appropriate. When fi nancial assets are recognized initially, they are measured at fair value plus transaction costs, except in the case of fi nancial assets recorded at fair value through profi t or loss.
The Group determines the classifi cation of its fi nancial assets on initial recognition and, where allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each fi nancial year end.
All regular way purchases and sales of fi nancial assets are recognized on the trade date, which is the date that the Group commits to purchase the asset. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of fi nancial assets that require delivery of assets within the period generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.

2.2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative fi nancial assets with fi xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. After initial measurement, loans and receivables (including trade and other receivables, deposits, amounts due from related companies and cash and cash equivalents) are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less impairment. Gains and losses are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income when the loans and receivables are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process.
Held-to-maturity investments
Non-derivative fi nancial assets with fi xed or determinable payments and fi xed maturity are classifi ed as held-to-maturity when the Group has the positive intention and ability to hold them to maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are initially recognized on the settlement date and are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate amortization is included in fi nance revenues in the statement of comprehensive income. The loss arising from impairment is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in other operating expenses.
Available-for-sale fi nancial investments
Available-for-sale fi nancial investments are non-derivative fi nancial assets in listed and unlisted debt securities. Debt securities in this category are those which are intended to be held for an indefi nite period of time and which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or in response to changes in market conditions.
After initial recognition, available-for-sale fi nancial investments are subsequently measured at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses recognized as other comprehensive income in the available-for-sale investment revaluation reserve until the investment is derecognized, at which time the cumulative gain or loss is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income, or until the investment is determined to be impaired, when the cumulative gain or loss reclassifi ed from the available-for-sale investment revaluation reserve to the statement of comprehensive income in other expenses. Interest earned while holding the available-for-sale fi nancial investments is reported as fi nance revenue in the statement of comprehensive income in accordance with the policy set out for "Revenue recognition" below.

2.2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Impairment of fi nancial assets
The Group assesses at each statement of fi nancial position date whether there is any objective evidence that a fi nancial asset or a group of fi nancial assets is impaired.
Assets carried at amortized cost
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on assets carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash fl ows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the fi nancial asset's original effective interest rate (i.e., the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the estimated impairment loss decreases because of an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss is increased or reduced by adjusting the allowance account. If a future write-off is later recovered, the recovery is credited to fi nance costs in the statement of comprehensive income.
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or signifi cant fi nancial diffi culties of the debtor) that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the transaction. The carrying amount of the receivables is reduced through the use of an allowance account. Impaired debts are derecognized when they are assessed as uncollectible.
Available-for-sale fi nancial investments
For available-for-sale fi nancial investments, the Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that an investment or a group of investments is impaired.
If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment and amortization) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognized in the statement of comprehensive income, is removed from other comprehensive income and recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.

2.2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Impairment of fi nancial assets (continued)
Available-for-sale fi nancial investments (continued)
In the case of debt instruments classifi ed as available-for-sale, impairment is assessed based on the same criteria as fi nancial assets carried at amortized cost. However, the amount recorded for impairment is the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the amortized cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that
investment previously recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. Future interest income continues to be accrued based on the reduced carrying amount of the asset and is accrued using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash fl ows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss. The interest income is recorded as part of fi nance revenue. Impairment losses on debt instruments are reversed through the statement of comprehensive income if the increase in fair value of the instruments can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined on the fi rst-in, fi rst-out, average or specifi c identifi cation methods. Net realizable value is based on estimated selling prices less estimated costs to be incurred on completion and disposal.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of fi nancial position comprise cash at banks and on hand and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash fl ows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defi ned above.
Financial liabilities
The Group's and the Company's fi nancial liabilities are generally classifi ed as other fi nancial liabilities, which include accounts payable, other payables, amounts due to related companies, interest-bearing bank loans, and other current and long-term liabilities, and are subsequently measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognized at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs, and have not been designated as "fair value through profi t or loss".

After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Gains and losses are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the effective interest rate method ("EIR") amortization process.
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in fi nance costs in the statement of comprehensive income.
Derivative fi nancial instruments
The Group uses derivative fi nancial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage risks associated with interest rate fl uctuations. Such derivative fi nancial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. The Group adjusts this amount by applying a non-performance valuation after considering the Group's creditworthiness or the creditworthiness of the Group's counterparties at each settlement date. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. All gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives are taken directly to the statement of comprehensive income as none of the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by using appropriate valuation techniques.
Current versus non-current classifi cation
Derivative instruments that are not designated as effective hedging instruments are classifi ed as current or non-current, or are separated into a current or a non-current portion, based on an assessment of the facts and circumstances (i.e. the underlying contracted cash fl ows).

2.2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Derecognition of fi nancial assets and liabilities
Financial assets
A fi nancial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a fi nancial asset or part of a group of similar fi nancial assets) is derecognized when:
 -  the rights to receive cash fl ows from the asset have expired; or
 -  the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash fl ows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay cash fl ow receipts in full without material delay to a third party under a "pass-through" arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash fl ows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risk and rewards of ownership of the asset. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognized to the extent of the Group's continuing involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.
When continuing involvement takes the form of a written and/or purchased option (including a cash settled option or similar provision) on the transferred asset, the extent of the Group's continuing involvement is the amount of the transferred asset that the Group may repurchase, except that in the case of a written put option (including a cash settled option or similar provision) on an asset measured at fair value, the extent of the Group's continuing involvement is limited to the lower of the fair value of the transferred asset and the option exercise price.
Financial liabilities
A fi nancial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled, or expires. When an existing fi nancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modifi ed, such an exchange or modifi cation is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.

2.2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outfl ow of resources embodying economic benefi ts will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that refl ects, where appropriate, the risks specifi c to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a fi nance cost.
Pensions and other post employment benefi ts
The Group operates a defi ned contribution retirement benefi t scheme (the "Scheme"). The Scheme allows eligible employees to contribute 5% of their salary to the Scheme and the Group matches the contributions with an equal amount. The assets of the Scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund. The Group's matching contributions vest to the employees at 10% per year with full vesting in ten years. Forfeitures of unvested contributions are used to reduce the Group's liability for its contributions payable under the Scheme. The contributions are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the Scheme.
Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including senior executives and directors) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments in the form of common shares of the ultimate parent company, Wynn Resorts, Limited, or beginning in September 2009, the Company.
In situations where equity instruments are issued and some or all of the goods or services received by the entity as consideration cannot be specifi cally identifi ed, they are measured as the difference between the fair value of the share-based payment transaction and the fair value of any identifi able goods or services received at the grant date. This is then capitalized or expensed as appropriate.

2.2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Share-based payment transactions (continued)
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees, for awards granted after 7 November 2002, is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. The fair value is determined by using an appropriate pricing model, further details of which are given in note 23.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognized, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfi lled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (the "vesting date"). The cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date refl ects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The charge or credit to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognized as of the beginning and end of that period and is recognized in staff costs.
No expense is recognized for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for equity-settled transactions where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfi ed, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfi ed.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modifi ed, the minimum expense recognized is the expense as if the terms had not been modifi ed, if the original terms of the award are met. An additional expense is recognized for any modifi cation that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transactions, or is otherwise benefi cial to the employee as measured at the date of modifi cation.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognized for the award is recognized immediately. This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of either the entity or the employee are not met. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modifi cation of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph. All cancellations of equity-settled transaction awards are treated equally.

Share-based payment transactions (continued)
Equity-settled transactions (continued)
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is refl ected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at its inception and whether the fulfi llment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specifi c asset or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
Group as a lessee
Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefi ts of ownership of the asset are classifi ed as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognized as an operating expense in the statement of comprehensive income on the straight-line basis over the lease terms.
Group as a lessor
When an asset is leased out under an operating lease, the asset is included in the statement of fi nancial position based on the nature of the asset. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognized as revenue in the period in which they are earned.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable the economic benefi ts will fl ow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defi ned terms of payment and excluding taxes or duties.
Casino revenues are measured by the aggregate net difference between gaming wins and losses, with liabilities recognized for funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs and for chips in customers' possession. Revenues are recognized net of certain sales incentives. Accordingly, the Group's casino revenues are reduced by discounts, commissions and points earned in customer loyalty programs.

Taxes
Current income tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amounts expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of fi nancial position date.
Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the statement of fi nancial position date between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for fi nancial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except:
 -  when the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profi t nor taxable profi t or loss; and
 -  in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, when the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profi t will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized, except:
 -  when the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profi t nor taxable profi t or loss; and

Deferred income tax (continued)
 -  in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profi ts will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each statement of fi nancial position date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that suffi cient taxable profi ts will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each statement of fi nancial position date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profi ts will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of fi nancial position date. Deferred income tax items are recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Gaming taxes and premiums
According to the gaming concession granted by the Macau government and the relevant legislation, the Group is required to pay a 35% gaming tax on the gross gaming win. The Group is also required to pay an additional 4% of gross gaming win as public development and social related contributions. The Group also makes certain variable and fi xed payments to the Macau government based on the number of slot machines and table games in operation on a monthly and yearly basis, respectively. These expenses are reported as "gaming taxes and premiums" in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

A diamond and fi ne art
The Group's diamond and fi ne art are stated at cost less accumulated impairment. The amount represents the aggregate cost of a diamond and artwork. Any diamond and artwork impairment is assessed based on the cash-generating unit to which it belongs, which is usually the property in its entirety. No impairment has been recognized for the diamond or artwork for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010.
Dividends
Final dividends proposed by the directors are classifi ed as a separate allocation of retained earnings within the equity section of the statement of fi nancial position, until they have been approved by the shareholders in a general meeting. When these dividends have been approved by the shareholders and declared, they are recognized as a liability.
Interim/special dividends are simultaneously proposed and declared because the Company's memorandum and articles of association grant the Directors the authority to declare interim/ special dividends. Consequently, interim/special dividends are recognized immediately as a liability when they are proposed and declared.
Statutory reserve
In accordance with the provisions of the Macau Commercial Code, Wynn Macau, Limited's subsidiaries incorporated in Macau are required to transfer a minimum of 10% of their annual net profi t to a legal reserve until that reserve equals 25% of their initial capital. This reserve is not distributable to the shareholders.

REPORTING STANDARDS (continued)
The Group has not early adopted any of the above standards, interpretations and amendments to the existing standards, and continues to assess the impact of these new and revised IFRSs on the Group's results of operations, fi nancial position, and its fi nancial reporting disclosures. While the adoption of some of the amendments and the new and revised IFRSs may result in change in accounting policies and new disclosure, none of these are expected to have a signifi cant fi nancial impact on the Group.
2.5 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of the Group's fi nancial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the reporting date. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates may result in outcomes that may require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in the future. Key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments in applying the Group's accounting policies which have a signifi cant effect on the fi nancial statements are set out below.
Useful lives of property and equipment
The useful lives of assets are based on management's estimations. Management considers the impact of changes in technology, customer service requirements, availability of capital funding and the required return on assets and equity to determine the optimum useful life expectation for each of the individual categories of property, plant, and equipment. The estimations of residual values of assets are also based on management's judgments whether the assets will be sold or used to the end of their useful lives and what their condition will be like at that time. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis to write off the cost of each item of property and equipment to its residual value over the shorter of the remaining term of the gaming concession (for designated gaming assets and space) or land concession (for all other assets), as applicable, and their estimated useful lives. Management's periodic reviews on the estimations made could result in changes in depreciable lives and, therefore, depreciation expense in future periods.

For the year ended 31 December 2011
2.5 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES (continued)
Impairment of non-fi nancial assets
Management is required to make judgments concerning the cause, timing and amount of impairments. In the identifi cation of impairment indicators, management considers the impact of changes in current competitive conditions, cost of capital, availability of funding, technological obsolescence, discontinuance of services and other circumstances that could indicate that an impairment exists. The Group applies the impairment assessment to its separate CGUs. This requires management to make signifi cant judgments concerning the existence of impairment indicators, identifi cation of separate CGU's remaining useful lives of assets and estimates of projected cash fl ows and fair value less costs to sell. For non-fi nancial assets other than goodwill, management's judgment is also required when assessing whether a previously recognized impairment loss should be reversed. Where impairment indicators exist, the determination of the recoverable amount of a CGU requires management to make assumptions to determine the fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In addition, for goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated annually whether or not there is any indication of impairment.
Key assumptions on which management has based its determination of fair value less costs to sell include the existence of binding sale agreements, and for the determination of value in use include projected revenues, gross margins, and average revenue per asset component, capital expenditures, expected customer base and market share. Management is also required to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash fl ows. Changes in key assumptions on which the recoverable amount of the assets is based could signifi cantly affect the Group's fi nancial condition and results of operations.
Impairment of accounts receivable
Management evaluates the reserve for bad debts based on a specifi c review of customer accounts as well as experience with collection trends in the casino industry and current economic and business conditions. As customer payment experience evolves, management will continue to refi ne the estimated reserve for bad debts. Accordingly, the associated provision for doubtful accounts charge may fl uctuate. Because individual customer account balances can be signifi cant, the reserve and the provision can change signifi cantly
between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region's economy or legal systems occur.

2.5 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES (continued)
Segment reporting
The Group currently operates in one business segment, namely, the management of its casino and hotel resort. A single management team reports to the chief operating decision-maker who comprehensively manages the entire business. Accordingly, the Group does not have separate reportable segments.
Fair value estimation  fi nancial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are recognized or disclosed at fair values. The fair value of fi nancial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices. In assessing the fair value of non-traded instruments, discounted cash fl ows or market assessments are used. The nominal values less any estimated credit realizable value adjustments for fi nancial assets and liabilities with a maturity of less than one year, including prepayments, other payables or current borrowings, are assumed to approximate their fair values. Management determines these assumptions by reviewing current market rates, making industry comparisons and reviewing conditions relevant to the Group.
Fair value estimation  Black-Scholes valuation model
The Group uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to value Wynn Resorts, Limited's and Wynn Macau, Limited's grants of options issued. The Black-Scholes valuation model uses assumptions of expected volatility, risk-free interest rates, the expected terms of options granted, and expected rates of dividends. Changes in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value. Expected volatility is based on implied and historical factors related to Wynn Resorts, Limited's and Wynn Macau, Limited's common stock. Expected term represents the weighted average time between the option's grant date and its exercise date. The risk-free interest rate used is equal to the U.S. Treasury yield curve and the Hong Kong Exchange Fund Bills for the WRL Stock Plan and Wynn Macau, Limited's Share Option Scheme, respectively, at the time of grant for the period equal to the expected term.
Income taxes
Income taxes represent the sum of income taxes currently payable and any deferred taxes. The calculation of deferred income taxes and any associated allowance is subject to a signifi cant amount of judgment. The Group's income tax reports may be examined by governmental authorities. Accordingly, the Group reviews any potentially unfavorable tax outcome and, when an unfavorable outcome is identifi ed as probable and can be reasonably estimated, an allowance is established.

"Property charges and other" includes a donation made by the Group to the University of Macau Development Foundation (the "Foundation"). In May 2011, the Group entered into an agreement with the Foundation to donate a certain amount to the Foundation with the primary purpose of supporting the creation, promotion, operation and other activities related to the Asia-Pacifi c Academy of Economics and Management created by the University of Macau. Under such agreement, the Group donated MOP200.0 million (approximately HK$194.2 million) in May 2011 and for each of the years from 2012 through 2022 the Group will donate MOP80.0 million (approximately HK$77.7 million). As a result of the above arrangement, the Group recognized approximately HK$831.1 million representing the present value of the donation as an expense for the year ended 31 December 2011. No such arrangement existed for the year ended 31 December 2010.
Asset abandonment losses related to property and equipment and construction in progress abandoned as a result of renovating certain assets of Wynn Macau in response to customer preferences and changes in market demand.

4. INTEREST RATE SWAPS
As at 31 December 2011, the Group had one interest rate swap agreement. Under this swap agreement, the Group paid a fi xed interest rate of 2.15% on borrowings of approximately HK$2.3 billion incurred under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities in exchange for receipts on the same amount at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. As at 31 December 2011, this interest rate swap fi xed the interest rate on HK$2.3 billion of borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities at approximately 3.4% (2010: 3.4%). This interest rate swap agreement will terminate in June 2012.

For the year ended 31 December 2011
4. INTEREST RATE SWAPS (continued)
The Group had two additional interest rate swap agreements that terminated in August 2011. Under the fi rst of these swap agreements, the Group paid a fi xed interest rate of 3.632% on U.S. dollar borrowings of approximately US$153.8 million (approximately HK$1.2 billion) incurred under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities in exchange for receipts on the same amount at a variable interest rate based on the applicable LIBOR at the time of payment. Under the second swap agreement, the Group paid a fi xed interest rate of 3.39% on Hong Kong dollar borrowings of approximately HK$991.6 million incurred under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities in exchange for receipts on the same amount at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. These interest rate swaps fi xed the interest rates on the U.S. dollar and the Hong Kong dollar borrowings at approximately 4.88% to 5.38% and 4.64%, respectively, in 2010 and until their maturity in 2011.
The carrying value of the interest rate swap in the consolidated statement of fi nancial position approximates its fair value. The fair value approximates the amount that the Group would pay if the contract was settled at the valuation date. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instrument and other market conditions and, therefore, is subject to signifi cant estimation and a high degree of variability of fl uctuation between periods. The Group adjusts this amount by applying a non-performance valuation, considering its creditworthiness or the creditworthiness of its counterparties at the settlement date, as applicable. This transaction does not qualify for hedge accounting. Accordingly, changes in the fair value during the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010, were charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The Group's liabilities under the swap agreement are secured by the same collateral package securing the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.

5. INCOME TAX BENEFIT (EXPENSE) (continued)
The Group incurred Macau tax losses of approximately HK$509.7 million, HK$695.1 million and HK$576.6 million during the tax years ended 31 December 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. These tax losses will expire in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. As at 31 December 2011, the Group's deferred tax assets relating to the University of Macau Development Foundation contribution, interest rate swaps, executive compensation, fi xed assets and tax loss carryforwards amounting to HK$277.7 million were not recognized as the Group determined it was not probable that future taxable profi ts will be available against which the deferred tax asset could be utilized. As at 31 December 2010, the Group had not recognized deferred tax assets relating to pre-opening expenses, interest rate swaps, executive compensation, fi xed assets and tax loss carryforwards amounting to HK$276.2 million for similar reasons.
Effective 6 September 2006, WRM received a 5-year exemption from Macau's 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profi ts (the "Tax Holiday"). On 30 November 2010, WRM received an additional 5-year exemption effective from 1 January 2011 through 31 December 2015. Accordingly, the Group was exempted from the payment of approximately HK$641.4 million in such tax for the year ended 31 December 2011 (2010: HK$499.2 million). The Group's non-gaming profi ts remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and its casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming Tax and other levies in accordance with its Concession Agreement.
In June 2009, WRM entered into an agreement, effective retroactively to 2006, with the Macau Special Administrative Region that provided for annual payments of MOP7.2 million (approximately HK$7.0 million) to the Macau Special Administrative Region in lieu of Complementary Tax on dividend distributions to its shareholders from gaming profi ts. The term of this agreement was fi ve years, which coincided with the Tax Holiday which began in 2006. In November 2010, WRM applied for a 5-year extension of this agreement. In August 2011, the 5-year extension was granted with an annual payment of MOP15.5 million (approximately HK$15.0 million) due to the Macau Special Administration Region for each of the years 2011 through 2015.

5. INCOME TAX BENEFIT (EXPENSE) (continued)
The Group is exempted from income tax in the Isle of Man and the Cayman Islands. The Group's subsidiaries fi le income tax returns in Macau and various foreign jurisdictions as required by law. The Group's income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in the locations where it operates. The Group's 2007 to 2010 Macau income tax returns remain subject to examination by the Macau Finance Bureau. In 2011, the Group received the results of the Macau Finance Bureau's examination of its 2006 and 2007 Macau Complementary Tax returns. During July 2011, the Group fi led an appeal of the examinations fi ndings. The Macau Finance Bureau accepted the Group's objection and the Group paid an additional tax payment of HK$8.5 million substantially all of which was provided for in prior years.
Quarterly, the Group reviews any potentially unfavorable tax outcomes and when an unfavorable outcome is identifi ed as being probable and can be reasonably estimated, the Group then establishes a tax reserve for such possible unfavorable outcome. Estimating potential tax outcomes for any uncertain tax issues is highly judgmental and may not be indicative of the ultimate settlement with the tax authorities. With respect to these items, as at 31 December 2010, the Group has provided a reserve of HK$41.9 million and included this amount in "other long-term liabilities" with the corresponding charge to current income tax expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The period of assessment for the Group's Macau Complimentary Tax returns for the years ended 31 December 2006 and before has closed. Accordingly, as of 31 December 2011, the Group reversed a reserve of HK$41.9 million previously established for these years. As of 31 December 2011, the Group has unrecognized tax losses and the Group believes that these unrecognized tax losses are adequate to offset adjustments that might be proposed by the Macau tax authorities. The Group believes that it has adequately provided reasonable reserves for prudent and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters.

9. LEASEHOLD INTERESTS IN LAND
The Group has the leasing rights for certain land in Macau under a 25-year concession, which expires in August 2029, granted by the Macau government in return for the payment of premiums by installments bearing interest at 5% per annum. All installments were satisfi ed before 31 December 2009.
In 2011, the Group formally accepted the draft terms and conditions of a 25-year land concession from the Macau government for certain land in Cotai ("Cotai Land").

In September 2004, the Group acquired all of the 17.5% indirect ownership interests in WRM held by third parties, in exchange for 1,333,333 shares of Wynn Resorts, Limited's common stock. Mr. Wong Chi Seng, one of the third parties, retained a direct 10% voting and social interest in WRM and agreed to continue to serve as Executive Director. The acquired shares provide, in aggregate, a nominal preferential annual dividend and capital distribution rights of up to one Macau pataca. As a result of the acquisition, WRM became an indirectly wholly owned subsidiary of the Group.
In accordance with the Group's accounting policy for the acquisition of non-controlling interests, the assets and liabilities of WRM were not restated to refl ect their fair values at the date of the acquisition. The difference between the purchase price and the minorities' share of the assets and liabilities refl ected within the consolidated statement of fi nancial position of HK$398.3 million at the date of the acquisition was recorded as goodwill.
The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit ("CGU") has been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use pre-tax cash fl ow projections based on fi nancial budgets approved by management covering a fi ve-year period. Management determined the fi nancial budgets based on past performance and its expectations for market development. Cash fl ows beyond the fi ve-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rate stated below.
The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations are as follows:
2011 2010
Growth rate (i) 3% 3%
Discount rate (ii) 1.6% 1.9%
Notes:
(i) Weighted average growth rate is used to extrapolate cash fl ows beyond the budget period which does not exceed the historical trend of the CGUs. The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
(ii) Pre-tax discount rate has been applied to the cash fl ow projections. The discount rates used are pre-tax and refl ect specifi c risks relating to the Group.

Originally, the Group's investments were classifi ed as held-to-maturity because the Group had the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity. However, during the third quarter of 2011, due to the economic uncertainty in the global fi nancial markets, the Group has reassessed the intention to hold the investments to maturity and changed the classifi cation of its entire investments with a carrying value amounting to Offshore RMB427.9 million (approximately HK$524.5 million) from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale.
The Company obtains pricing information in determining the fair values of its listed and unlisted available-for-sale debt securities from independent pricing vendors. Based on management's inquiries, the pricing vendors use various pricing models consistent with what other market participants would use.

As amended on 27 June 2007, the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities total US$1.55 billion (approximately HK$12.1 billion), in a combination of Hong Kong and U.S. dollars, including a US$550 million (approximately HK$4.3 billion), fully-funded senior term loan (known as the "WRM Term Loan"), and a US$1 billion (approximately HK$7.8 billion) revolving credit facility (known as the "WRM Revolver"). The WRM Term Loan is comprised of two individual facilities, a Hotel Facility and a Project Facility, each containing U.S. dollar and HK dollar tranches. The Hotel Facility is separated into Tranche A (US$10,250,000) and Tranche B (HK$639,600,000). The Project Facility is separated into Tranche A (US$18,500,000), Tranche B (HK$2,451,150,000) and Tranche C (US$125,000,000). The WRM Revolver is also comprised of two individual facilities, a Hotel Facility and a Project Facility, each containing U.S. dollar and HK dollar tranches. The Project Facility is separated into Tranche A (US$258,000,000) and Tranche B (HK$4,516,200,000). The Hotel Facility is separated into Tranche C (US$13,000,000) and Tranche D (HK$1,170,000,000). The Group also has the ability to upsize the total secured facilities by an additional US$50 million (approximately HK$389 million) pursuant to the terms and provisions of the agreements. The senior credit facilities described in this paragraph are collectively referred to herein as the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.

20. INTEREST-BEARING BANK LOANS (continued)
The WRM Term Loan of approximately HK$3.7 billion as at 31 December 2011 matures in June 2014, and the WRM Revolver of approximately HK$1.2 billion as at 31 December 2011 matures in June 2012. The principal amount of the WRM Term Loan is required to be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing in September 2011. Borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities bear interest at LIBOR or HIBOR plus a margin of 1.75% through 30 September 2010. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2010, the WRM Revolver, the WRM Term Loan Hotel Facility and the WRM Term Loan Project Facility Tranches A and B are subject to a margin of 1.25% to 2.00% depending on the Group's leverage ratio at the end of each quarter. The WRM Term Loan Project Facility Tranche C remains subject to a margin of 1.75%. As at 31 December 2011, the weighted average margin was 1.29%.
Collateral for the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities consists of substantially all of the assets of the Group. In addition, the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities agreement contains affi rmative and negative covenants which impose various obligations and restrictions on Wynn Macau, and in some cases, the Group.
The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain customary covenants restricting certain activities including, but not limited to: the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the incurrence or creation of liens on any of its property, sales and leaseback transactions, the ability to dispose of assets, and make loans or other investments. In addition, the Group is required by the agreement to maintain a Leverage Ratio, as defi ned, of not greater than 3.50 to 1 as at 31 December 2011, and an Interest Coverage Ratio, as defi ned, of not less than 2 to 1. Management believes that the Group was in compliance with all covenants as at 31 December 2011. Going forward, the Group is required to maintain a Leverage Ratio not greater than 3.50 to 1 and an Interest Coverage Ratio not less than 2 to 1 for all 2012 reporting periods.
Additionally, the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain a requirement that the Group must make mandatory prepayments of indebtedness from specifi ed percentages of excess cash fl ow. If WRM meets a Leverage Ratio, as defi ned, of greater than 4 to 1 at any reporting period, such required prepayment is 50% of Excess Cash Flow, as defi ned. If the Leverage Ratio is less than 4 to 1 at any reporting period, then no prepayment is required. Based on current estimates, the Group does not believe that the Wynn Macau Leverage Ratio during the fi scal year ending
31 December 2012 will exceed 4 to 1. Accordingly, the Group does not expect to make any mandatory prepayments pursuant to this requirement during 2012.

20. INTEREST-BEARING BANK LOANS (continued)
In connection with the initial fi nancing of Wynn Macau, the Group entered into a bank guarantee reimbursement agreement with Banco Nacional Ultramarino, S.A. ("BNU") to secure a guarantee currently in the amount of MOP300 million (approximately HK$291.3 million) until 180 days after the end of the term of the Concession Agreement. This guarantee, which is for the benefi t of the Macau government, assures certain aspects of the Group's performance under the Concession Agreement, including the payment of premiums, fi nes and indemnities for any material failures to perform under the terms of the Concession Agreement. BNU, as issuer of the guarantee, is currently secured by a second priority security interest in the senior lender collateral package. After repayment of all indebtedness under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, the Group is obligated to promptly, upon demand by BNU, repay any claim made on the guarantee by the Macau government. The Group currently paid BNU an annual fee for the guarantee not exceeding approximately MOP5.2 million (approximately HK$5 million).
As at 31 December 2011, the Group had HK$6.6 billion available under the WRM Revolver facilities. Subsequent to year end, the remaining balance of the Wynn Macau Revolver amounting to approximately HK$1.2 billion was fully repaid by March 2012.
Fair value of debt
The estimated fair value of the Group's outstanding debt instruments was approximately HK$4.7 billion (2010: HK$4.7 billion) with a book value of HK$4.9 billion (2010: HK$5.0 billion) at the reporting date.

22. SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT AND RESERVES (continued)
The Company's reserves available for distribution represent the share premium account, available-for-sale investments revaluation reserve, share option reserve and retained earnings. Under the Companies Law (Revised) Chapter 22 of the Cayman Islands, the share premium of the Company is available for paying distributions or dividends to shareholders subject to the provisions of its Memorandum or Articles of Association and provided that immediately following the distribution of a dividend, the Company is able to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, the Company's reserves available for distribution to shareholders as at 31 December 2011 amounted to approximately HK$14.2 billion (2010: HK$12.7 billion).
23. SHARE-BASED PAYMENT PLAN
The Company's share option scheme
The Company established a share option scheme on 16 September 2009 with the purpose of rewarding participants, which may include Directors and employees of the Group, who have contributed to the Group and to encourage them to work towards enhancing the value of the Company and its Shares for the benefi t of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole. Under the rules of the share option scheme, the maximum number of Shares which can be issued upon exercise of all options granted under the share option scheme and of the Company shall not, in the absence of shareholders' approval, in aggregate exceed 10% in nominal amount of the aggregate of Shares in issue on the date of the listing of the Shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (the "Scheme Mandate Limit"); and the Scheme Mandate Limit may be renewed subject to Shareholders' approval. A maximum of 518.75 million shares (2010: 518.75 million shares) have been reserved for issuance under the share option scheme. The options granted under the share option scheme do not give immediate ownership of the underlying Shares as they require payment of a subscription price which is based on the then prevailing market price of the Shares.

directors and independent contractors or consultants of Wynn Resorts, Limited and its
subsidiaries, including the Group. However, only employees are eligible to receive incentive
stock options.
A maximum of 12,750,000 shares (31 December 2010: 12,750,000 shares) of Wynn Resorts,
Limited's common stock have been reserved for issuance under the WRL Stock Plan. As at 31

The total intrinsic value of the options exercised for the year ended 31 December 2011 was
HK$48.9 million (2010: HK$57.7 million). Approximately HK$112.3 million of unamortized

24. PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS
In April 2005, the Group established a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme (the
"Scheme"). The Scheme allows eligible employees to contribute 5% of their salary to the
Scheme and the Group matches the contributions with an equal amount. The assets of the
Scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund.
The Group's matching contributions vest to the employees at 10% per year with full vesting
in ten years. Forfeitures of unvested contributions are used to reduce the Group's liability for
its contributions payable under the Scheme. In May 2010, the Group reinstated matching the
contributions with an amount equal to the employee contributions after stopping the matching
contributions in March 2009. The Group recorded an expense for matching contributions of
approximately HK$51.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 (2010: HK$25.4 million).

high-end retailers. These non-cancelable leases typically contain provisions for minimum rentals
plus additional rent based upon the net sales of the retailers. The Group recorded contingent
rental income under operating leases of approximately HK$525.8 million for the year ended 31
December 2011 (2010: HK$293.2 million).

The operating lease rentals of certain retailers are based on the higher of a fixed rental and
contingent rent based on the sales of the retailers pursuant to the terms and conditions as
set out in the respective rental agreements. As the future sales of these retailers could not be
estimated reliably, only the minimum lease commitments, and not the contingent rents, have
been included in the above table.

27. RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURES (continued)
Notes:
(i) Royalty fees
Prior to Listing, WRM had an arrangement with Wynn Resorts, Limited and Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLC (together, the "Licensors") under which the Licensors licensed to WRM certain trademarks and service marks, other marks and works, domain names, and hotel casino design, development and management know-how (collectively, the "Intellectual Property Rights"). On 19 September 2009, each of the Company and WRM entered into an intellectual property license agreement with the Licensors (together, the "IP License Arrangement"), which has a perpetual term. Pursuant to the IP License Arrangement, the Licensors licensed to each of the Company and WRM the right to use the Intellectual Property Rights using the same pricing basis as described below. The IP License Arrangement is also subject to restrictions in the agreements between Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLC or Wynn Resorts, Limited and any third parties, including Mr. Stephen A. Wynn, in respect of a third party's intellectual property, including any applicable limitations on the scope of the license, limitations on sub-licensing, termination (including change of control) under certain circumstances and other standard provisions.
The license fees payable to Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLC equal the greater of (1) 3% of the IP gross monthly revenues, and (2) US$1.5 million (approximately HK$11.6 million) per month. For the purposes of each intellectual property license agreement, the term "IP gross revenues" refers to the licensee's total operating revenues as adjusted by adding back (1) commissions and discounts which were netted against operating revenues, and (2) promotional allowances, and the term "IP gross monthly revenues" refers to the licensee's IP gross revenues accrued at the end of each calendar month. The calculation of each licensee's operating revenues, promotional allowances, and commissions and discounts in connection with the IP gross revenues stated in the intellectual property license agreements shall always be consistent with the Group's accounting policies and prepared in accordance with IFRSs as in effect from 31 December 2008. If any other subsidiary of the Company (other than WRM) acquires the Intellectual Property Rights under the intellectual property license agreement between the Company and the Licensors, "IP gross revenues" and "IP monthly gross revenues" will be interpreted to include the gross revenues of such relevant subsidiary.
The following table presents a reconciliation of total operating revenues (as reported in the these fi nancial statements) to WRM's IP gross revenues as used for the purposes of the IP License Arrangement between WRM and the Licensors.

actual proportion of Wynn Resorts, Limited's annual corporate departments' costs (including salaries and
benefits for such employees during the period in which such services are rendered) and overhead expense
related to the provision of such services and, in any event, such annual fees shall not exceed 50% of the
aggregate annual corporate departments' costs and overhead expenses incurred by Wynn Resorts, Limited
during any financial year.
Similarly, WML and WRM had reciprocal arrangements to allow Wynn Resorts, Limited or its subsidiaries
(other than the Group) to have access to the services of any of the Group's employees provided that such
services do not materially interfere with such employees' obligations to, and responsibilities with, the
Group. For services provided by the Group's employees, Wynn Resorts, Limited shall pay for the services
based on an actual cost (including salaries and benefits for such employees during the period when such
services are being rendered) and expenses on a reimbursement basis.

Resorts, Limited and its subsidiaries (other than the Group) at hourly rates set by Las Vegas Jet, LLC, a

Home purchase
In May 2010, Worldwide Wynn entered into a new employment agreement with Linda Chen, who is also a director of Wynn Macau, Limited and Wynn Resorts, Limited. The term of the new employment agreement is through 24 February 2020. Under the terms of the new employment agreement, Worldwide Wynn caused Wynn Macau to purchase a house in Macau for use by Ms. Chen and will also provide Ms. Chen with the use of an automobile in Macau. Ms. Chen shall have the option to purchase the house and it is exercisable for (a) no consideration at the end of the 10-year term, (b) US$1.00 in the event of termination of Ms. Chen's employment without "cause" or termination of Ms. Chen's employment for "good reason" following a "change of control", and (c) at a price based on a percentage of the fair market value of the house that is reduced by ten percent per year during the term of the agreement (the "Discount Percentage") in the event Ms. Chen terminates the employment agreement due to material breach by Worldwide Wynn. Upon Ms. Chen's termination for "cause", Ms. Chen will be deemed to have elected to purchase the Macau house based on the applicable Discount Percentage unless Worldwide Wynn determines not to require Ms. Chen to purchase the house. If Ms. Chen's employment terminates for any other reason before the expiration of the term (e.g., because of her death or disability or due to revocation of the gaming license), the option will terminate. As at 31 December 2011, the net carrying amount of the house together with improvements and its land lease right was HK$58.6 million (2010: HK$44.6 million).

28. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The Group's principal fi nancial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, accounts payable and other payables. The main purpose of these fi nancial liabilities is to fi nance the Group's construction activities and its operations. The Group has various fi nancial assets such as trade receivables and cash and deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps contracts. The purpose is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Group's operations and its
sources of fi nance. It is, and has been throughout 2011 and 2010, the Group's policy that no trading in derivatives should be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group's fi nancial instruments are cash fl ow interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risks. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarized below.
 
152 Wynn Macau, Limited
Financial Statements
Notes to Financial Statements
 
For the year ended 31 December 2011
28. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (continued)
Interest rate risk
The Group's primary exposure is changes in market interest rates associated with its bank loans that bear interest based on variable rates. The Group attempts to manage interest rate risk by managing the mix of long-term fi xed rate borrowings and variable rate borrowings, and through interest rate swap arrangements. These risk management strategies may not always have the desired effect, and interest rate fl uctuations could have a negative impact on the results of operations.
Interest rate sensitivity
As at 31 December 2011 and 2010, all of the interest-bearing loans and borrowings were variable rate borrowings based on LIBOR or HIBOR plus a margin. However, the Group has entered into interest rate swaps that effectively fi x the interest rate for approximately 48% of the interest-bearing loans in 2011 (2010: 89%). Based on borrowings at 31 December 2011, an assumed 1% change in the variable rates would cause the annual interest expenses, without adjusting for any amounts to be capitalized, to change by HK$25.5 million (2010: HK$5.5 million).
Foreign currency risk
The fi nancial statements of foreign operations are translated into Hong Kong dollars, the Company and the Group's presentation currency, for incorporation into the consolidated fi nancial statements. Assets and liabilities are translated at the prevailing foreign exchange rates in effect at the statement of fi nancial position date. Income, expenditure and cash fl ow items are measured at the actual foreign exchange rates or average foreign exchange rates for the period. The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years. However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca to the U.S. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to, among other things, changes in governmental policies and international economic and political developments. In particular, the Company and the Group are exposed to foreign exchange risks arising primarily with respect to the Offshore RMB, which does not have pegged exchange linkages to the U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar or Macau pataca.

For the year ended 31 December 2011
28. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (continued)
Foreign currency sensitivity
As at 31 December 2011 and 2010, the Group was in a net liability position where the Group had more liabilities than assets that were denominated in U.S. dollars. Based on the liability position at 31 December 2011, an assumed 1% increase or decrease in the value of the Hong Kong dollar against the U.S. dollar would cause the Group to recognize a gain or loss of HK$13.8 million (2010: HK$10.5 million). As for Offshore RMB, the Company and the Group was in a net asset position where the Company and the Group had more assets than liabilities that were denominated in Offshore RMB. Based on the asset position at 31 December 2011, an assumed 1% increase or decrease in the value of the Hong Kong dollar against the Offshore RMB would cause the Company and the Group to recognize a loss or gain of HK$15.9 million (2010:nil).
Credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of casino accounts receivable and available-for-sale investments.
The Group issues credit in the form of markers to approved casino customers following investigations of creditworthiness. The Group maintains strict control over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursues collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances on a timely basis. These collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies, and litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in Macau, however, markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some other countries. The collectibility of markers given to foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers' home countries.
Further quantitative data in respect of the Group's exposure to credit risk arising from trade and other receivables are disclosed in note 15 to the fi nancial statements.
For the debt securities classifi ed as available-for-sale investments, the maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is the carrying value as disclosed in note 11 to the fi nancial statements.

Liquidity risk
The Group measures and monitors its liquidity structure based on the overall assets, liabilities and debt in conjunction with its expected cash fl ows to ensure the capability to meet any unexpected and material cash requirements in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the Group's senior bank facility's governing documents contain capital spending limits and other affi rmative and negative covenants which require the maintenance of secure capital procedures.
As at 31 December 2011, the Group held available-for-sale fi nancial investments and an interest rate swap at fair values with assets and liabilities measured at fair value for level 2 of HK$508.8 million and HK$20.8 million, respectively (2010: nil and HK$101.1 million, respectively), and the Group has not held any assets or liabilities measured at fair value for levels 1 and 3 during the years 2011 and 2010. Level 1 fair values are those measured using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical fi nancial instruments, level 2 fair values measured using quoted prices in active markets for similar fi nancial instruments, or using valuation techniques in which all signifi cant inputs are directly or indirectly based on observable market data and level 3 fair values are those measured using valuation techniques in which any signifi cant input is not based on observable market data.

Capital management
The primary objective of the Group's capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating in order to support its business and maximize shareholder's value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it as economic conditions change (i.e. interest rates and equity markets). To maintain a strong capital structure and in response to changes in economic conditions, the Group may modify debt instruments to obtain more favorable interest rates, obtain additional debt fi nancing, and may adjust dividend payments to shareholders as conditions require.
The gearing ratio is a key indicator of the Group's capital structure. The gearing ratio is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt.

29. EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD
Determination of unsuitability and redemption of Aruze USA, Inc. and affi liates and related matters
On 18 February 2012, WRL's Gaming Compliance Committee concluded a year-long investigation after receiving an independent report by Freeh, Sporkin & Sullivan, LLP (the "Freeh Report") detailing numerous prima facie violations of the United States Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") by Aruze USA, Inc., at the time a stockholder of WRL, Universal Entertainment Corporation, Aruze USA, Inc.'s parent company, and Kazuo Okada, the majority shareholder of Universal Entertainment Corporation, who is also a member of WRL's board of directors and was at the time a Director of the Company.

For the year ended 31 December 2011
29. EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD (continued)
Based on the Freeh Report, the board of directors of WRL determined that Aruze USA, Inc., Universal Entertainment Corporation and Mr. Okada are "unsuitable" under Article VII of the WRL articles of incorporation. The board of directors of WRL was unanimous (other than Mr. Okada) in its determination. The board of directors of WRL also requested that Mr. Okada resign as a director of WRL and recommended that Mr. Okada be removed as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company. On 18 February 2012, Mr. Okada was removed from the board of directors of Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of WRL.
Based on the board of directors of WRL's fi nding of "unsuitability", on 18 February 2012, WRL redeemed Aruze USA, Inc.'s 24,549,222 shares of WRL's common stock. Following a fi nding of "unsuitability", WRL's articles authorize redemption at "fair value" of the shares held by unsuitable persons. WRL engaged an independent fi nancial advisor to assist in the fair value calculation and concluded that a discount to the then-current trading price was appropriate because of, among other things, restrictions on most of the shares held by Arzue USA, Inc. under the terms of an existing stockholders agreement. Pursuant to the articles of incorporation of WRL, on 18 February 2012, WRL issued a subordinated promissory note in redemption of all of the shares of WRL common stock held by Aruze USA, Inc. (the "Redemption Price Promissory Note"). The Redemption Price Promissory Note has a principal amount of approximately US$1.9 billion (approximately HK$14.7 billion), matures on 18 February 2022 and bears interest at the rate of 2% per annum, payable annually in arrears on each anniversary of the date of the Redemption Price Promissory Note. WRL may, in its sole and absolute discretion, at any time and from time to time, and without penalty or premium, prepay the whole or any portion of the principal or interest due under the Redemption Price Promissory Note. In no instance shall any payment obligation under the Redemption Price Promissory Note be accelerated except in the sole and absolute discretion of WRL or as specifi cally mandated by law. The indebtedness evidenced by the Redemption Price Promissory Note is and shall be subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Redemption Price Promissory Note, to the prior payment in full of all existing and future obligations of WRL or any of its affi liates in respect of indebtedness for borrowed money of any kind or nature.
On 19 February 2012, WRL fi led a complaint in the District Court of Clark County, Nevada against Mr. Okada, Aruze USA, Inc. and Universal Entertainment Corporation alleging breaches of fi duciary duty and related claims. On 12 March 2012, Aruze USA, Inc. and Universal Entertainment Corporation removed the action to the United States District Court for the District of Nevada. On that same date, Aruze USA, Inc. and Universal Entertainment Corporation fi led an answer denying the claims and a
counterclaim that purports to assert claims against WRL, each of the members of WRL's board (other than Mr. Okada) and a senior executive of WRL. Among other relief, the counterclaim seeks a declaration that the redemption of Aruze USA, Inc.'s shares was void, an injunction restoring Aruze USA, Inc.'s share ownership and damages in an unspecifi ed amount.

29. EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD (continued)
On 24 February 2012, the Board of Directors of the Company removed Mr. Kazuo Okada from the Board.
On 7 March 2012, WRL fi led with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement for a special meeting of stockholders of WRL to be held for the purpose of voting on a proposal to remove Mr. Okada as a director of WRL.
WRL has provided the Freeh Report to applicable regulators and intends to cooperate with any related investigation that such regulators may undertake. The conduct of Mr. Okada and his affi liates and any resulting regulatory investigations could have adverse consequences to WRL and its subsidiaries. A fi nding by regulatory authorities that Mr. Okada violated the FCPA on property of WRL or its subsidiaries and/or otherwise involved WRL or its subsidiaries in criminal or civil violations could result in actions by regulatory authorities against WRL or its subsidiaries. Relatedly, regulators could pursue separate investigations into WRL's and its subsidiaries' compliance with applicable laws, including in response to litigation fi led by Mr. Okada suggesting improprieties in connection with Wynn Macau's donation to the University of Macau and a related informal inquiry by the SEC into this donation. While WRL believes that it is in full compliance with all applicable laws, any such investigations could result in actions by regulators against WRL or its subsidiaries.
Litigation commenced by Mr. Okada and related matters
As previously disclosed in May 2011, the Company made a commitment to the University of Macau Development Foundation in support of the new Asia-Pacifi c Academy of Economics and Management. This contribution consists of a MOP200.0 million (equivalent to HK$194.2 million) payment made in May 2011 and a commitment for additional donations of MOP80.0 million (equivalent to HK$77.7 million) each year for the calendar years 2012 through 2022 inclusive. The pledge was consistent with WRL's long-standing practice of providing philanthropic support for deserving institutions in the markets in which it operates. The pledge was made following an extensive analysis which concluded that the gift was made in accordance with all applicable laws. The pledge was considered by the boards of directors of both WRL and the Company and approved by 15 of the 16 directors who serve on those boards. The sole dissenting vote was cast by Mr. Kazuo Okada whose stated objection was to the length of time over which the donation would occur, not its propriety.
Mr. Okada commenced litigation on 11 January 2012, in Nevada state court seeking to compel WRL to produce information relating to the donation to the University of Macau, among other things.

On 8 February 2012, following Mr. Okada's lawsuit, WRL received a letter from the Salt Lake Regional Offi ce of the SEC requesting that, in connection with an informal inquiry by the SEC, WRL preserve information relating to, but not limited to, the donation to the University of Macau, any donations by WRL to any other educational charitable institutions, including the University of Macau Development Foundation, and WRL's casino or concession gaming licenses or renewals in Macau. WRL has informed the Salt Lake Regional Offi ce that it intends to fully comply with the SEC's request.
At a hearing on 9 February 2012, the Nevada state court stated that, as a director of WRL, Mr. Okada had the right to make a reasonable inspection of WRL's corporate books and records. Following the hearing, WRL released certain WRL documents to Mr. Okada for his inspection. At a subsequent hearing on 8 March 2012, the court considered Mr. Okada's request that WRL's board make additional documents available to him, and ruled that Mr. Okada was entitled to inspect two additional pages of WRL documents. WRL promptly complied with the court's ruling.
