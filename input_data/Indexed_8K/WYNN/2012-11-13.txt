On November 9, 2012, two of Wynn Resorts, Limited's wholly owned subsidiaries, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp. (together, the "issuers"), completed their offer to exchange up to $900,000,000 of their outstanding 5.375% First Mortgage Notes due 2022, which were issued on March 12, 2012 (the "old notes"), for 5.375% First Mortgage Notes due 2022 that have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "new notes"). The exchange offer was made in order to satisfy certain obligations of the issuers contained in a Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of March 12, 2012.
The exchange offer expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 6, 2012. Approximately $897.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the old notes were exchanged. This amount represents approximately 99.7% of the outstanding old notes. The new notes are substantially identical to the old notes exchanged, except that the new notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and, as a result, the transfer restrictions and registration rights provisions applicable to the old notes do not apply to the new notes.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
