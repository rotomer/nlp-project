Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On November 2, 2012, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Wynn Resorts, Limited (the "Company") adopted the Fifth Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the "Fifth Amended and Restated Bylaws"). The Fifth Amended and Restated Bylaws became effective immediately upon their adoption by the Board. The amendments are summarized below.
Advance Notice Provisions
The amendments provide that a stockholder must give any notice of intention to nominate directors or propose other business at an annual or special meeting not later than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, or, if the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 70 days after such anniversary date, notice must be delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting date and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting date or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. Previously, stockholders were required to deliver such notices not less than 60 nor more than 90 days prior to the day of the meeting, or, if the date of the meeting was first publicly announced or disclosed less than 70 days prior to the day of the meeting, not more than 10 days after such date was first announced or disclosed. Since the Company expects to hold its 2013 annual meeting of stockholders during the first week of May 2013, to be timely, a stockholder's notice for the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders must be delivered to the Company's principal executive offices not earlier than 5:00 p.m. (the close of business) on January 7, 2013 and not later than 5:00 p.m. (the close of business) on February 6, 2013.
The amendments require additional information from a stockholder who wishes to nominate a director or propose other business at a stockholder meeting. Among other things, a stockholder must provide information about agreements, arrangements and understandings relating to a director nomination or other business and any agreement, arrangement or understanding that has the effect or intent of mitigating loss, managing risk or benefiting from changes in the share price of any class or series of Company shares, or increasing or decreasing voting power with respect to Company shares, including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, hedging transactions and borrowed or loaned shares. In addition within five business days after the record date of the meeting, the stockholder must provide the Company with a written update of certain information required to be included in the stockholder's proposal or nomination notice to the Company. With respect to the proposal of business other than director nominations, the amendments also require additional information regarding the business the stockholder intends to propose. In addition, the amendments require any stockholder who wishes to nominate a director or propose other business at a stockholder meeting to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such nomination or other business.
Notice by Electronic Transmission
Amendments were made to provide that, pursuant to Nevada corporation law, certain forms of electronic transmission may be used for communications and notices by or to the Company, directors and stockholders.
 
Conduct of Meetings
Amendments were made to the provisions relating to the conduct of stockholder meetings, including more detailed provisions regarding who presides at such meetings and the responsibilities of such presiding person.
Other Amendments
The provision addressing exceptions to the Nevada acquisition of controlling interest statutes was amended to delete a reference to Aruze USA and its affiliates. In addition, amendments were made to improve readability, enhance consistency in the use of defined terms and cross-references, clarify the operation of various provisions and make other minor and conforming changes.
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Fifth Amended and Restated Bylaws, effective as of November 2, 2012, which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.

(b) If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders: (i) entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; and (ii) for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

Section 2.6 .
Quorum; Adjourned Meetings
(a) Unless the Articles of Incorporation provide for a different proportion, stockholders holding at least a majority of the voting power of the Corporation's capital stock, represented in person or by proxy (regardless of whether the proxy has authority to vote on all matters), are necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting. If, on any issue, voting by classes or series is required by the laws of the State of Nevada, the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, at least a majority of the voting power, represented in person or by proxy (regardless of whether the proxy has authority to vote on all matters), within each such class or series is necessary to constitute a quorum of each such class or series.
(b) If a quorum is not represented, a majority of the voting power represented or the person presiding at the meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall be represented. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be represented, any business may be transacted which might otherwise have been transacted at the adjourned meeting as originally called. When a stockholders' meeting is adjourned to another time or place hereunder, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. However, if a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting must be given to each stockholder of record as of the new record date. The stockholders present at a duly convened meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the departure of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum of the voting power.
Section 2.7 .
Voting
(a) Unless otherwise provided in the NRS, the Articles of Incorporation, or any resolution providing for the issuance of preferred stock adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to authority expressly vested in it by the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation, each stockholder of record, or such stockholder's duly authorized proxy, shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each share of voting stock standing registered in such stockholder's name at the close of business on the record date.
 
(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, all votes with respect to shares standing in the name of an individual at the close of business on the record date (including pledged shares) shall be cast only by that individual or such individual's duly authorized proxy. With respect to shares held by a representative of the estate of a deceased stockholder, or a guardian, conservator, custodian or trustee, even though the shares do not stand in the name of such holder, votes may be cast by such holder upon proof of such representative capacity. In the case of shares under the control of a receiver , the receiver may vote such shares even though the shares do not stand of record in the name of the receiver but only if and to the extent that the order of a court of competent jurisdiction which appoints the receiver contains the authority to vote such shares. If shares stand of record in the name of a minor, votes may be cast by the duly appointed guardian of the estate of such minor only if such guardian has provided the Corporation with written proof of such appointment.
(c) With respect to shares standing of record in the name of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other legal entity on the record date, votes may be cast: (i) in the case of a corporation, by such individual as the bylaws of such other corporation prescribe, by such individual as may be appointed by resolution of the board of directors of such other corporation or by such individual (including, without limitation, the officer making the authorization) authorized in writing to do so by the chairman of the board, if any, the chief executive officer, if any, the president or any vice president of such corporation; and (ii) in the case of a partnership, limited liability company or other legal entity, by an individual representing such stockholder upon presentation to the Corporation of satisfactory evidence of his or her authority to do so.
(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein and except for the Corporation's shares held in a fiduciary capacity, the Corporation shall not vote, directly or indirectly, shares of its own stock owned or held by it, and such shares shall not be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares entitled to vote.
(e) Any holder of shares entitled to vote on any matter may cast a portion of the votes in favor of such matter and refrain from casting the remaining votes or cast the same against the proposal, except in the case of elections of directors. If such holder entitled to vote does vote any of such stockholder's shares affirmatively and fails to specify the number of affirmative votes, it will be conclusively presumed that the holder is casting affirmative votes with respect to all shares held.
(f) With respect to shares standing of record in the name of two or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, husband and wife as community property, tenants by the entirety, voting trustees or otherwise and shares held by two or more persons (including proxy holders) having the same fiduciary relationship in respect to the same shares, votes may be cast in the following manner:
(i) If only one person votes, the vote of such person binds all.
(ii) If more than one person casts votes, the act of the majority so voting binds all.
(iii) If more than one person casts votes, but the vote is evenly split on a particular matter, the votes shall be deemed cast proportionately, as split.
(g) If a quorum is present, unless the Articles of Incorporation, these Bylaws, the NRS, or other applicable law provide for a different proportion, action by the stockholders entitled to vote on a matter, other than the election of directors, is approved by and is the act of the stockholders if the number of votes cast in favor of the action exceeds the number of votes cast in opposition to the action,
 
unless voting by classes or series is required for any action of the stockholders by the laws of the State of Nevada, the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, in which case the number of votes cast in favor of the action by the voting power of each such class or series must exceed the number of votes cast in opposition to the action by the voting power of each such class or series.
(h) If a quorum is present, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast.
Section 2.8 . At any meeting of stockholders, any holder of shares entitled to vote may designate, in a manner permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada, another person or persons to act as a proxy or proxies. If a stockholder designates two or more persons to act as proxies, then a majority of those persons present at a meeting has and may exercise all of the powers conferred by the stockholder or, if only one is present, then that one has and may exercise all of the powers conferred by the stockholder, unless the stockholder's designation of proxy provides otherwise. Every proxy shall continue in full force and effect until its expiration or revocation in a manner permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada.
Proxies
Section 2.9 . No action shall be taken by the stockholders except at an annual or special meeting of stockholders called and noticed in the manner required by these Bylaws. The stockholders may not in any circumstance take action by written consent.
No Action Without A Meeting

If the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present a nomination or proposed business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 2.10, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder (or a reliable reproduction or electronic transmission of the writing) delivered to the Corporation prior to the making of such nomination or proposal at such meeting by such stockholder stating that such person is authorized to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders.
Section 2.11 . Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called, noticed or convened and except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters not included in the notice, to the extent such notice is required, if such objection is expressly made at the time any such matters are presented at the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice or consent, except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws.

The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of or its equivalent, does not, of itself, create a presumption that the Indemnitee is liable pursuant to NRS 78.138 or did not act in good faith and in a manner in which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or that, with respect to any criminal proceeding he or she had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.

To the extent that an Indemnitee is successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Proceeding, or in the defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, the Corporation shall indemnify him or her against expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred in by him or her in connection with the defense.

Other Financial Arrangements
 
(f) .

Notwithstanding any other provision of these Bylaws (including, without limitation, Article X), no repeal or amendment of these Bylaws shall affect any or all of this Article VIII so as to limit or reduce the indemnification in any manner unless adopted by (i) the unanimous vote of the directors of the Corporation then serving, or (ii) by the stockholders as set forth in Article X; provided that no such amendment shall have a retroactive effect inconsistent with the preceding sentence.
