Exhibit 99.1 UNITED STATES STEEL CORPORATION REPORTS 2005 THIRD QUARTER RESULTS PITTSBURGH, Oct. 25 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- United States Steel Corporation Earnings Highlights (Dollars in millions except per share data) 3Q 2005 2Q 2005 3Q 2004 - ------------------------------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- Net sales $ 3,200 $ 3,582 $ 3,707 Segment income from operations Flat-rolled Products $ 41 $ 190 $ 362 U. S. Steel Europe 32 141 146 Tubular Products 124 133 55 Other Businesses 21 23 7 Total segment income from operations $ 218 $ 487 $ 570 Retiree benefit expenses (55) (70) (72) Other items not allocated to segments (4) (4) (4) Income from operations $ 159 $ 413 $ 494 Interest and other financial costs 17 20 8 Foreign currency losses (gains) (1) 43 (4) Net interest and other financial costs 16 63 4 Income tax provision 28 93 126 Net income $ 107 $ 245 $ 354 - Per basic share $ 0.89 $ 2.11 $ 3.08 - Per diluted share $ 0.82 $ 1.88 $ 2.72 United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) reported third quarter 2005 net income of $107 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2005 net income of $245 million, or $1.88 per diluted share, and third quarter 2004 net income of $354 million, or $2.72 per diluted share. Commenting on third quarter results, U. S. Steel President and CEO John P. Surma said, "Our Flat-rolled and European segments remained profitable despite lower spot market prices and reduced operating rates. Our largest domestic blast furnace and our largest European blast furnace were both down for the entire quarter for major rebuilds. In addition, after standing idle for eighteen years, our No. 1 blast furnace in Serbia took time to ramp up to full production following a rebuild completed in June. In contrast, our Tubular segment had another outstanding quarter as demand and prices remained strong." The company reported third quarter 2005 income from operations of $159 million, compared with income from operations of $413 million in the second quarter of 2005 and $494 million in the third quarter of 2004. Other items not allocated to segments reduced third quarter 2005 net income by $4 million, or 3 cents per diluted share and second quarter 2005 net income by $3 million, or 2 cents per diluted share. Third quarter 2004 net income was increased by $21 million, or 16 cents per diluted share, primarily resulting from a $24 million favorable effect related to the settlements of prior years' income tax audits. Foreign currency gains in the third quarter of 2005 were $1 million, compared to losses of $43 million in the second quarter of 2005 and gains of $4 million in the third quarter of 2004. The year-to-date losses in 2005 primarily reflect accounting remeasurement losses from the appreciation of the U.S. dollar functional currency versus the euro and other local currencies. Reportable Segments and Other Businesses Management uses segment income from operations to evaluate company performance because we believe it to be a key measure of ongoing operating results. U. S. Steel's reportable segments and Other Businesses reported segment income from operations of $218 million, or $47 per ton, in the third quarter of 2005, compared with $487 million, or $100 per ton, in the second quarter of 2005 and $570 million, or $108 per ton, in the third quarter of 2004.
The decrease in third quarter 2005 Flat-rolled income from operations compared to the second quarter primarily reflected lower spot prices and higher natural gas costs. The decline in European results was mainly due to lower spot market prices and shipments compared to the second quarter, partly resulting from a longer than anticipated outage at the No. 2 blast furnace in Slovakia. Outlook Commenting on U. S. Steel's outlook, Surma said, "With continuing reductions in service center inventory levels and firming spot prices, we expect fourth quarter market conditions to show improvement over the third, but results will remain well below those of the first two quarters of the year. Our order book remains strong across all industries, but we will continue to be affected by high natural gas prices and by reduced domestic raw steel capability for the duration of the Gary blast furnace rebuild." For Flat-rolled, fourth quarter 2005 shipments and average realized prices are expected to improve compared to the third quarter; however, these effects may be more than offset by higher costs for natural gas. We expect the Gary No. 14 blast furnace to start up in December and to reach full production early next year. For U. S. Steel Europe (USSE), fourth quarter shipments are expected to improve compared to the third quarter with all five blast furnaces operational after the October 12 restart of No. 2 blast furnace in Slovakia. Average realized prices should also improve, reflecting the recent increase in spot prices. Raw material costs are expected to decline compared to the third quarter. Shipments for the Tubular segment in the fourth quarter of 2005 are expected to return to second quarter levels while average realized prices should increase due to continued strong energy markets. The transfer price of tube rounds supplied by Flat-rolled was increased by $46 per ton effective October 1, 2005. Common Stock Repurchase Program On July 26, 2005, U. S. Steel announced that its Board of Directors had approved the repurchase of up to eight million shares of its common stock. During the third quarter, 1,210,000 shares were repurchased under this program for a total cost of $52 million. ***** This release contains forward-looking statements with respect to market conditions, operating costs, shipments and prices. Some factors, among others, that could affect market conditions, costs, shipments and prices for both domestic operations and USSE include global product demand, prices and mix; global and company steel production levels; plant operating performance; the timing and completion of the startup of the No. 14 blast furnace project at Gary Works and other facility projects; natural gas and electricity prices and usage; scrap and other raw materials availability and prices; the impact of fixed prices in energy and raw materials contracts (many of which have terms of one year or longer) as compared to short-term contract and spot prices of steel products; changes in environmental, tax and other laws; employee strikes; power outages; and U.S. and global economic performance and political developments. Domestic steel shipments and prices could be affected by import levels and actions taken by the U.S. Government and its agencies. Economic conditions and political factors in Europe that may affect USSE's results include, but are not limited to, taxation, nationalization, inflation, currency fluctuations, increased regulation, export quotas, tariffs, and other protectionist measures. In accordance with "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, cautionary statements identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward- looking statements have been included in the Form 10-K of U. S. Steel for the year ended December 31, 2004, and in subsequent filings for U. S. Steel. A Statement of Operations (Unaudited), Other Financial Data (Unaudited) and Preliminary Supplemental Statistics (Unaudited) for U. S. Steel are attached. The company will conduct a conference call on third quarter earnings on Tuesday, October 25, at 2 p.m. EDT. To listen to the webcast of the conference call, visit the U. S.
