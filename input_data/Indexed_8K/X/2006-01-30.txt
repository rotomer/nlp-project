Exhibit 99.1 United States Steel Corporation Public Affairs 600 Grant Street Pittsburgh, PA 15219-2800 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- News - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [LOGO OF USS] Contacts: Media ----- John Armstrong (412) 433-6792 Investors/Analysts ------------------ Nick Harper (412) 433-1184 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - --------------------- UNITED STATES STEEL CORPORATION REPORTS 2005 FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR RESULTS - ---------- * See Footnote (a) to Statement of Operations PITTSBURGH, January 30, 2005 - United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) reported fourth quarter 2005 net income of $109 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2005 adjusted net income of $93 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, and fourth quarter 2004 adjusted net income of $451 million, or $3.46 per diluted share.
2 For full-year 2005, U. S. Steel reported net income of $910 million or $7.00 per diluted share, compared to 2004 adjusted net income of $1,135 million, or $8.83 per diluted share. Prior period results have been adjusted retrospectively for a change in the method of accounting for inventories at U. S. Steel Kosice (USSK) as discussed later. Commenting on results, U. S. Steel President and CEO John P. Surma said, "A strong fourth quarter operating performance contributed to making 2005 a very good year. Our annual earnings were the second highest on record and we had another year of solid return on capital employed. Importantly, our safety performance improved substantially, thanks to the outstanding efforts of our employees. Capital spending and repair and maintenance expenses were higher than anticipated primarily because we expanded the scope of work and experienced several delays related to the Gary No. 14 blast furnace project. We are proceeding through the start-up process and expect to be producing at full capacity of 9,200 tons of hot metal per day in a relatively short time." The company reported fourth quarter 2005 income from operations of $222 million, compared with adjusted income from operations of $148 million in the third quarter of 2005 and $543 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. For the year 2005, income from operations was $1,439 million versus adjusted income from operations of $1,625 million for the year 2004. Results in fourth quarter 2005 included an income tax charge of $16 million resulting from the repatriation of $300 million of foreign earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, a pre-tax charge of $20 million for environmental remediation related to a former steel production site that was sold years ago, and a pre-tax charge of $11 million for special termination benefits under the voluntary early retirement program at USSK. These items and another small item not allocated to segments reduced fourth quarter 2005 net income by $39 million, or 30 cents per diluted share. Other items not allocated to segments reduced third quarter 2005 net income by $4 million, or 3 cents per diluted share. Net income in fourth quarter 2004 included tax benefits totaling $30 million related to prior year research and development credits and USSK debt repayment. These benefits and other items not allocated to segments increased fourth quarter 2004 net income by $14 million, or 11 cents per diluted share.
3 Foreign currency gains in the fourth quarter of 2005 were $1 million, compared to losses of $3 million in the third quarter of 2005 and gains of $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. The losses for the full-year 2005 primarily reflect accounting remeasurement losses from the appreciation of the U.S. dollar functional currency versus the euro and other local currencies. Effective January 1, 2006, the functional currency for our European operations was changed to the euro, which should reduce future period remeasurement gains and losses. REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND OTHER BUSINESSES Management believes segment income from operations is a key measure to evaluate ongoing operating results and performance. U. S. Steel's reportable segments and Other Businesses reported segment income from operations of $313 million, or $63 per ton, in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with $207 million, or $44 per ton, in the third quarter of 2005 and $644 million, or $120 per ton, in the fourth quarter of 2004. Segment income from operations for full-year 2005 was $1,675 million, or $85 per ton, compared with $1,879 million, or $86 per ton for 2004. The increase in fourth quarter 2005 European income from operations compared to the third quarter primarily reflected lower raw material and outage costs and operating efficiencies due to higher operating levels. The improvement in fourth quarter versus third quarter Tubular results was largely due to higher prices and shipment volumes. Flat-rolled's fourth quarter results were in line with the third quarter as higher prices and shipment volumes were offset by increased costs for natural gas and electricity and higher project costs related to the Gary No. 14 blast furnace.
4 OUTLOOK Commenting on U. S. Steel's outlook, Surma said, "The first quarter of 2006 looks good for our domestic and European markets. Service center and end customer inventories are balanced and we expect continued strength in the energy markets served by our Tubular segment." For Flat-rolled, first quarter 2006 shipments are expected to improve compared to the fourth quarter of 2005 due to the restart of the Gary No. 14 blast furnace, and prices should remain at about the fourth quarter level. We expect higher raw material costs to be partially offset by reduced outage costs. For U. S. Steel Europe (USSE), first quarter shipments are expected to increase and average realized prices and costs should be consistent with fourth quarter levels; however, the effect of natural gas supply disruptions that have recently curtailed Serbian operations is uncertain. Shipments and average realized prices for the Tubular segment in the first quarter of 2006 are expected to be in line with the fourth quarter. First quarter 2006 results for Other Businesses should decline from the fourth quarter due primarily to normal seasonal variations at our iron ore operations in Minnesota. Capital expenditures for 2006 are expected to total approximately $700 million, reflecting domestic spending of approximately $440 million and European spending of approximately $260 million.
5 PENSIONS AND BENEFITS During 2005, U. S. Steel made a first quarter voluntary cash contribution of $130 million to its main defined benefit pension plan and a fourth quarter voluntary cash contribution of $50 million to a qualified trust for payment of future retiree medical expenses. At year-end 2005, U. S. Steel's main defined benefit pension plan was measured and it was again determined that an additional minimum liability is required for this plan. The reestablishment of this liability net of associated tax effects resulted in a net charge to equity of approximately $1.4 billion and had no effect on income or cash flow. Total costs for pension plans and other postretirement benefits are expected to be approximately $300 million in 2006, compared to $390 million in 2005. COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM On July 26, 2005, U. S. Steel announced that its Board of Directors had approved the repurchase of up to eight million shares of its common stock. During 2005, 5.8 million shares were repurchased under this program for a total cost of $254 million, including 4.6 million shares repurchased in the fourth quarter for a total cost of $202 million. CHANGE TO FIFO METHOD FOR USSK During the fourth quarter of 2005, U. S. Steel changed its method of determining the cost of USSK inventories from the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method to the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Management considers the FIFO method to be preferable to the LIFO method for USSK because it creates consistency of the valuation method used for inventories within the USSE reportable segment and provides for comparability of the USSE segment with major international competitors. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 154, prior period results have been adjusted to apply the new method retrospectively. This change had an unfavorable effect on fourth quarter and full-year 2005 USSE segment operating results of $22 million and $17 million, respectively. After including effects of foreign currency remeasurement and tax provisions, the unfavorable net income effect of this change on U. S. Steel's fourth quarter and full-year 2005 results was $35 million and $41 million, respectively. See Appendix A. *****
6 This release contains forward-looking statements with respect to market conditions, operating costs, shipments, prices, capital spending and employee benefit costs. Some factors, among others, that could affect market conditions, costs, shipments and prices for both domestic operations and USSE include global product demand, prices and mix; global and company steel production levels; plant operating performance, including the start up of the recently completed blast furnace projects; the timing and completion of facility projects; natural gas prices, usage and supply disruptions such as are occurring in Serbia; raw materials availability and prices; changes in environmental, tax and other laws; employee strikes; power outages; and U.S. and global economic performance and political developments. Domestic steel shipments and prices could be affected by import levels and actions taken by the U.S. Government. Economic conditions and political factors in Europe that may affect USSE's results include, but are not limited to, taxation, nationalization, inflation, currency fluctuations, increased regulation, export quotas, tariffs, and other protectionist measures. Factors that may affect the amount of net periodic benefit costs include, among others, changes to laws affecting benefits, pension fund investment performance, liability changes and interest rates. In accordance with "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, cautionary statements identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements have been included in the Form 10-K of U. S. Steel for the year ended December 31, 2004, and in subsequent filings for U. S. Steel. *****
