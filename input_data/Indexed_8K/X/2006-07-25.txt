Exhibit 99.1 UNITED STATES STEEL CORPORATION REPORTS 2006 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS PITTSBURGH, July 25 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- EARNINGS HIGHLIGHTS United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) reported second quarter 2006 net income of $404 million, or $3.22 per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2006 net income of $256 million, or $2.04 per diluted share, and second quarter 2005 net income of $249 million, or $1.91 per diluted share. Commenting on results, U. S. Steel Chairman and CEO John P. Surma said, "Solid demand in our key end markets, outstanding operating performance, strong shipments and firming prices, particularly in spot markets, resulted in an excellent second quarter with earnings significantly higher than both the previous quarter and the same quarter last year. We operated at high rates of production capability in the U.S. and Europe, reflecting an outstanding performance by our people and the benefits of our recent capital programs." The company reported second quarter 2006 income from operations of $514 million, compared with income from operations of $369 million in the first quarter of 2006 and $421 million in the second quarter of 2005. The income tax provision in the second quarter of 2006 included a favorable adjustment of $15 million, or 12 cents per diluted share, related to the 2005 estimated tax accrual. During the second quarter of 2006, our 7.00% Series B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Shares automatically converted into common stock, increasing our common stock outstanding by approximately 16 million shares. We repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for $117 million during the second quarter, bringing the total shares repurchased to 7.7 million for $371 million since our repurchase program was authorized in July 2005. Reportable Segments and Other Businesses Management believes segment income from operations is a key measure in evaluating company performance. U. S. Steel's reportable segments and Other Businesses reported segment income from operations of $579 million, or $99 per ton, in the second quarter of 2006, compared with $429 million, or $80 per ton, in the first quarter of 2006 and $495 million, or $102 per ton, in the second quarter of 2005. The increase in second quarter 2006 Flat-rolled income from operations compared to the first quarter mainly resulted from higher average realized prices and shipment volumes. Costs remained in line with first quarter levels as lower energy and outage costs were offset by higher raw material and profit-based costs. The improvement in European operating results was due primarily to higher prices and record shipments. Tubular operating results remained strong, but declined as expected from the first quarter due to scheduled maintenance outages, which were completed as planned.
Outlook Commenting on U. S. Steel's outlook, Surma said, "We expect continued strong operating results for our three reportable segments in the third quarter of 2006. Healthy steel consumption levels are expected during the quarter along with further increases in flat-rolled prices in the U.S. and in Europe." For Flat-rolled, we expect increased third quarter 2006 average realized prices, partially offset by increased costs for raw materials and outages, and shipments are expected to be comparable to second quarter levels. Third quarter average realized prices are also expected to improve for U. S. Steel Europe (USSE), partially offset by higher costs, primarily for raw materials. Shipments are expected to remain at second quarter levels. In Serbia, we are currently involved in discussions with our employees, unions and government agencies regarding a workforce reduction plan that may be initiated as early as the third quarter. Shipments and average realized prices for the Tubular segment in the third quarter of 2006 are expected to be in line with second quarter levels, and costs are expected to improve due mainly to lower outage costs. This release contains forward-looking statements with respect to market conditions, operating costs, shipments and prices. Some factors, among others, that could affect market conditions, costs, shipments and prices for both domestic operations and USSE include global product demand, prices and mix; global and company steel production levels; plant operating performance; the timing and completion of facility projects; natural gas and electricity prices and usage; raw materials availability and prices; the impact of fixed prices in energy and raw materials contracts (many of which have terms of one year or longer) as compared to shorter-term contracts and spot prices of steel products; changes in environmental, tax and other laws; employee strikes; power outages or curtailments; and U.S. and global economic performance and political developments. Domestic steel shipments and prices could be affected by import levels and actions taken by the U.S. Government and its agencies. Economic conditions and political factors in Europe that may affect USSE's results include, but are not limited to, taxation, nationalization, inflation, currency fluctuations, increased regulation, export quotas, tariffs, and other protectionist measures. In accordance with "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, cautionary statements identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements have been included in the Form 10-K of U. S. Steel for the year ended December 31, 2005, and in subsequent filings for U. S. Steel. A Statement of Operations (Unaudited), Other Financial Data (Unaudited) and Preliminary Supplemental Statistics (Unaudited) for U. S. Steel are attached. The company will conduct a conference call on second quarter earnings on Tuesday, July 25, at 2 p.m. EDT. To listen to the webcast of the conference call, visit the U. S.
