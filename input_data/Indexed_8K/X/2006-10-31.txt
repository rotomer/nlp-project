Commenting on results, U. S. Steel Chairman and CEO John P. Surma said, "Earnings for each of our business segments improved from the second quarter, reflecting a very strong operating performance and favorable steel market conditions." The company reported third quarter 2006 income from operations of $561 million, compared with income from operations of $514 million in the second quarter of 2006 and $148 million in the third quarter of 2005. Other items not allocated to segments in the third quarter of 2006 reduced net income by $21 million, or 17 cents per diluted share, and consisted of employee severance and benefit charges for a workforce reduction of over 20 percent at our Serbian operations. In the second quarter of 2006, the income tax provision included a favorable adjustment of $15 million, or 12 cents per diluted share, related to the 2005 tax accrual. We repurchased 4.7 million shares of U. S. Steel common stock for $279 million during the third quarter, bringing total repurchases to 12.4 million shares for $650 million since the repurchase program was originally authorized in July 2005. Reportable Segments and Other Businesses Management believes segment income from operations is a key measure in evaluating company performance. U. S. Steel's reportable segments and Other Businesses reported segment income from operations of $652 million, or $117 per ton, in the third quarter of 2006, compared with $579 million, or $99 per ton, in the second quarter of 2006 and $207 million, or $44 per ton, in the third quarter of 2005.
Segment income from operations for the third quarter of 2006 increased compared to the second quarter as average realized prices strengthened in all of our reportable segments. Higher average realized prices were partially offset by higher raw material costs and reduced shipment volumes. Outlook Commenting on U. S. Steel's outlook, Surma said, "We expect continued strong results from our European and Tubular segments in the fourth quarter; however, overall operating results are expected to decline from the third quarter, primarily reflecting reduced profitability in our Flat-rolled segment. Recent weakening in the U.S. economy coupled with high imports and customer inventory levels have resulted in softer flat-rolled spot markets in the near term." For Flat-rolled, we expect fourth quarter 2006 average realized prices and shipments to be lower than in the third quarter, and costs are expected to increase primarily due to several blast furnace outages and lower operating rates. We will adjust the duration of these outages so that our operations are in balance with our anticipated customer demand. Fourth quarter average realized prices are expected to remain around the third quarter level for U. S. Steel Europe (USSE), and higher costs are expected to more than offset the anticipated increase in shipment volumes. Average realized prices for the Tubular segment in the fourth quarter of 2006 are expected to decline slightly from third quarter levels, and shipments will be significantly lower due to high levels of imports and customer efforts to bring their inventories in line with demand. Our longer-term outlook will be determined by overall economic growth trends. This release contains forward-looking statements with respect to market conditions, operating costs, shipments and prices. Some factors, among others, that could affect market conditions, costs, shipments and prices for both domestic operations and USSE include global product demand, prices and mix; global and company steel production levels; plant operating performance; the timing and completion of facility projects; natural gas and electricity prices and usage; raw materials availability and prices; the impact of fixed prices in energy and raw materials contracts (many of which have terms of one year or longer) as compared to shorter-term contracts and spot prices of steel products; changes in environmental, tax and other laws; employee strikes; power outages or curtailments; and U.S. and global economic performance and political developments. Domestic steel shipments and prices could be affected by import levels and actions taken by the U.S. Government and its agencies. Economic conditions and political factors in Europe that may affect USSE's results include, but are not limited to, taxation, nationalization, inflation, currency fluctuations, increased regulation, export quotas, tariffs, and other protectionist measures. In accordance with "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, cautionary statements identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements have been included in the Form 10-K of U. S. Steel for the year ended December 31, 2005, and in subsequent filings for U. S. Steel. A Statement of Operations (Unaudited), Other Financial Data (Unaudited) and Preliminary Supplemental Statistics (Unaudited) for U. S. Steel are attached. The company will conduct a conference call on third quarter earnings on Tuesday, October 31, at 2 p.m. EST. To listen to the webcast of the conference call, visit the U. S.
