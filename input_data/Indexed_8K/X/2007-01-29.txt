Exhibit 99.1 United States Steel Corporation Public Affairs 600 Grant Street Pittsburgh, PA 15219-2800 412 433 6870 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Contacts: Media ----- John Armstrong (412) 433-6792 Investors/Analysts ------------------ Nick Harper (412) 433-1184 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - --------------------- UNITED STATES STEEL CORPORATION REPORTS 2006 FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR RESULTS EARNINGS HIGHLIGHTS - ---------- * Includes a $32 million pre-tax charge related to the early retirement of debt PITTSBURGH, January 29, 2007 - United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) reported fourth quarter 2006 net income of $297 million, or $2.50 per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2006 net income of $417 million, or $3.42 per diluted share, and fourth quarter 2005 net income of $109 million, or $0.85 per diluted share.
For full-year 2006, U. S. Steel reported net income of $1,374 million or $11.18 per diluted share, compared to 2005 net income of $910 million, or $7.00 per diluted share. Commenting on results, U. S. Steel Chairman and CEO John P. Surma said, "Our performance in 2006 resulted in another outstanding year, with record sales, operating income and net earnings. During the year, our strong cash flow generation enabled us to reduce our debt by almost $600 million, to repurchase common shares for $442 million, to make voluntary cash contributions of $190 million to our domestic benefit plans, to make significant capital investments and to double our common dividend rate to 20 cents per share. Our safety performance also improved substantially from last year thanks to the continuing efforts of our employees. All in all, 2006 will go down as one of the best years in our long history." The company reported fourth quarter 2006 income from operations of $341 million, compared with income from operations of $561 million in the third quarter of 2006 and $222 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. For the year 2006, income from operations was $1,785 million versus income from operations of $1,439 million for the year 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2006, net interest and other financial costs included a $32 million pre-tax charge related to the early redemption of most of our 10-3/4% Senior Notes. This item and other items not allocated to segments decreased net income by $33 million or 28 cents per diluted share. Other items not allocated to segments in the third quarter of 2006 reduced net income by $21 million, or 17 cents per diluted share. An income tax charge and other items not allocated to segments reduced fourth quarter 2005 net income by $39 million, or 30 cents per diluted share.
The annual effective tax rate for 2006 was lower than previously expected and we reduced our fourth quarter income tax provision by $58 million in order to adjust tax expense previously recorded. This adjustment primarily reflected a higher than anticipated percentage of total pre-tax earnings generated by our European operations and the impact of accounting rules on remeasuring the status of our main defined benefit pension plan at year end. REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND OTHER BUSINESSES Management believes segment income from operations is a key measure to evaluate ongoing operating results and performance. U. S. Steel's reportable segments and Other Businesses reported segment income from operations of $414 million, or $85 per ton, in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with $652 million, or $117 per ton, in the third quarter of 2006 and $313 million, or $63 per ton, in the fourth quarter of 2005. Our fourth quarter was significantly better than the fourth quarter last year, but weaker than the earlier 2006 quarters as inventory rebalancing and high import levels reduced domestic demand for steel. Segment income from operations for full-year 2006 was $2,074 million, or $96 per ton, compared with $1,675 million, or $85 per ton for 2005. Flat-rolled's fourth quarter results were significantly lower than the third quarter as shipment volumes and average realized prices decreased, and production costs increased as operating rates were curtailed to 67 percent of capability. The decrease in fourth quarter 2006 European income from operations compared to the third quarter was mainly due to higher costs, partially offset by higher average realized prices. Fourth quarter Tubular results decreased from the third quarter due mainly to lower shipments resulting from high levels of imports and customer inventories. Results for Other Businesses in the fourth quarter included approximately $25 million related to land sales by our real estate unit.
OUTLOOK Commenting on U. S. Steel's outlook, Surma said, "We expect first quarter results to decline from the fourth quarter, but flat-rolled demand is firming and we have restarted several domestic blast furnaces to bring our production in line with improving order rates." For Flat-rolled, first quarter 2007 shipments are expected to improve compared to the fourth quarter of 2006, and average realized prices should remain at about the fourth quarter level as contract price improvements offset lower spot prices. For U. S. Steel Europe (USSE), first quarter shipments are expected to increase from the fourth quarter, and average realized prices are expected to be slightly lower as the result of increased import product availability on the European market. Shipments and average realized prices for the Tubular segment in the first quarter of 2007 are expected to decrease from the fourth quarter as import levels and customer inventories remain high. First quarter costs for all of our reportable segments are expected to be in line with the fourth quarter. First quarter 2007 results for Other Businesses are expected to be consistent with historical first quarter results, but will decline substantially from the fourth quarter due primarily to normal seasonal effects at our iron ore operations in Minnesota and the non-recurrence of the fourth quarter land sales. Capital expenditures for 2007 are expected to total approximately $750 million, reflecting domestic spending of approximately $545 million and European spending of approximately $205 million. PENSIONS AND OTHER BENEFITS At year-end 2006, our defined benefit pension plans were overfunded by $210 million on a projected benefit obligation basis. The combined effects of reversing previously recorded additional minimum liabilities and the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158 for pensions and other benefits resulted in a net charge to equity of $186 million in the fourth quarter.
Total costs for pension plans and other postretirement benefits are expected to be approximately $237 million in 2007, compared to $312 million in 2006. COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM We repurchased over 700,000 shares of U. S. Steel common stock for $46 million during the fourth quarter, bringing total repurchases to 13.1 million shares for $696 million since the repurchase program was originally authorized in July 2005. As of December 31, 2006, 7.7 million shares remained authorized for repurchase under our stock repurchase program. ***** This release contains forward-looking statements with respect to market conditions, operating costs, shipments, prices, capital spending and employee benefit costs. Some factors, among others, that could affect market conditions, costs, shipments and prices for both domestic operations and USSE include global product demand, prices and mix; global and company steel production levels; plant operating performance, including the start up of several blast furnaces; the timing and completion of facility projects; natural gas prices, usage and supply disruptions; raw materials availability and prices; changes in environmental, tax and other laws; employee strikes; power outages; and U.S. and global economic performance and political developments. Domestic steel shipments and prices could be affected by import levels and actions taken by the U.S. Government. Economic conditions and political factors in Europe that may affect USSE's results include, but are not limited to, taxation, environmental permitting, nationalization, inflation, currency fluctuations, increased regulation, export quotas, tariffs, and other protectionist measures. Factors that may affect the amount of net periodic benefit costs include, among others, changes to laws affecting benefits, pension fund investment performance, liability changes and interest rates. In accordance with "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, cautionary statements identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements have been included in the Form 10-K of U.
