2 Commenting on results, U. S. Steel Chairman and CEO John P. Surma said, "We had another good quarter with record results for U. S. Steel Europe (USSE). During the quarter, we completed the $2 billion acquisition of Lone Star Technologies (Lone Star) and we're pleased with the progress we`ve made to date in integrating our new facilities and employees into U. S. Steel. Also during the quarter, we issued $1.1 billion of senior notes, expanded our credit facilities and retired $378 million of 9.75% senior notes that were due in 2010." The company reported second quarter 2007 income from operations of $391 million, compared with income from operations of $346 million in the first quarter of 2007 and $514 million in the second quarter of 2006. In the second quarter of 2007, net interest and other financial costs included a $23 million pre-tax charge related to the early redemption of our 9.75% Senior Notes due 2010. This charge reduced net income by $14 million or 12 cents per diluted share. In the first quarter of 2007, net interest and other financial costs included a $3 million pre-tax charge related to the early redemption of our 10% Senior Quarterly Income Debt Securities. This charge reduced net income by $2 million or 2 cents per diluted share. The income tax provision in the second quarter of 2006 included a favorable adjustment of $15 million, or 12 cents per diluted share, related to estimated 2005 tax accruals. We repurchased 304,900 shares of common stock for $33 million during the second quarter. Reportable Segments and Other Businesses Management believes segment income from operations is a key measure in evaluating company performance. U. S. Steel's reportable segments and Other Businesses reported segment income from operations of $434 million, or $79 per ton, in the second quarter of 2007, compared with $385 million, or $76 per ton, in the first quarter of 2007 and $579 million, or $99 per ton, in the second quarter of 2006.
3 The increase in second quarter 2007 Flat-rolled income from operations compared to the first quarter mainly resulted from higher shipments and an increased utilization rate, with partial offsets from higher outage and raw material costs. The improvement in European operating results was due primarily to higher prices. Tubular operating results remained strong, but declined as expected from the first quarter due mainly to lower prices. The operating results of Lone Star are included in Tubular effective June 14th, including increased depreciation and amortization as a result of purchase accounting asset valuations. Lone Star added 47,000 tons to second quarter Tubular shipments. Outlook Commenting on U. S. Steel's outlook, Surma said, "We expect continued strong performance by our three reportable segments in the third quarter of 2007, with overall operating results improving from the second quarter, excluding any charges resulting from Lone Star integration activities." For Flat-rolled, third quarter results are expected to improve from the second quarter due primarily to reduced outage and related costs and higher shipments, partially offset by slightly lower average realized prices, reflecting current spot market conditions and higher semi-finished product shipments. Third quarter results are expected to decrease for U. S. Steel Europe mainly as a result of higher costs resulting from outage spending and related effects, including a blast furnace reline in Serbia, which will begin in September. Shipments are expected to decrease while average realized prices should increase slightly from second quarter levels. Third quarter average realized prices for Tubular are expected to decrease from second quarter levels, including the effects of product mix. Results will reflect the inclusion of Lone Star for the entire quarter. Third quarter Tubular results may be negatively impacted as we address inventory issues in conjunction with the integration.
4 ***** This release contains forward-looking statements with respect to expected synergies from the Lone Star acquisition, market conditions, operating costs, shipments and prices. Factors that may affect expected synergies from the Lone Star acquisition include management's ability to successfully integrate Lone Star's operations; reactions of customers and joint venture and alliance partners; operating levels in the Tubular segment; and expansions or acquisitions by major tubular competitors. Some factors, among others, that could affect market conditions, costs, shipments and prices for both domestic operations and USSE include global product demand, prices and mix; global and company steel production levels; plant operating performance; the timing and completion of facility projects; natural gas and electricity prices and usage; raw materials and transportation availability and prices; the impact of fixed prices in energy and raw materials contracts (many of which have terms of one year or longer) as compared to shorter-term contracts and spot prices of steel products; changes in environmental, tax and other laws; employee strikes; power outages or curtailments; and U.S. and global economic performance and political developments. Domestic steel shipments and prices could be affected by import levels and actions taken by the U.S. Government and its agencies. Economic conditions and political factors in Europe that may affect USSE's results include, but are not limited to, taxation, nationalization, inflation, currency fluctuations, increased regulation, export quotas, tariffs, and other protectionist measures. In accordance with "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, cautionary statements identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements have been included in the Form 10-K of U. S. Steel for the year ended December 31, 2006, and in subsequent filings for U. S. Steel.
