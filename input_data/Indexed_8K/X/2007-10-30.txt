United States Steel Corporation Reports 2007 Third Quarter Results PITTSBURGH, Oct. 30 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Earnings Highlights 3Q 2007 2Q 2007 3Q 2006 (Dollars in millions except per share data) Net sales $4,354 $4,228 $4,106 Segment income from operations Flat-rolled $170 $92 $230 U. S. Steel Europe 152 244 219 Tubular 74 97 164 Other Businesses 37 1 39 Total segment income from operations $433 $434 $652 Retiree benefit expenses (46) (43) (70) Other items not allocated to segments (27) - (21) Income from operations $360 $391 $561 Net interest and other financial costs 22 34 7 Income tax provision 68 53 136 Net income $269 $302 $417 -- Per basic share $2.28 $2.55 $3.44 -- Per diluted share $2.27 $2.54 $3.42 United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) reported third quarter 2007 net income of $269 million, or $2.27 per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2007 net income of $302 million, or $2.54 per diluted share, and third quarter 2006 net income of $417 million, or $3.42 per diluted share. Commenting on results, U. S. Steel Chairman and CEO John P. Surma said, "We had a good quarter as each of our segments effectively responded to diverse challenges, including general economic concerns that affected our major markets. We made good progress in implementing a unified business model for our Tubular segment and are realizing synergies from the Lone Star acquisition." The company reported third quarter 2007 income from operations of $360 million, compared with income from operations of $391 million in the second quarter of 2007 and $561 million in the third quarter of 2006. Other items not allocated to segments in the third quarter of 2007 consisted of a $27 million pre-tax charge related to inventory acquired in the Lone Star acquisition. The tax provision included several discrete charges totaling $11 million. These charges and the item not allocated to segments reduced third quarter 2007 net income by $28 million, or 23 cents per diluted share. In the second quarter of 2007, net interest and other financial costs included a $23 million pre-tax charge related to the early redemption of our 9.75% Senior Notes due 2010. This charge reduced net income by $14 million or 12 cents per diluted share. Other items not allocated to segments in the third quarter of 2006 reduced net income by $21 million, or 17 cents per diluted share, and consisted of employee severance and benefit charges for a workforce reduction of over 20 percent at our Serbian operations. We repurchased 285,000 shares of common stock for $28 million during the third quarter.
Reportable Segments and Other Businesses Management believes segment income from operations is a key measure in evaluating company performance. U. S. Steel's reportable segments and Other Businesses reported segment income from operations of $433 million, or $78 per ton, in the third quarter of 2007, compared with $434 million, or $79 per ton, in the second quarter of 2007 and $652 million, or $117 per ton, in the third quarter of 2006. Flat-rolled income from operations improved for the third consecutive quarter, despite a $9 per ton decrease in average realized prices and higher raw material costs compared to the second quarter. The improved results primarily reflected higher operating rates including hot rolled band shipments to support Tubular, and lower outage and energy costs. The decrease in European operating results was due primarily to lower shipments related to outages, increased raw material costs and higher unit costs resulting from lower raw steel capability utilization. Tubular operating results declined due mainly to lower prices and the effects of integrating Lone Star into the U. S. Steel supply chain and establishing our unified business model. Distributor inventories and imports remained high. Results for Other Businesses improved from the second quarter largely as a result of lower outage costs at iron ore operations. Outlook Commenting on U. S. Steel's outlook, Surma said, "We expect a decline in overall results for the fourth quarter mainly due to normal seasonal effects and several scheduled blast furnace outages. North American flat-rolled inventories and imports are at relatively low levels and over time the weaker U.S. currency should favor many of our steel-consuming customers. In Europe, steel consumption remains healthy; however, high imports, particularly from China, and high service center inventories are resulting in some pressure on spot prices and order rates." For Flat-rolled, fourth quarter results are expected to decrease from the third quarter due primarily to lower shipments and higher raw material, outage and modernization-related costs. Prices are expected to remain in line with the third quarter. Fourth quarter results are expected to decrease for U. S. Steel Europe (USSE). Prices and shipments are expected to remain comparable to the third quarter levels and costs are expected to increase slightly. Two planned blast furnace outages will continue to limit raw steel production. In conjunction with efforts to increase productivity, we are commencing a voluntary early retirement program at U. S. Steel Kosice (USSK), which we anticipate will generate substantial future cost savings. We will not know the employee response to this program and the amount of the resulting fourth quarter charge until later this year. Fourth quarter results for Tubular are expected to be consistent with third quarter results as average realized prices and costs are expected to improve and shipments should decrease, due primarily to continued high inventory levels and year-end seasonal effects. Concerning Stelco, the Stelco shareholders have approved the transaction, required regulatory approvals have been obtained, and we expect to complete this transaction and commence the integration later this week. Results for Stelco will be included in our Flat-rolled segment as of the date of the acquisition, and the above fourth quarter outlook does not include the Stelco operations.
This release contains forward-looking statements with respect to the acquisition of Stelco, market conditions, operating costs, shipments, prices and a voluntary early retirement program at USSK. Risks and uncertainties regarding the closing of the Stelco transaction include the approval of the Plan of Arrangement by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Some factors, among others, that could affect market conditions, costs, shipments and prices for both domestic operations and USSE include global product demand, prices and mix; global and company steel production levels; plant operating performance; the timing and completion of facility projects; natural gas and electricity prices and usage; raw materials and transportation availability and prices; the impact of fixed prices in energy and raw materials contracts (many of which have terms of one year or longer) as compared to shorter-term contracts and spot prices of steel products; changes in environmental, tax and other laws; employee strikes; energy outages or curtailments; and U.S. and global economic performance and political developments. Domestic steel shipments and prices could be affected by import levels and actions taken by the U.S. Government and its agencies. Economic conditions and political factors in Europe that may affect USSE's results include, but are not limited to, taxation, nationalization, inflation, currency fluctuations, increased regulation, export quotas, tariffs, and other protectionist measures. Factors that may affect the cost savings expected to result from the early retirement program at USSK include employee response to the program. In accordance with "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, cautionary statements identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements have been included in the Form 10-K of U. S. Steel for the year ended December 31, 2006, and in subsequent filings for U. S. Steel. A Statement of Operations (Unaudited), Cash Flow Statement (Unaudited), Condensed Balance Sheet (Unaudited) and Preliminary Supplemental Statistics (Unaudited) for U. S. Steel are attached. The company will conduct a conference call on third quarter earnings on Tuesday, October 30, at 2 p.m. EDT. To listen to the webcast of the conference call, visit the U. S.
