Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On June 12, 2009, United States Steel Corporation (the Corporation) entered into an amendment and restatement of its $750,000,000 Credit Agreement dated May 11, 2009 (the Amended Credit Agreement) with the lenders party thereto, the LC issuing banks party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as .  The Corporation simultaneously entered into a Security Agreement (the Security Agreement) with the Agent providing for a security interest in the majority of its domestic inventory.  In connection with the execution and delivery of the Amended Credit Agreement and the Security Agreement, the Corporation also entered into an intercreditor agreement (the Intercreditor Agreement) among U. S. Steel Receivables LLC (the Corporations wholly-owned special-purpose bankruptcy-remote subsidiary), PNC Bank, National Association, The Bank of Nova Scotia and the Agent in its capacity as the collateral agent under the Amended Credit Agreement (the Collateral Agent).
Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent (the Agent)
The Amended Credit Agreement establishes a borrowing base formula for borrowings and eliminates the previous financial covenants that consisted of interest and leverage coverage ratios.  The Amended Credit Agreement contains a new financial covenant requiring the Corporation to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio (consolidated EBITDA less certain capital expenditures and cash income tax expense to certain fixed charges as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) of at least 1.10 to 1.00 for the most recent four consecutive quarters when availability under the Amended Credit Agreement is less than the greater of 15% of the total aggregate commitments and $112.5 million.  The Amended Credit Agreement includes revised pricing and other customary terms and conditions, and will expire on May 11, 2012.  The borrowing base formula, the elimination of the interest and leverage covenants and the addition of the new fixed charge ratio will become effective upon the delivery of certain borrowing base documentation that the Corporation expects to deliver later this month.  The facility will also be reduced to $734,500,000 to reflect the termination of the Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank commitment.  Pursuant to the Security Agreement, the Corporation grants the Collateral Agent a security interest in a majority of its domestic inventory, certain accounts receivable and related collateral.  The Intercreditor Agreement addresses the priority of the security interests in the Corporations domestic receivables between The Bank of Nova Scotia in its capacity as the collateral agent under the Corporations second amended and restated receivables purchase agreement dated as of September 27, 2006 and the Collateral Agent.
The Amended Credit Agreement, the Security Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3.

Section 2.16.  .  (a) .  On the Effective Date, the LC Issuing Bank shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have sold to each of the Lenders, and each of the Lenders shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have purchased from the LC Issuing Bank, a participation (on the terms specified in this Section) in each Existing Letter of Credit equal to such Lenders Percentage thereof.  Concurrently with such sale, the participations sold to the Existing Lenders pursuant to the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement shall be automatically cancelled without further action by any of the parties hereto.  Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Existing Letters of Credit pursuant to this subsection is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each payment by a Lender to acquire such participations shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit for its own account, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the LC Issuing Bank, from time to time during the Revolving Credit Period.  If the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, the LC Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit are not consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.
Letters of Credit
General
 
        .  To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the LC Issuing Bank) to the LC Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with Section 2.16(c)), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit.  If requested by the LC Issuing Bank, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on the LC Issuing Banks standard form (with such changes as are agreed by such LC Issuing Bank and the Borrower) in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit.  A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if, (i) no Defaulting Lender shall then exist (unless such Defaulting Lenders share (based on the ratio of such Defaulting Lenders Commitment to the aggregate Commitments then in effect) of the LC Exposure has been cash collateralized by the Borrower (pursuant to documentation satisfactory to the LC Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower)) and (ii) (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that) after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, (A) the LC Exposure will not exceed $300,000,000 and (B) the Total Outstanding Amount will not exceed the Maximum Facility Availability on such date.
(b)
Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal or Extension; Certain Conditions
pro rata
 
42
 
        .  Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or before the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date that is one year after such Letter of Credit is issued (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days before the Termination Date; that a Letter of Credit may have an expiry date later than that otherwise permitted by this clause (ii) so long as all LC Exposures with respect to such Letter of Credit are cash collateralized not later than the fifth Business Day prior to the Termination Date in the manner specified in subsection (j).
(c)
Expiration Date
provided
 
        .  Effective upon the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the LC Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the LC Issuing Bank grants to each Lender, and each Lender acquires from the LC Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lenders Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn thereunder.  Pursuant to such participations, each Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the LC Issuing Bank, such Lenders Percentage of (i) each LC Disbursement made by the LC Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in Section 2.16(e) and (ii) any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason.  Each Lenders obligation to acquire participations and make payments pursuant to this subsection is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or any reduction or termination of the Commitments, and each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
(d)
Participations
 
43
 
        .  If the LC Issuing Bank makes any LC Disbursement under a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying an amount equal to such LC Disbursement to the Administrative Agent not later than 2:00 P.M. (Prevailing Eastern Time) on the day that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement before 10:00 A.M., Prevailing Eastern Time, on such day, or, if such notice has not been received by the Borrower before such time on such day, then not later than Noon (Prevailing Eastern Time) on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received before 10:00 A.M. (Prevailing Eastern Time) on the day of receipt, or (ii) the next Business Day, if such notice is not received before such time on the day of receipt; that, if such LC Disbursement is at least $500,000, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request that such payment be made with the proceeds of a Base Rate Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrowers obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Base Rate Borrowing.  If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lenders Percentage thereof.  Promptly after it receives such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as is provided in with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.04(d) shall apply, , to such payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the LC Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders.  If a Lender makes a payment pursuant to this subsection to reimburse the LC Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than by funding Base Rate Loans as heretofore contemplated), (i) such payment will not constitute a Loan and will not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement and (ii) such Lender will be subrogated to its pro rata share of the LC Issuing Banks claim against the Borrower for such reimbursement.  Promptly after the Administrative Agent receives any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this subsection, the Administrative Agent will distribute such payment to the LC Issuing Bank or, if Lenders have made payments pursuant to this subsection to reimburse the LC Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the LC Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.
(e)
Reimbursement
provided
Section 2.04
mutatis
mutandis
 
        .  The Borrowers obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in Section 2.16(e) shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the LC Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of set-off against, the Borrowers obligations hereunder.  None of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the LC Issuing Bank and their respective Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the LC Issuing Bank; that the foregoing shall not excuse the LC Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the LC Issuing Banks failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.  In the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the LC Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the LC Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the LC Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either (A) accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or (B) refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
(f)
Obligations Absolute
provided
 
44
 
        .  The LC Issuing Bank shall, promptly after its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit.  The LC Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the LC Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement pursuant thereto; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice will not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the LC Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
(g)
Disbursement Procedures
provided
 
        .  Unless the Borrower reimburses an LC Disbursement in full on the day it is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the day on which such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the day on which the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to Base Rate Loans; that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to Section 2.16(e), then such amount shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the Base Rate for such day.  Interest accrued pursuant to this subsection shall be for the account of the LC Issuing Bank, except that a pro rata share of interest accrued on and after the day that any Lender reimburses the LC Issuing Bank for a portion of such LC Disbursement pursuant to Section 2.16(e) shall be for the account of such Lender.
(h)
Interim Interest
provided
 
45
 
      .  The LC Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced LC Issuing Bank and the successor LC Issuing Bank.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement.  At the time any such replacement becomes effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced LC Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.08(b).  On and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor LC Issuing Bank will have all the rights and obligations of the LC Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term LC Issuing Bank will be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous LC Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous LC Issuing Banks, as the context shall require.  After an LC Issuing Bank is replaced, it will remain a party hereto and will continue to have all the rights and obligations of an LC Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it before such replacement, but will not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
(i)
Replacement of LC Issuing Bank
 
      .  If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposures representing more than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this subsection, the Borrower shall deposit in a Cash Collateral Account an amount in cash equal to 102% of the total LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral will become effective immediately, and such deposit will become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (i) or (j) of Article 7.

        The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the type thereof and each Interest Period (if any) applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lenders share thereof.
(b)
 
46
 
        The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this Section shall be evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; that any failure by any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not affect the Borrowers obligation to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(c)
prima
facie
provided
 
        Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by one or more promissory notes.  In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note(s) payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent.  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note(s) and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

Section 2.18.  .  (a) If a Change in Control of the Borrower shall occur, the Borrower will, within one Business Day after the occurrence thereof, give the Administrative Agent notice thereof, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof.  Such notice shall describe in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances giving rise thereto and the date of such Change in Control and each Lender may, by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (a ) given not later than ten days after the date of such Change in Control, terminate its Commitment, which shall be terminated, and declare any Loans held by it (together with accrued interest thereon) and any other amounts payable hereunder for its account to be, and such Loans and such amounts shall become, due and payable, in each case on the day following delivery of such Termination Notice (or if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day), without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.
Change in Control
Termination Notice
 
        If the Commitment of any Lender is terminated pursuant to this Section at a time when any Letter of Credit is outstanding, then (i) such Lender shall remain responsible to the LC Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit to the same extent as if its Commitment had not terminated and (ii) the Borrower shall pay to such Lender an amount in immediately available funds (which funds shall be held as collateral pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to such Lender) equal to such Lenders Percentage of the aggregate amount available for drawing under all Letters of Credit outstanding at such time.
(b)
 
47
 
Section 2.19.  .  If before the beginning of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:
Alternate Rate of Interest
 
      deposits in dollars in the applicable amounts are not being offered by the Administrative Agent in the London interbank market for such Interest Period; or
(i)
 
     Lenders having 50% or more of the aggregate principal amount of the Loans to be included in such Borrowing advise the Administrative Agent that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Loans for such Interest Period;
(ii)
 
the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, (i) the obligations of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Loans, or to continue to convert outstanding Loans as or into Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended and (ii) each outstanding Eurodollar Loan shall be converted into a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto.  Unless the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least two Business Days before the date of any affected Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it elects not to borrow on such date, such Borrowing shall instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing.
 
Section 2.20.  .  (a) If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs
 
      impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the LC Issuing Bank; or
(i)
 
     impose on any Lender or the LC Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
(ii)
 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the LC Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce any amount received or receivable by such Lender or the LC Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower shall pay to such Lender or the LC Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate it for such additional cost incurred or reduction suffered.
 
48
 
        If any Lender or the LC Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or the LC Issuing Banks capital or on the capital of such Lenders or the LC Issuing Banks holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the LC Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the LC Issuing Bank or such Lenders or the LC Issuing Banks holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or the LC Issuing Banks policies and the policies of such Lenders or the LC Issuing Banks holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time following receipt of the certificate referred to in subsection (c) of this Section, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender or the LC Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate it or its holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(b)
 
        A certificate of a Lender or the LC Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate it or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each such certificate shall contain a representation and warranty on the part of the Lender to the effect that such Lender has complied with its obligations pursuant to Section 2.24 hereof in an effort to eliminate or reduce such amount.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the LC Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
(c)
 
        Failure or delay by any Lender or the LC Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section will not constitute a waiver of its right to demand such compensation; that the Borrower will not be required to compensate a Lender or the LC Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased cost or reduction incurred more than 180 days before it notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased cost or reduction and of its intention to claim compensation therefor.  However, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased cost or reduction is retroactive, then the 180-day period heretofore referred to will be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
(d)
provided
 
49
 
Section 2.21.  .  If (a) any principal of any Eurodollar Loan is repaid on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default or a Change in Control), (b) any Eurodollar Loan is converted on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the Borrower fails to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto, or (d) any Eurodollar Loan is assigned on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.24, then the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for its loss, cost and expense attributable to such event.  In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost and expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the end of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have begun on the date of such failure), over (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the beginning of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market.  A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
Break Funding Payments
 
Section 2.22.  .  (a) All payments by the Borrower under the Loan Documents shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that, if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable will be increased as necessary so that, after all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) are made, each relevant Lender Party receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
Taxes
provided
 
        In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(b)
 
        The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender Party, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by such Lender Party with respect to any payment by or obligation of the Borrower under the Loan Documents (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of any such payment delivered to the Borrower by a Lender Party on its own behalf, or by the Administrative Agent on behalf of a Lender Party, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  If the Borrower has indemnified any Lender Party pursuant to this Section 2.22(c), such Lender Party shall take such steps as the Borrower shall reasonably request (at the Borrowers expense) to assist the Borrower in recovering the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes and any penalties or interest attributable thereto; that no Lender Party shall be required to take any action pursuant to this Section 2.22(c) unless, in the judgment of such Lender Party, such action (i) would not subject such Lender Party to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (ii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender Party.
(c)
provided
 
50
 
        As soon as practicable after the Borrower pays any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(d)
 
        Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the laws of the United States, or any treaty to which the United States is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.  If any such Foreign Lender becomes subject to any Tax because it fails to comply with this subsection as and when prescribed by applicable law, the Borrower shall take such steps (at such Foreign Lenders expense) as such Foreign Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Foreign Lender to recover such Tax.
(e)
 
Section 2.23.  .  (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it under the Loan Documents (whether of principal, interest or fees, or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or amounts payable under Section 2.20, 2.21 or 2.22(c) or otherwise) before the time expressly required under the relevant Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, before 2:00 P.M. (Prevailing Eastern Time)), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim.  Any amount received after such time on any day may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York, except payments to be made directly to the LC Issuing Bank as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.20, 2.21, 2.22 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payment received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly after receipt thereof.  Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, Base Rate Loans or of fees shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day.  Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, Eurodollar Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless such Business Day falls in another calendar month, in which case the date for payment thereof shall be the next preceding Business Day.  If the date for any payment of principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest thereon shall be payable for such extended time.  All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in dollars.

        If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
(b)
 
        If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or any of its participations in LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this subsection shall apply).  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

        Unless, before the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of one or more Lender Parties hereunder, the Administrative Agent receives from the Borrower notice that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance on such assumption, distribute to each relevant Lender Party the amount due to it.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, each Lender Party severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender Party with interest thereon, for each day from and including the day such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the day it repays the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
(d)
 
        If any Lender fails to make any payment required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent or the LC Issuing Bank pursuant to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such obligations until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

Section 2.24.  .  (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.20, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.22, then such Lender shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or eliminate the amount of such compensation or additional amount, including by designating a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or by assigning its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates; that no Lender shall be required to take any action pursuant to this Section 2.24(a) unless, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment or other action (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.20 or 2.22, as the case may be, in the future, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

        If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.20, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.22, or if any Lender is a Specified Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Commitment is being assigned, the LC Issuing Bank), which consents shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.20 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.22, such assignment will result in a material reduction in such compensation or payments.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment cease to apply.
(b)
provided
 
        At any time a Lender is a Specified Lender, the Borrower may terminate in full the Commitment of such Specified Lender by giving notice to such Specified Lender and the Administrative Agent (which notice shall specify the effective date of such termination); provided, that (i) at the time of such termination, no Event of Default exists; (ii) concurrently with such termination, the Borrower shall prepay all outstanding Loans of such Specified Lender together with accrued interest thereon and accrued fees and any other amounts payable for the account of such Specified Lender hereunder; and (iii) if, on the effective date of such termination, any Letter of Credit is outstanding, the conditions specified in Section 4.02 would be satisfied (after giving effect to such termination) were each such Letter of Credit issued on such date.  Upon satisfaction of the conditions specified in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), the Commitment of such Specified Lender shall terminate on the effective date specified in such notice, its participation in the LC Exposure shall terminate on such effective date and the participations of the other Lenders in the LC Exposure shall be redetermined as of such termination date as if the outstanding Letters of Credit had been issued and the unreimbursed LC Disbursements had been paid or satisfied on such termination date.

Section 9.02.  .  (a) No failure or delay by any Lender Party in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Lender Parties under the Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by subsection (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the making of a Loan nor the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of a Letter of Credit shall be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether any Lender Party had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
Waivers; Amendments
 
        No Loan Document or provision thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the case of this Agreement, by an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any other Loan Document, by an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the parties thereto with the consent of the Required Lenders; that no such agreement shall:

To the Lenders and the Agent
Hereinafter defined
c/o JPMorgan Chase Bank, N. A.
as Administrative Agent
270 Park Avenue
New York, New York 10017
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I am the Assistant General CounselCorporate of United States Steel Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation").  This opinion is being delivered pursuant to Section 4.01(b) of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of May 11, 2007 and amended and restated as of June 12, 2009 among the Corporation, the Lenders party thereto, the LC Issuing Banks party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Administrative Agent and Collateral (the Agreement).  Except as otherwise indicated herein, capitalized terms used in this opinion letter are defined as set forth in the Agreement.
 
I or persons under my supervision have examined originals or copies of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law as they and I have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion.  Such documents include, without limitation, the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
B-1
 
 
 
 
The documents listed in items 1 through [7] of the foregoing list are sometimes hereinafter referred to as the Loan Documents.  The documents referred to in items [5 through 7] of the foregoing list are sometimes hereinafter referred to as the Account Control Agreements.  The Security Agreement and the Account Control Agreements are sometimes hereinafter referred to as the Collateral Agreements.
 
In rendering this opinion I made the following assumptions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
B-2
 
Based on and subject to the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
 
1.           The Corporation is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and is duly qualified and in good standing as a foreign corporation authorized to do business in each jurisdiction set forth on Annex I hereto.  The Corporation has all powers and all material governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to conduct its business as now conducted except to the extent failure to have such governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals, individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
2.           The execution, delivery and performance by the Corporation of the Agreement, [the Notes] and the other Loan Documents and the other Financing Transactions are within the Corporations powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary action, require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and do not and will not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or of the Corporations certificate of incorporation, charter or by-laws or to my knowledge of any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other instrument binding upon the Corporation or any of its properties or give rise to a right thereunder to require the Corporation to make any payment or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien (other than the Liens created by the Security Documents) on any asset of the Corporation or any Subsidiary.
 
3.           Each Loan Document to which the Corporation is a party has been duly executed and delivered by the Corporation.  Each Loan Document [(other than the Notes)] constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Corporation and the Notes constitute valid and binding obligations of the Corporation, in each case enforceable in accordance with its terms.
 
4.           The Security Agreement is effective to create, in favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties, as security for the Secured Obligations, a valid security interest (the Security Interest) in the Borrowers right, title and interest in that portion of the Collateral, as defined in the Security Agreement (the Collateral), described therein in which a security interest may be created pursuant to Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of New York on the date hereof (the UCC).
 
5.           To the extent that the filing of a Uniform Commercial Code financing statement in the State of Delaware is effective under the UCC to perfect a security interest in the Collateral, the Security Interest in the Collateral will be perfected upon the filing of Uniform Commercial Code financing statement in the
forms attached hereto as Exhibit A (the Financing Statement) in the filing office located in the State of Delaware that is indicated thereon, except that (a) continuation statements with respect to such Financing Statement must be filed within the period of six months prior to the expiration of five years from the date of filing of such Financing Statement and, in turn, the date of filing of any such continuation statement and (b) additional filings may be necessary if the Borrower changes its name or its location (as defined in Section 9-307 of the UCC).
 
 
B-3
 
 
6.           Upon the due execution and delivery of the Account Control Agreements by the parties thereto, the Security Interest in the accounts listed therein will be perfected.
 
7.           Except as set forth in (a) the Borrowers 2008 Form 10-K and (b) the Borrowers Latest Form 10-Q, there is no action, suit arbitration or other proceeding, inquiry or investigation, at law or in equity, or before or by any court, public board or body, arbitrator or arbitral body or other Governmental Authority, pending against the Corporation or of which the Corporation has otherwise received official notice or which to my knowledge is threatened against the Corporation, wherein there is a reasonable possibility of an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding that would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or that involves any of the Loan Documents or the Financing Transactions.  Since the dates of the respective descriptions of proceedings contained in the reports identified in the immediately preceding sentence, there has been no change in the status of such proceedings that would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or that involves any of the Loan Documents or the Financing Transactions.
 
8.           The Corporation is not (a) an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or a company controlled (directly or indirectly) by or acting on behalf of any Person which is an investment company within the meaning of said Act, or (b) to the best of my knowledge, otherwise subject to any regulatory scheme which restricts its ability to incur Debt.
 
The opinions set forth in paragraphs 3 through 6 are qualified by the effect of: (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium and other similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally, (ii) general principles of equity, and (iii) applicable rules of law which: (A) limit or affect the enforcement of provisions of a contract that purport to require waiver of the obligations of good faith, fair dealing, diligence and reasonableness, (B) limit the availability of a remedy under certain circumstances where another remedy has been elected, (C) limit the enforceability of provisions releasing, exculpating, or exempting a party from, or requiring indemnification of a party for, liability for its
own action or inaction, (D) limit the enforceability of  any provision purporting to disallow waivers by course of conduct or oral authorization or to excuse failure to act or delay in acting by any party, (E) limit the enforceability of any provision purporting to authorize conclusive or sole determinations by the Lenders or the Administrative Agent, (F) limit the enforceability of any provision waiving marshaling or redemption rights relative to the Collateral and (G) may, where less than all of a contract may be unenforceable, limit the enforceability of the balance of the contract to circumstances in which the unenforceable portion is not an essential part of the agreed exchange.
 
B-4
 
I note the possible unenforceability in whole or in part of certain remedial provisions of the Collateral Documents, although the inclusion of such provisions does not render any of the Collateral Documents invalid, and each of the Collateral Documents contains, in my judgment, adequate remedial provisions for the practical realization of the rights and benefits afforded thereby.
 
The foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Federal laws of the United States of America and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.  As the Loan Documents are by their terms governed by the laws of the State of New York, the foregoing opinion should be understood to conclude that: (a) a Pennsylvania court or a Federal court sitting in Pennsylvania would give effect to the choice of New York law to govern the Loan Documents and (b) under the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania each of the Loan Documents [(other than the Notes)] constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Corporation and the Notes constitute valid and binding obligations of the Corporation.
 
This Opinion Letter speaks only as of its date.  I have no obligation to advise you (or any third party) of changes in law or fact occurring after the date of this Opinion Letter.
 
This Opinion Letter may be relied upon by you and the Lenders only in connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and may not be used or relied upon by you or any other person (other than your and their lawful successors and assigns) for any other purpose whatsoever without in each instance my prior written consent.
 
Very truly yours,

Significant Subsidiary
 
(1)           The registrants and its other subsidiaries investments in and advances to the subsidiary exceed 10 percent of the total assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year (for a proposed business combination to be accounted for as a pooling of interests, this condition is also met when the number of common shares exchanged or to be exchanged by the registrant exceeds 10 percent of its total common shares outstanding at the date the combination is initiated); or
 
(2)           The registrants and its other subsidiaries proportionate share of the total assets (after intercompany eliminations) of the subsidiary exceeds 10 percent of the total assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year; or
 
(3)           The registrants and its other subsidiaries equity in the income from continuing operations before income taxes, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of the subsidiary exceeds 10 percent of such income of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for the most recently completed fiscal year.
 
: A registrant that files its financial statements in accordance with or provides a reconciliation to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles shall make the prescribed tests using amounts determined under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  A foreign private issuer that files its financial statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB shall make the prescribed tests using amounts determined under IFRS as issued by the IASB.

: For purposes of making the prescribed income test the following guidance should be applied:
Computational Note
 
1.           When a loss has been incurred by either the parent and its subsidiaries consolidated or the tested subsidiary, but not both, the equity in the income or loss of the tested subsidiary should be excluded from the income of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for purposes of the computation.
 
2.           If income of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for the most recent fiscal year is at least 10 percent lower than the average of the income
for the last five fiscal years, such average income should be substituted for purposes of the computation.  Any loss years should be omitted for purposes of computing average income.
 
3.           Where the test involves combined entities, as in the case of determining whether summarized financial data should be presented, entities reporting losses shall not be aggregated with entities reporting income.

(b)        If at any time any portion of any monies collected or received by the Collateral Agent would, but for the provisions of this Section 7(b), be payable pursuant to Section 7(a) in respect of an Unliquidated Secured Obligation, the Collateral Agent shall not apply any monies to pay such Unliquidated Secured Obligation but instead shall request the holder thereof, at least 10 days before each proposed distribution hereunder, to notify the Collateral Agent as to the maximum amount of such Unliquidated Secured Obligation if then ascertainable (, in the case of a letter of credit, the maximum amount available for subsequent drawings thereunder).  If the holder of such Unliquidated Secured Obligation does not notify the Collateral Agent of the maximum ascertainable amount thereof at least two Domestic Business Days before such distribution, such Unliquidated Secured Obligation will not be entitled to share in such distribution.  If such holder does so notify the Collateral Agent as to the maximum ascertainable amount thereof, the Collateral Agent will allocate to such holder a portion of the monies to be distributed in such distribution, calculated as if such Unliquidated Secured Obligation were outstanding in such maximum ascertainable amount.  However, the Collateral Agent will not apply such portion of such monies to pay such Unliquidated Secured Obligation, but instead will hold such monies or invest such monies in Liquid Investments.  All such monies and Liquid Investments and all proceeds thereof will constitute Collateral hereunder, but will be subject to distribution in accordance with this Section 7(b) rather than Section 7(a).  The Collateral Agent will hold all such monies and Liquid Investments and the net proceeds thereof in trust until all or part of such Unliquidated Secured Obligation becomes a Liquidated Secured Obligation, whereupon the Collateral Agent at the request of the relevant Secured Party will apply the amount so held in trust to pay such Liquidated Secured Obligation; that, if the other Secured Obligations theretofore paid pursuant to the same clause of Section 7(a) (, clause , or ) were not paid in full, the Collateral Agent will apply the amount so held in trust to pay the same percentage of such Liquidated Secured Obligation as the percentage of such other Secured Obligations theretofore paid pursuant to the same clause of Section 7(a).  If (i) the holder of such Unliquidated Secured Obligation shall advise the Collateral Agent that no portion thereof remains in the category of an Unliquidated Secured Obligation and (ii) the Collateral Agent still holds any amount held in trust pursuant to this Section 7(b)in respect of such Unliquidated Secured Obligation (after paying all amounts payable pursuant to the preceding sentence with respect to any portions thereof that became Liquidated Secured Obligations), such remaining amount will be applied by the Collateral Agent in the order of priorities set forth in Section 7(a).

(ii)                 the amount of any and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including transfer taxes and reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel and other experts, that the Collateral Agent may incur in connection with (x) the administration or enforcement of the Security Documents, including such expenses as are incurred to preserve the value of the Collateral or the validity, perfection, rank or value of any Transaction Lien, (y) the collection, sale or other disposition of any Collateral or (z) the exercise by the Collateral Agent of any of its rights or powers under the Security Documents;
 
(iii)                 the amount of any fees that the Lien Grantor shall have agreed in writing to pay to the Collateral Agent and that shall have become due and payable in accordance with such written agreement; and
 
(iv)                 the amount required to indemnify the Collateral Agent for, or hold it harmless and defend it against, any loss, liability or expense (including the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of its counsel and any experts or sub-agents appointed by it hereunder) incurred or suffered by the Collateral Agent in connection with the Security Documents, except to the extent that such loss, liability or expense arises from the Collateral Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct or a breach of any duty that the Collateral Agent has under this Agreement (after giving effect to Sections 10 and 11).
 
Any such amount not paid to the Collateral Agent on demand will bear interest for each day thereafter until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2.00% plus the Base Rate for such day plus the Applicable Rate that would, in the absence of an Event of Default, be applicable to the Base Rate Loans for such day.
 
(b)        If any transfer tax, documentary stamp tax or other tax is payable in connection with any transfer or other transaction provided for in the Security Documents, the Lien Grantor will pay such tax and provide any required tax stamps to the Collateral Agent or as otherwise required by law.

(c)        to sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of the same or the proceeds or avails thereof, as fully and effectually as if the Collateral Agent were the absolute owner thereof, and
 
(d)        to extend the time of payment of any or all thereof and to make any allowance or other adjustment with reference thereto;
 
that, except in the case of Collateral that is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, the Collateral Agent will give the Lien Grantor at least ten days prior written notice of the time and place of any public sale thereof or the time after which any private sale or other intended disposition thereof will be made.  Any such notice shall (i) contain the information specified in UCC Section 9-613, (ii) be Authenticated and (iii) be sent to the parties required to be notified pursuant to UCC Section 9-611(c); that, if the Collateral Agent fails to comply with this sentence in any respect, its liability for such failure shall be limited to the liability (if any) imposed on it as a matter of law under the UCC.
