The Company may, at its cost and in its name or in the name of the Issuer, prosecute or take any other action involving third persons which the Company deems necessary in order to ensure or protect the Company's rights under this Agreement; in such event, the Issuer will reasonably cooperate with the Company, but at the sole expense of the Company. In case any actions or proceedings are brought against the Issuer or the Trustee in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, the party seeking indemnity shall promptly (but in any event within 15 days of receipt of service) give notice of that action or proceeding to the Company enclosing copies of all papers served, and the Company upon receipt of that notice shall have the obligation and the right to assume the defense of the action or proceeding; provided, that failure of a party to give that notice shall not relieve the Company from any of its obligations under this Section unless that failure materially prejudices the defense of the action or proceeding by the Company. At its own expense, an indemnified party may employ separate counsel and participate in the defense. The Company shall not be liable for any settlement made without its consent. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be obligated to indemnify or hold harmless the Issuer or the Trustee for their gross negligence or willful misconduct. The foregoing indemnification is intended to and shall include the indemnification of all affected officials, directors, trustees, officers and employees of the Issuer and the Trustee, respectively. That indemnification is intended to and shall be enforceable by the Issuer and the Trustee, respectively, to the full extent permitted by law. Section 5.03. Company Not to Adversely Affect Exclusion From Gross Income of Interest on the Bonds. The Company hereby represents that it has taken and caused to be taken, and covenants that it will take and cause to be taken, all actions that may be required of it, alone or in conjunction with the Issuer, for the interest on the Bonds to be and to remain excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and represents that it has not taken or permitted to be taken on its behalf, and covenants that it will not take or permit to be taken on its behalf, any action that would adversely affect such excludability under the provisions of the Code. The Company also covenants that it will restrict the investment and reinvestment and the use of the proceeds of the Bonds in such manner and to such extent, if any, as may be necessary so that the Bonds will not constitute arbitrage bonds under Section 148 of the Code. The Company hereby covenants that on or before the ninetieth day following the date any of the Project Facilities are no longer being operated as qualifying exempt facilities under the Code (unless such facilities have simply ceased to be operated), or such later date as provided in the Indenture, the Company shall cause a related amount of Bonds to be redeemed pursuant to the Mandatory Redemption provision of the Bonds. Section 5.04. Company to Maintain its Existence; Mergers or Consolidations. The Company covenants that it will not merge or consolidate with any other legal entity or sell or convey all or substantially all of its assets to any other legal entity, except that the Company may merge or consolidate with, or sell or convey all or substantially all of its assets to any other legal entity, provided that (a) the Company shall be the continuing legal entity or the successor legal entity (if other than the Company) shall be a legal entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof, qualified to do business in the State of Indiana and such legal entity shall expressly assume the due and punctual payment of the Installment Payments hereunder in order to ensure timely and proper payment of the principal of and interest on all the Bonds, according to their tenor, and the due and punctual performance and observance of all the covenants and conditions of this Agreement to be performed by the Company and (b) the Company or such successor legal entity, as the case may be, shall not, immediately after such merger or consolidation, or such sale or conveyance, be in default in the performance of any such covenant or condition and no event which with the lapse of time, the giving of notice or both would constitute an Event of Default under Section 7.01 shall have occurred and be continuing. In case any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance and upon the assumption by the successor legal entity of the obligations under this Agreement and on the Bonds in accordance with the foregoing, such successor legal entity shall succeed to and be substituted for the Company, with the same effect as if it had been named herein as a party hereto, and the Company shall thereupon be relieved of any further obligations or liabilities hereunder and upon the Bonds and the Company as the predecessor legal entity may thereupon or at any time thereafter be dissolved, wound-up or liquidated. Section 5.05. Reports and Audits. The Company shall as soon as practicable but in no event later than six months after the end of each of its fiscal years, file with the Trustee and the Issuer, audited financial statements of the Company prepared as of the end of such fiscal year; provided that the Company may satisfy this requirement by its filing of such information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (www.sec.gov) and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (www.emma.msrb.org) in accordance with their respective filing requirements.

Any prepayment pursuant to this Section 6.01 shall either comply with the provisions of Article IX of the Indenture or result in redemption of the Bonds within 90 days of the date of prepayment. Nothing contained in this Section 6.01 shall prevent the payment of part of any of the Bonds pursuant to Article IV or Section 9.02 of the Indenture. Section 6.02. Option to Prepay Upon Extraordinary Optional Redemption Under the Indenture.

At the request of the Company or the Trustee, the Issuer shall take all steps required of it under the applicable provisions of the Indenture or the Bonds to effect the redemption of all or a portion of the Bonds pursuant to this Article VI; provided that, in such event, the Company shall reimburse the Issuer for its reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in complying with such request. Section 6.04. Release on Exercise of Option to Prepay Loan. Upon the payment of all amounts due hereunder pursuant to any option to prepay the loan granted in this Agreement, the Issuer shall upon receipt of the prepayment, deliver to the Company, if necessary, a release from the Trustee of the lien of the Indenture. ARTICLE VII. EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REMEDIES Section 7.01. Events of Default. Each of the following shall be an Event of Default: (a) The Company shall fail to pay the amounts required to be paid under Section 4.01 or 4.02 on the date specified therein. (b) Failure by the Company to observe and perform any covenant, condition or agreement on its part to be observed or performed, other than as referred to in Section 7.01(a), (other than certain representations, warranties and covenants regarding various matters relating to the tax status of the Bonds) for a period of 60 days after written notice specifying such failure and requesting that it be remedied shall have been given to the Company by the Issuer or the Trustee, unless the Issuer and the Trustee shall agree in writing to an extension of such time prior to its expiration; provided, however, if the failure stated in the notice cannot be corrected within the applicable period, it shall not constitute an Event of Default if corrective action is instituted by the Company within the applicable period and is being diligently pursued until the default is corrected. (c) The dissolution or liquidation of the Company or the voluntary initiation by the Company of any proceeding under any federal or state law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, arrangement, reorganization, readjustment of debt or any other form of debtor relief, or the initiation against the Company of any such proceeding which shall remain undismissed for 60 days, or failure by the Company to promptly have discharged any execution, garnishment or attachment of such consequence as would materially impair the ability of the Company to carry on its operations, or assignment by the Company for the benefit of creditors, or the entry by the Company into an agreement of composition with creditors or the failure generally by the Company to pay its debts as they become due. (d) The occurrence of an Event of Default as defined in the Indenture. Any declaration of default under subparagraph (c) and the exercise of remedies upon any such declaration will be subject to any applicable limitations of federal bankruptcy law affecting or precluding that declaration or exercise during the pendency of or immediately following any bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization proceedings. Section 7.02. Remedies on Default. Whenever an Event of Default shall have happened and be existing, any one or more of the following remedial steps may be taken: (a) if acceleration of the principal amount of the Bonds has been declared pursuant to Section 7.03 of the Indenture, the Trustee shall declare all Installment Payments to be immediately due and payable, whereupon the same shall become immediately due and payable; or (b) the Issuer or the Trustee may pursue all remedies now or hereafter existing at law or in equity to collect all amounts then due and thereafter to become due under this Agreement or to enforce the performance and observance of any other obligation or agreement of the Company under those instruments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee shall not be obligated to take any step that in its reasonable opinion will or might cause it to expend time or money or otherwise incur liability unless and until a satisfactory indemnity bond has been furnished to the Trustee at no cost or expense to it. Any amounts collected pursuant to action taken under this Section (except for amounts payable directly to the Issuer or the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.02, 5.02 or 7.04) shall be paid into the Bond Fund and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture or, if the Outstanding Bonds have been paid and discharged in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, shall be paid as provided in Section 9.01 of the Indenture for transfers of remaining amounts in the Bond Fund. The provisions of this Section are subject to the further limitation that the rescission by the Trustee of its declaration that all of the Bonds are immediately due and payable also shall constitute an annulment of any corresponding declaration made pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section and a waiver and rescission of the consequences of that declaration and of the Event of Default with respect to which that declaration has been made, provided that no such waiver or rescission shall extend to or affect any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon. Section 7.03. No Remedy Exclusive. No remedy conferred upon or reserved to the Issuer or the Trustee by this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any other available remedy or remedies, but each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given under this Agreement, now or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by statute. No delay or omission to exercise any right or power accruing upon any default shall impair that right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver thereof, but any such right and power may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. In order to entitle the Issuer or the Trustee to exercise any remedy reserved to it in this Article, it shall not be necessary to give any notice, other than any notice required by law or for which express provision is made herein. Section 7.04. Agreement to Pay Fees and Expenses. If an Event of Default should occur and the Issuer or the Trustee should incur expenses, including attorneys' fees, in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement or the collection of sums due thereunder, the Company shall reimburse the Issuer and the Trustee, as applicable, from the reasonable expenses so incurred upon demand. Section 7.05. No Waiver. No failure by the Issuer or the Trustee to insist upon the performance by the Company of any provision hereof shall constitute a waiver of their right to performance and no express waiver shall be deemed to apply to any other existing or subsequent right to remedy the failure by the Company to observe or comply with any provision hereof. Section 7.06. Notice of Default. The Company shall notify the Trustee immediately and in writing if it becomes aware of the occurrence of any Event of Default hereunder or of any fact, condition or event which, with the giving of notice or passage of time or both, would become an Event of Default.

Section 8.02. Amounts Remaining in Funds. Any amounts in the Bond Fund remaining unclaimed by the Holders of Bonds (whether at stated maturity, by redemption or pursuant to any mandatory sinking fund requirements or otherwise), shall be deemed to belong to and shall be paid, to the proper party pursuant to applicable escheat laws. Further, any other amounts remaining in the Bond Fund, the Clearing Fund and any other special fund for accounts created under this Agreement or the Indenture after all of the outstanding Bonds shall be deemed to have been paid and discharged under the provisions of the Indenture and all other amounts required to be paid under this Agreement and the Indenture have been paid, shall be paid to the Company to the extent that those moneys are in excess of the amounts necessary to effect the payment and discharge of the outstanding Bonds.

Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or any covenant, obligation or agreement contained herein is determined by a court to be invalid or unenforceable, that determination shall not affect any other provision, covenant, obligation or agreement, each of which shall be construed and enforced as if the invalid or unenforceable portion were not contained herein. That invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any valid and enforceable application thereof, and each such provision, covenant, obligation or agreement shall be deemed to be effective, operative, made, entered into or taken in the manner and to the full extent permitted by law.
