A certificate describing in reasonable detail such amounts and the basis for such Affected Person's demand for such amounts submitted to the Seller and the applicable Funding Agent by such Affected Person shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (b) If, due to either: (i) the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation occurring after the date hereof, (ii) compliance with any guideline or request occurring after the date hereof from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), or (iii) Basel II (whether the compliance by such Affected Person therewith was commenced prior to or after the date hereof), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Affected Person of agreeing to purchase or purchasing, or maintaining the ownership of, the Purchased Interest in respect of which Discount is computed by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, then, upon written demand by such Affected Person (accompanied by the certificate referred to in the next sentence, with a copy to the applicable Funding Agent), the Seller shall promptly pay to such Affected Person, from time to time as specified by such Affected Person, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Affected Person for such increased costs. A certificate describing, in reasonable detail, such amounts and the basis for such Affected Person's demand for such amounts submitted to the Seller and the applicable Funding Agent by such Affected Person shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (e) For the avoidance of doubt, any increase in cost and/or reduction in yield with respect to any Affected Person caused by regulatory capital allocation adjustments due to FASB's Interpretation 46 (revised December 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities and Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 or Statements of Financial Accounting Standards Nos. 166 and 167 (or any future statements or interpretations issued by FASB) shall be covered by this Section 1.9.

(h) Schedule II to the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as set forth on Schedule II attached hereto. (i) Clause (k) of Exhibit V to the Agreement is hereby amended by amended and restated in its entirety as follows: USS or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Seller) shall fail to pay any principal of or premium or interest on any of its Debt that is outstanding in a principal amount of at least $100,000,000 in the aggregate when the same becomes due and payable (whether by scheduled maturity, required prepayment, acceleration, demand or otherwise), and such failure shall continue after the applicable grace period, if any, specified in the agreement, mortgage, indenture or instrument relating to such Debt; it being agreed that, solely for purposes of this clause (k), the term "Subsidiaries" shall not include any entity that is not, directly or indirectly, wholly owned by the Servicer so long as the Servicer has no obligation to pay the applicable Debt of such entity in the event of a default by such entity; and SECTION 2. Additional Agreements.

Each of the Seller, the Servicer and the Purchaser Parties agree to consider all such proposals by the Servicer, and any counter-proposals by the Purchaser Parties, in good faith, and to implement any such amendments that may be necessary or appropriate to cure such potential noncompliance; provided that any such amendments could not, in such Purchaser Party's sole judgment, adversely affect the respective rights of such Purchaser Party under the Transaction Documents. SECTION 3. Agreement in Full Force and Effect as Amended. Except as specifically amended hereby, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. All references to the Agreement shall be deemed to mean the Agreement as modified hereby. This Amendment shall not constitute a novation of the Agreement, but shall constitute an amendment thereof.
