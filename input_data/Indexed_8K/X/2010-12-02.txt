Brockway Vice President & Treasurer Dated: December 2, 2010 EXHIBIT 99.1 [USS logo] Contact:Erin DiPietro 412.433.6845 Courtney Boone 412.433.6791 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE U. S. STEEL EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER JOHN H. GOODISH TO RETIRE PITTSBURGH, Dec. 2, 2010 - United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) today announced that Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer John H. Goodish has elected to retire effective Dec. 31, 2010, after 40 years of service with the company. Goodish, 62, joined U. S. Steel in 1970 as an accounting management trainee in Pittsburgh. After spending 17 years advancing through positions in the audit, accounting and finance areas of the company at locations in Pittsburgh and Indiana, he accepted an appointment as division manager - coke and chemicals at Gary Works in Gary, Ind., embarking on a 23-year operations career at facilities across the company. Among the numerous and increasingly responsible roles Goodish held during that time, he served as the operational head of the company's Gary Works and Mon Valley Works facilities in Pittsburgh before relocating to Slovakia in 2000 to lead U. S. Steel Kosice, the company's newly acquired and first Central European steelmaking operation. He was elected an officer of the company in March 2003 upon his return to the United States, serving as executive vice president - international and diversified businesses. He was appointed executive vice president - operations in June 2003 and assumed his current position in 2005. Commenting on Goodish's career, U. S. Steel Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John P. Surma said, "John's impact on our company will be felt and seen long after he retires, particularly in the influential leadership role he played in transforming our safety performance since 2003. The significant improvements we have made in this area are a direct reflection of his firm belief in safety as a core value and are reflected in every facet of the way we lead and operate our business. John's leadership in a series of acquisitions during the last decade has positioned our company for continued growth in North America and Central Europe and in the critically important tubular products sector, which includes the emerging shale basin developments. He has been among our most effective advocates for employee development, the evidence of which is apparent in the strong group of talented leaders who succeed him. We celebrate his many contributions to our company and industry. His friendship, loyalty and dedication were particularly meaningful to me during our long association. We all wish John, his wife, Kitty, and their family all the best in his well-earned retirement." -oOo- 2010-034 For more information about U. S. Steel, visit www.ussteel.com.
