Remedies on Default
 
(a)

(b)
 
the Issuer or the Trustee may pursue all remedies now or hereafter existing at law or in equity to collect all amounts then due and thereafter to become due under this Agreement or to enforce the performance and observance of any other obligation or agreement of the Company under those instruments.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee shall not be obligated to take any step that in its reasonable opinion will or might cause it to expend time or money or otherwise incur liability unless and until a satisfactory indemnity bond has been furnished to the Trustee at no cost or expense to it.  Any amounts collected pursuant to action taken under this Section (except for amounts payable directly to the Issuer or the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.02, 5.02 or 7.04) shall be paid into the Bond Fund and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture or, if the Outstanding Bonds have been paid and discharged in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, shall be paid as provided in Section 9.01 of the Indenture for transfers of remaining amounts in the Bond Fund.
 
The provisions of this Section are subject to the further limitation that the rescission by the Trustee of its declaration that all of the Bonds are immediately due and payable also shall constitute an annulment of any corresponding declaration made pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section and a waiver and rescission of the consequences of that declaration and of the Event of Default with respect to which that declaration has been made, provided that no such waiver or rescission shall extend to or affect any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.

No delay or omission to exercise any right or power accruing upon any default shall impair that right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver thereof, but any such right and power may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient.  In order to entitle the Issuer or the Trustee to exercise any remedy reserved to it in this Article, it shall not be necessary to give any notice, other than any notice required by law or for which express provision is made herein.
No Remedy Exclusive
