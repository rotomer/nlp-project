Forward-looking Statements These presentations contain forward -looking statements with respect to market conditions, operating costs, shipments, prices, capital spending, and employee benefit costs and payments. Although we believe that we are experiencing a gradual economic recovery, there are signs of con tinued economic issues in Europe and U. S. Steel cannot control or predict the impact. Other more no rmal factors that could affect market conditions, costs, shipments and prices for both North American and European operations include: (a) foreign currency fluctuations and related activities; (b) global product demand, prices and mix; (c) global and company steel production levels; (d) plant operating performance; (e) natural gas, electricity, raw materials and transportation prices, usage and availability; (f) international trade developm ents, including court decisions, legislation and agency decisions on petitions and sunsets; (g) the impact of fix ed prices in energy and raw materials contracts (many of which have terms of one year or longer) as compared to short-term contract and spot prices of steel products; (h) changes in environmental, tax, pension and other l aws; (i) the terms of collective bargaining agreements; (j) employee strikes or other labor issues; and (k) U.S. and global economic performance and political developments. Domestic steel shipments and prices could be affected by import levels and actions taken by the U.S. Government and its agencies, including those related to CO2 emissions, climate change and shale gas development. Economic conditions and political factors in E urope and Canada that may affect U. S. Steel Europe s and U. S. Steel Canada s results include, but are not limited to: (l) taxation (m) nationalization; (n) inflation; (o) government instability; (p) political unrest; (q) regulatory actions; and (r) quotas, tariffs, and other protectionist measures. Factors that may affe ct our decisions on strategic initiatives include, among other things: (s) the cost and availability of capital; (t ) the anticipated cost of additional facilities (whether built or acquired); and (u) current and anticipated product dema nd in the automotive and shale natural gas markets and availability of alternative products for such applic ations. Factors that may affect our ability to construct new facilities include: (v) levels of cash flow from o perations; (w) general economic conditions; (x) business conditions; (y) cost and availability of capital; (z) r eceipt of necessary permits; and (aa) unforeseen hazards such as contractor performance, material shortages, weat her conditions, explosions or fires. In accordance with safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1 995, cautionary statements identifying important factors, but not necessarily al l factors, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward -looking statements have been included in U. S. Steel s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and in subsequent filings for U.S.Steel. United States Steel Corporation 2
