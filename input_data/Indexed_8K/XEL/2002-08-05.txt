Item 5. Other Events
On July 25, 2002, Xcel Energy Inc. issued a press release, which was filed as Exhibit 99.01 to Current Report on Form 8-K dated July 25, 2002. The following items represent an update to the information contained in that press release and Current Report on Form 8-K:
Agreement with Xcel Energy Lenders
Xcel Energy announced Monday that it had signed agreements with its lenders to eliminate cross-default provisions in its bank credit agreements. Xcel Energy's bank agreements consist of a 364-day credit facility in the amount of $400 million expiring in November 2002 and a five-year credit facility in the amount of $400 million expiring in November 2005. The agreements finalized late last week remove key provisions in Xcel Energy's credit facilities that would have constrained Xcel Energy's ability to access capital due to difficulties faced by its NRG subsidiary in complying with the terms of its own credit facilities. NRG's debt was downgraded recently to below investment grade by two major rating agencies. Absent waivers or modifications, NRG's inability to meet the cash collateral demands following the downgrade would result in defaults under various agreements and credit facilities at the NRG level, which, in turn, could have cross-defaulted Xcel Energy's $800 million bank facilities. The agreements reached with Xcel Energy's lenders remove this linkage between NRG's agreements and credit facilities and those at Xcel Energy by removing the cross-default provisions. As part of its agreements with its lenders, Xcel Energy has agreed that its board of directors will review its dividend policy. While the board could decide to alter the dividend, currently the board has made no decision. A copy of the press release announcing the signing of the agreements is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.01. The agreements are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.02 and 99.03.
Class Action Lawsuit
On July 31, 2002, a lawsuit purporting to be a class action on behalf of purchasers of Xcel Energy common stock between Jan. 31, 2001 and July 26, 2002, was filed in the United States District Court in Minnesota. The complaint named Xcel Energy; Wayne H. Brunetti, chairman, president and chief executive officer; Edward J. McIntyre, vice president and chief financial officer and former chairman, James J. Howard as defendants. Among other things, the complaint alleges violations of Section 10b of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 related to allegedly false and misleading disclosures concerning various issues, including "round trip" energy trades and the existence of cross-default provisions in Xcel Energy's and its subsidiary, NRG Energy's, credit agreements with lenders. The defendants deny any liability and maintain they have made full and complete disclosures in compliance with applicable laws.
Xcel Energy Liquidity
In June 2002, Standard & Poor's Rating Services lowered the short-term rating on the commercial paper of Xcel Energy and its utility subsidiaries to A-3 from A-2. In general, the market for commercial paper that is rated either below A-2 by Standard & Poor's or below P-2 by Moody's Investors Services is limited. Xcel Energy and its utility subsidiaries used cash or existing credit facilities to repay approximately $723 million of commercial paper in July 2002.
As of July 31, 2002, Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries collectively had access to approximately $1.1 billion of cash (including available capacity under existing credit lines), consisting of: $288 million at Xcel Energy; $279 million at Southwestern Public Service Company; $150 million at Public Service Company of Colorado; $95 million at Northern States Power Company-MN; and $270 million at NRG. Xcel and its subsidiaries intend to continue taking steps to enhance their liquidity position.

EXHIBIT 99.01 [XCEL ENERGY LOGO] U.S. Bancorp Center 800 Nicollet Mall Minneapolis, MN 55402-2023 XCEL ENERGY REACHES KEY AGREEMENTS WITH LENDERS Banks eliminate cross-default provision between Xcel Energy and NRG MINNEAPOLIS, August 5, 2002 - Xcel Energy (NYSE: XEL) announced Monday that it had signed agreements with its lenders to eliminate a cross-default provision in its two bank lines-of-credit for which Bank of New York serves as agent. "We're delighted that we were able reach these agreements," said Wayne Brunetti, Xcel Energy chairman, president and CEO. "This was a critical step for the company and gives us the added financial flexibility we need." Brunetti emphasized that the core of Xcel Energy "will always be its utility operations. This agreement should make it clear that we have the needed financial and legal separation between NRG and the Xcel Energy holding company." These agreements remove a key provision that had constrained Xcel Energy's ability to access capital markets due to NRG's financial condition. Xcel Energy has access to about $200 million remaining on its lines of credit. These lines consist of two bank facilities of $400 million each, one expiring in November 2002 and the other in November 2005. Xcel Energy renegotiated its $800 million bank credit facilities when it appeared that NRG would be unable to meet cash collateral demands in the event it were downgraded to below investment grade. NRG's debt recently was downgraded to below investment grade by three credit rating agencies. In the coming weeks, Xcel Energy will continue to focus on improving NRG's financial strength. NRG is actively working with its lenders to modify the cash collateral requirements in its current arrangements. Xcel Energy's immediate goal is to obtain extensions of NRG's collateral obligations in anticipation of asset sales and other cash generating measures. As part of the agreements with its lenders, the company has agreed that its board of directors will review the company's dividend policy. While the board could decide to alter the dividend, no decision has been made by the board.

(a) Commitment to Lend. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each Bank agrees to make, from time to time during the period from the Agreement Date through the Termination Date, RC Loans to the Borrower, provided that (i) the sum of (A) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Bank's RC Loans and (B) the aggregate amount of such Bank's Letter of Credit Participations shall not at any time exceed such Bank's Commitment at such time and (ii) the sum of (A) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Participations shall not exceed at any time the aggregate amount of the Commitments at such time. Subject to Section 1.07 and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, the RC Loans may, at the option of the Borrower, be made as, and from time to time continued as or converted into, Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate Loans of any permitted Type, or any combination thereof. (b) Manner of Request. In order to request RC Loans, the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice (which shall be irrevocable) no later than 10:00 a.m. (New York time) on, in the case of Base Rate Loans, the requested date for the making of such RC Loans, and, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, the third Eurodollar Business Day before the requested date for the making of such RC Loans.

Upon receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of the amount and Type of each RC Loan to be made by such Bank on the requested date specified therein. (c) Funding by the Banks. Not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on each requested date for the making of RC Loans, each Bank shall, if it has received the notice contemplated by Section 1.01(b) on or prior to 12:00 noon (New York time) on such date, in the case of Base Rate Loans, or on or prior to its close of business on the third Eurodollar Business Day before such date, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, make available to the Administrative Agent, in Dollars in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office, the RC Loans to be made by such Bank on such date.
(d) Disbursement to the Borrower. All RC Loans made available to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 1.01(c) shall be disbursed by the Administrative Agent not later than 3:00 p.m. (New York time) on the requested date therefor in Dollars in funds immediately available to the Borrower by credit to an account of the Borrower at the Administrative Agent's Office or in such other manner as may have been specified in the applicable notice and as shall be acceptable to the Administrative Agent. Section 1.02 Bid Rate Loans. (a) Right to Request. The Borrower may request the Banks to make, from time to time during the period from the Agreement Date through the Termination Date, Bid Rate Loans to the Borrower; provided that the sum of (i) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Participations shall not exceed at any time the aggregate amount of the Commitments at such time. (b) Manner of Request. In order to request Bid Rate Loans, the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent a request for Bid Rate Loans no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York time) on the Business Day prior to the Bid Rate Loan Date. Each such request shall be submitted substantially in the form of Schedule 1.02(b) and shall specify (i) the Bid Rate Loan Date, which shall be a Business Day, (ii) the aggregate principal amount of each Type of requested Bid Rate Loans and (iii) the duration of the Interest Periods (each of which shall end on a Business Day (x) no earlier than 7 days and no later than 180 days after the Bid Rate Loan Date and (y) no later than the Termination Date) for each Type of requested Bid Rate Loans. Upon receipt of a timely request for Bid Rate Loans on a Business Day, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Bank of the contents thereof no later than 2:30 p.m. (New York time) on such Business Day. (c) Submission of Offers by the Banks. Each Bank may, in its sole and absolute discretion, submit one or more offers to make each Type of requested Bid Rate Loan in response to a request for Bid Rate Loans. Offers shall be irrevocable (but Loans to be made pursuant thereto shall be subject to Article 2), except with the written consent of the Administrative Agent given on the written instructions of the Borrower, and may not be modified except to correct a manifest error. Offers shall (i) be submitted substantially in the form of Schedule 1.02(c), (ii) identify the Bank making such offer, (iii) identify the request for Bid Rate Loans to which such offer relates, (iv) specify the Types of Bid Rate Loans such Bank is making an offer for, (v) for each such Type of Bid Rate Loans, specify (A) the principal amount, or the maximum and minimum principal amounts, of the Bid Rate Loan such Bank is willing make (which amounts, singly or in the aggregate, may exceed such Bank's Commitment at such time) and (B) the rate of interest per annum on the Bid Rate Loan that such Bank is willing to accept, and (vi) be submitted by telecopier to the Administrative Agent no later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the Bid Rate Loan Date, except that offers for requested Bid Rate Loans submitted by a Bank that is the Administrative Agent or any Affiliate thereof shall be submitted not later than one half hour prior to the deadline applicable to the other Banks. No offer submitted by a Bank may contain qualifying, conditional or similar language or contain proposed terms other than those specified in this paragraph (c). No later than 11:30 a.m. (New York time) on the Bid Rate Loan Date, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of the contents of all offers received by the Administrative Agent at or prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on such day from the Banks. 2
(d) Acceptance/Rejection of Offers. Not later than 12:00 noon (New York time) on the Bid Rate Loan Date, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (which notice shall be irrevocable except, with respect to notices that have not yet been relied upon by any Bank, in the case of manifest error) of the offers, if any, received from the Administrative Agent that the Borrower is accepting. Each offer that the Borrower has not notified the Administrative Agent by such time that it is accepting shall be deemed to have been rejected. The Borrower may, in its sole discretion, accept or reject any offer in whole or in part; provided that (i) the aggregate principal amount of offers accepted may not (after giving effect to the making of the Bid Loans to which such offers relate) cause the sum of (A) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans and (B) the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Participations to exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments at such time, (ii) the aggregate principal amount of offers accepted with respect to each requested Type of Bid Rate Loan may not exceed the principal amount specified for such Type in the request therefor, (iii) the aggregate principal amount of any offer by any Bank accepted with respect to a requested Type of Bid Rate Loan may not exceed the maximum, nor be less than the minimum, aggregate principal amount thereof specified in such Bank's offer with respect to such Type of Bid Rate Loan and (iv) subject to clauses (ii) and (iii) above, offers may be accepted only on the basis of ascending rates of interest. If offers with identical rates of interest are made by two or more Banks with respect to the same Type of requested Bid Rate Loans for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount accepted by the Borrower, the principal amount accepted shall be allocated by the Administrative Agent among such Banks as nearly as possible (but in such multiples as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of such offers. Such determination by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Upon receipt of any notice from the Borrower accepting any offer or offers, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each of the Banks that submitted offers in response to the applicable request whether its offers were accepted or rejected and, if any of such Bank's offers were accepted, shall identify such offers and the respective amounts thereof accepted. (e) Funding by the Banks. Not later than 3:00 p.m. (New York time) on the Bid Rate Loan Date, each Bank shall make the amount of the Bid Rate Loan or Bid Rate Loans to be made by such Bank available to the Administrative Agent, in Dollars in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office. (f) Disbursement to the Borrower. Bid Rate Loans shall be disbursed by the Administrative Agent not later than 3:30 p.m. (New York time) on the date specified therefor and shall be applied in the following order: first, to repay Bid Rate Loans maturing or matured as of such date that have not otherwise been repaid or for which provision for repayment has not been made; and second, by credit to an account of the Borrower at the Administrative Agent's Office or in such other manner as may have been specified to and as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, in each case in Dollars in funds immediately available to the Borrower or the appropriate Bank, as the case may be. Section 1.03 Letters of Credit. (a) Commitment to Issue. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Issuing Bank agrees to issue, from time to time during the period from the Agreement Date through the Termination Date, one or more Letters of Credit for the account of the Borrower, provided that (i) for each Bank, the sum of (A) the aggregate 3
unpaid principal amount of such Bank's RC Loans and (B) the aggregate amount of such Bank's Letter of Credit Participations shall not at any time exceed such Bank's Commitment at such time, (ii) the sum of (A) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans and (B) the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Participations shall not exceed at any time the aggregate amount of the Commitments at such time and (iii) the sum of the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Participations and 364-Day Letter of Credit Participations shall not exceed at any time the LC Sublimit at such time. (b) Terms of Letters of Credit. Each Letter of Credit shall (i) be in a form and shall contain such terms as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Issuing Bank, (ii) be denominated only in Dollars and shall expire on or before the date that is one year after the date of issuance thereof (provided, that any Letter of Credit may include terms that provide for the automatic renewal thereof for successive one-year periods so long as such terms include a provision whereby the Issuing Bank shall be entitled to elect that any such renewal shall not occur if the conditions set forth in Section 2.02(b) and (c) could not be fulfilled at such time, and the Issuing Bank shall give notice of such election to the beneficiary thereof) and in any event not later than the tenth Business Day preceding the Termination Date. Any extension of the expiry date, or automatic renewal, of a Letter of Credit to a date beyond the then existing expiry date thereof shall constitute an "issuance" of such Letter of Credit for all purposes hereof on, in the case of any such extension, the date on which such extension shall have been granted and, in the case of any such automatic renewal, on the tenth Business Day preceding the last day on which the Issuing Bank is entitled to give notice of its election that any such renewal shall not occur. (c) Manner of Request. In order to request a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at least five Business Days before the requested date of such issuance (which shall be a Business Day), (i) notice thereof in the form of Schedule 1.03 and (ii) a duly completed and executed copy of the Issuing Bank's then customary form of letter of credit application. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any such letter of credit application, the terms of this Agreement shall control. (d) Bank Participations. Upon the date of issuance of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have granted to each Participating Bank (other than the Issuing Bank), and each Participating Bank (other than the Issuing Bank) shall be deemed to have acquired from the Issuing Bank, without further action by any party hereto, a participation in such Letter of Credit and any Drawings that may at any time be made thereunder, to the extent of such Bank's Participating Bank Percentage thereof. (e) Existing Letter of Credit. The Existing Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be a Letter of Credit hereunder and, on the Agreement Date, the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have granted to each Participating Bank (other than the Issuing Bank), and each Participating Bank (other than the Issuing Bank) shall be deemed to have acquired from the Issuing Bank, without further action by any party hereto, a participation in the Existing Letter of Credit and any Drawings that may at any time be made thereunder, to the extent of such Bank's Participating Bank Percentage thereof. 4
(f) Notice of Drawings. The Issuing Bank shall, within one Business Day of receiving a Drawing request with respect to a Letter of Credit, notify the Borrower of its receipt thereof, stating the date and amount of the Drawing requested thereby and the date and amount of each Drawing disbursed pursuant to such request; provided that the failure of the Issuing Bank to give, or delay in giving, any such notice shall not release or diminish the obligations hereunder of the Borrower in respect of such Drawing. (g) Reimbursement of Drawings. The Borrower shall, on the Business Day following the day it receives notice of each Drawing, if such notice is received at or prior to 3:00 p.m. (New York time) on such day, and on the second Business Day following the day it receives such notice, if such notice is received after 3:00 p.m. (New York time) on such day, reimburse such Drawing by paying to the Issuing Bank in immediately available funds the amount of the payment made by the Issuing Bank with respect to such Drawing, together with, if such Drawing is not reimbursed on the date made, interest thereon, from (and including) the date of drawing to (but excluding) the date reimbursement is due (or, if earlier, the date reimbursement is made), at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate as in effect from time to time. (h) Funding of Participations. In the event that the Borrower shall fail to make any such payment when due and for so long as such failure shall be continuing, the Issuing Bank may give notice of such failure to the Administrative Agent and each Participating Bank, which notice shall include, in the case of a Participating Bank, the amount of such Participating Bank's Participating Bank Percentage of such Drawing. Each Participating Bank (other than the Issuing Bank) shall, in the event that it receives such notice from the Issuing Bank at or before 12:00 noon (New York time) on any Business Day, fund its participation in any unreimbursed Drawing by remitting to the Administrative Agent, no later than 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on such day, in immediately available funds, its Participating Bank Percentage of such Drawing, together with, if such funds are not remitted on the date of drawing, interest thereon, from (and including) the date of drawing to (but excluding) the date such funds are to be remitted to the Administrative Agent (or, if earlier, the date such funds are in fact so remitted), at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate as in effect from time to time. The Administrative Agent shall, in the event it receives such funds from such Participating Bank at or before 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on any day, no later than 4:00 p.m. (New York time) on such day, make available the amount thereof to the Issuing Bank, in immediately available funds. Any amount payable by any Participating Bank to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank under this Section 1.03(h), and any amount payable by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank under this Section 1.03(h), that is not paid when due shall bear interest, for each day from the date due (and including such day if paid after 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on such day, in the case of any such payment by a Participating Bank to the Administrative Agent, or 4:00 p.m. (New York time) on such day, in the case of any such payment by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank) in accordance with this Section 1.03(h) until the date it is received by the Issuing Bank, at a rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate until (and including) the third Business Day after the date due and thereafter at the Base Rate plus 2%. (i) Participating Banks' Entitlement to Payments. Upon payment of the principal of or interest on a Drawing (whether by payment by the Borrower, by exercise of any right of set-off, counterclaim or banker's lien, or otherwise), (i) if a Participating Bank has not been 5
required to fund its participation in such Drawing in accordance with Section 1.03(h), (A) such Participating Bank shall be entitled to its Participating Bank Percentage of any such payment of interest on such Drawing to the extent such payment (together with any prior payments of interest on such Drawing) exceeds interest calculated on the amount of such Drawing at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate as in effect from time to time for period from (and including) the date of drawing to (but excluding) the date such payment is made, but (B) such Participating Bank shall not be entitled to any portion of any payment of principal of such Drawing; and (ii) if the Participating Bank has been required to fund its participation of such Drawing in accordance with Section 1.03(h), such Participating Bank shall be entitled to its Participating Bank Percentage of any such payment of principal or interest. (j) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent and each Participating Bank for payments made with respect to any Letter of Credit, and the obligation of each Participating Bank to acquire Letter of Credit Participations and to make payments to the Issuing Bank with respect to Letters of Credit, shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable under any and all circumstances without reduction for any set-off or counterclaim of any nature whatsoever, may not be terminated, suspended or delayed for any reason whatsoever, shall not be subject to any qualification or exception, and shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement under all circumstances, including, without limitation, any of the following circumstances: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any other agreement; (ii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right which the Borrower or any of its Affiliates or any Bank may have at any time against a beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such transferee may be acting), the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, any Participating Bank or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated herein or therein or any unrelated transactions (including any underlying transaction between the Borrower or any of its Affiliates and the beneficiary for which any such Letter of Credit was procured); (iii) any draft, certificate or any other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; (iv) payment by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit against presentation of demand, draft or certificate or other document which does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; (v) the fact that a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; or (vi) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever. (k) Limitation of Liability. (i) The Borrower agrees that none of the Participating Banks, the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent or their respective officers or directors shall 6
be liable or responsible for, and the obligations of the Borrower to the Participating Banks, the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent hereunder shall not in any manner be affected by, (A) the use that may be made of any Letter of Credit or the proceeds thereof by the beneficiary thereof or any other Person or any acts or omissions of such beneficiary or any other Person; (B) the validity or genuineness of documents presented in connection with any Drawing, or of any endorsements thereon, even if such documents should, in fact, prove to be in any or all respects, invalid, fraudulent or forged; or (C) any other circumstances whatsoever in making or failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit or any other action taken or omitted to be taken by any Person under or in connection with any Letter of Credit; provided that the Borrower shall have a claim against the Issuing Bank, and the Issuing Bank shall be liable to the Borrower for, any damages suffered by the Borrower that are caused by (1) the Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or gross negligence (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction) in determining whether documents presented under any Letter of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank complied with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (2) the Issuing Bank's willful failure or gross negligence in failing (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction) to pay under such Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of documents strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Issuing Bank shall not be responsible for: (A) the validity, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with the issuance of Letters of Credit, (B) the validity of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof in whole or in part, (C) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmissions or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telecopy, telex or otherwise, (D) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit, or (E) any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank, including, without limitation, any governmental acts. (l) Indemnification and Reimbursement of Costs, Expenses and Claims. (i) In addition to any other amounts payable under this Agreement, the Borrower agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and hold the Issuing Bank harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) which the Issuing Bank may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of the issuance, amendment or administration of, or payment of any Drawing under, any Letter of Credit, other than as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. (ii) Each Participating Bank shall, upon the demand of the Issuing Bank, reimburse the Issuing Bank, to the extent the Issuing Bank has not been reimbursed by the 7
Borrower after demand therefor, for the reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) incurred by it (other than as a result of its willful misconduct or gross negligence) in connection with the collection of amounts due under, the administration of, and the preservation and enforcement of any rights conferred by, the Letters of Credit or the performance of the Issuing Bank's obligations under this Agreement in respect thereof (other than its obligation to make Loans in its capacity as a Bank), to the extent of such Participating Bank's Participating Bank Percentage (as of the time such costs and expenses are incurred) of the amount of such costs and expenses. The Issuing Bank shall refund any costs and expenses reimbursed by such Participating Bank that are subsequently recovered from the Borrower in an amount equal to such Participating Bank's Participating Bank Percentage thereof. (m) Assignment by Nonparticipating Banks. If any Bank Nonparticipation occurs with respect to any Bank, (i) the Administrative Agent agrees, if requested by the Borrower, to attempt to locate a bank or other financial institution that desires to accept the assignment of the Loans, Letter of Credit Participations, Commitments and other rights and obligations hereunder of such Bank and (ii) if such bank or other financial institution is located, such Bank agrees to assign its interest in its Loans, Letter of Credit Participations, Commitments and other rights and obligations hereunder to such bank or other financial institution in accordance with, and subject to the conditions set forth in, Section 8.08(a). Section 1.04 Interest. (a) Rates. (i) Except during an Event of Default, (A) each RC Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof until due at a rate per annum equal to, (1) so long as it is a Base Rate Loan, the Base Rate as in effect from time to time and (2) so long as it is a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the applicable Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Eurodollar Rate Margin and (B) each Bid Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof at the rate determined in accordance with Section 1.02(b). During an Event of Default, each Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof until due at the rate otherwise applicable under the preceding sentence plus 2%. (ii) If any amount payable under the Loan Documents (other than principal of a Loan) is not paid when due (whether at maturity, by reason of notice of prepayment or acceleration or otherwise), such unpaid amount shall, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overdue Rate. (b) Payment. Interest shall be payable, in the case of (i) RC Loans that are Base Rate Loans, on each Interest Payment Date, (ii) RC Loans that are Eurodollar Rate Loans, on the last day of each applicable Interest Period (and, if an Interest Period is longer than three months, at intervals of three months after the first day of such Interest Period), (iii) Bid Rate Loans, on the last day of the applicable Interest Period (and, if an Interest Period is longer than 90 days, at intervals of 90 days after the first day of such Interest Period) and (iv) any Loan, when such Loan shall be due (whether at maturity, by reason of notice of prepayment or acceleration or otherwise) or converted, but only to the extent then accrued on the amount then so due or converted. Interest at the Overdue Rate shall be payable on demand. (c) Conversion and Continuation of RC Loans. (i) All or any part of the principal amount of RC Loans of any Type may, on any Business Day, be converted into any other Type or Types of RC Loans, except that (A) Eurodollar Rate Loans may be converted only 8
on the last day of an applicable Interest Period and (B) Base Rate Loans may be converted into Eurodollar Rate Loans only on a Eurodollar Business Day. (ii) Base Rate Loans shall continue as Base Rate Loans unless and until such Loans are converted into RC Loans of another Type. Eurodollar Rate Loans of any Type shall continue as RC Loans of such Type until the end of the then current Interest Period therefor, at which time they shall be automatically converted into Base Rate Loans unless the Borrower shall have given the Administrative Agent notice in accordance with Section 1.04(c)(iv) requesting either that such Loans continue as RC Loans of such Type for another Interest Period or that such Loans be converted into RC Loans of another Type at the end of such Interest Period. (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 1.04(c)(i) or (ii), during a Default, the Administrative Agent may notify the Borrower that RC Loans may only be converted into or continued as RC Loans of certain specified Types and, thereafter, until no Default shall continue to exist, RC Loans may not be converted into or continued as Loans of any Type other than one or more of such specified Types. (iv) The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice (which shall be irrevocable) of each conversion of RC Loans or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans no later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the third Business Day before the requested date of such conversion or continuation. Each notice of conversion or continuation shall be in the form of Schedule 1.04 and shall specify (A) the requested date of such conversion or continuation, (B) the amount and Type and, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, the last day of the applicable Interest Period of the RC Loans to be converted or continued and (C) the amount and Type or Types of RC Loans into which such RC Loans are to be converted or as which such RC Loans are to be continued. Upon receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of (x) the contents thereof, (y) the amount and Type and, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, the last day of the applicable Interest Period of each RC Loan to be converted or continued by such Bank and (z) the amount and Type or Types of RC Loans into which such RC Loans are to be converted or as which such RC Loans are to be continued. (v) RC Loans may not be converted into Bid Rate Loans, and Bid Rate Loans may not be converted, except as required under Article VIII, or continued. (d) Maximum Interest Rate. Nothing contained in the Loan Documents shall require the Borrower at any time to pay interest at a rate exceeding the Maximum Permissible Rate. If interest payable by the Borrower on any date would exceed the maximum amount permitted by the Maximum Permissible Rate, such interest payment shall automatically be reduced to such maximum permitted amount, and interest for any subsequent period, to the extent less than the maximum amount permitted for such period by the Maximum Permissible Rate, shall be increased by the unpaid amount of such reduction. Any interest actually received for any period in excess of such maximum amount permitted for such period shall be deemed to have been applied as a prepayment of the Loans. Section 1.05 Repayment. (a) RC Loans. Each RC Loan shall mature and become due and payable, and shall be repaid by the Borrower, in full on the Termination Date. 9
(b) Bid Rate Loans. Each Bid Rate Loan shall mature and become due and payable, and shall be repaid by the Borrower in full, on the last day of the applicable Interest Period specified in accordance with Section 1.02(b). (c) Drawings. The Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing Bank for each Drawing under a Letter of Credit on the date determined with respect to such Drawing in the manner set forth in Section 1.03(g). Section 1.06 Prepayment of Loans. (a) RC Loans. The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, prepay the RC Loans in whole or in part, without premium or penalty (but subject to Section 1.15), except that any partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000 or any multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice of each prepayment no later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on, in the case of a prepayment of Base Rate Loans, the day of such prepayment (which shall be a Business Day) and, in the case of a prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans, the third Eurodollar Business Day before the date of such prepayment (which shall be a Eurodollar Business Day). Each such notice of prepayment shall be in the form of Schedule 1.06 and shall specify (i) the date such prepayment is to be made and (ii) the amount and Type and, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, the last day of the applicable Interest Period of the RC Loans to be prepaid. Upon receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and the amount and Type and, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, the last day of the applicable Interest Period of each RC Loan of such Bank to be prepaid. Amounts to be prepaid shall irrevocably be due and payable on the date specified in the applicable notice of prepayment, together with interest thereon as provided in Section 1.04(b). (b) Bid Rate Loans. Bid Rate Loans may not be optionally prepaid in whole or in part. Section 1.07 Limitation on Types of RC Loans. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Borrower shall borrow, prepay, convert and continue RC Loans in a manner such that (a) the aggregate principal amount of Eurodollar Rate Loans of the same Type and having the same Interest Period shall at all times be not less than $1,000,000, (b) there shall not be, at any one time, more than six Interest Periods in effect with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans of all Types and (c) no payment of Eurodollar Rate Loans will have to be made prior to the last day of an applicable Interest Period in order to repay the RC Loans on the date specified in Section 1.05. Section 1.08 Reduction of Commitments. The Borrower may reduce the Commitments by giving the Administrative Agent notice (which shall be irrevocable) thereof no later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the third Business Day before the requested date of such reduction, except that, (a) no partial reduction of the Commitments shall be in an aggregate amount other than $10,000,000 or any multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (b) no reduction may reduce the Commitments to an amount less than the sum of the aggregate principal amount of Loans outstanding and the amount of all Letter of Credit Participations outstanding at such time. Upon receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and the amount to which such Bank's Commitment is to be reduced. 10
Section 1.09 Increase in Commitments. At any time following the Agreement Date and prior to the Termination Date the aggregate amount of the Commitments may, at the option of the Borrower, be increased by an amount not in excess of $200,000,000, either by new Banks establishing such additional Commitments or by one or more then-existing Banks increasing their Commitments (each such increase by either means, a "Commitment Increase," and each such new Bank or Bank increasing its Commitment, an "Additional Commitment Bank"); provided that (a) each Additional Commitment Bank shall be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, (b) no Default shall exist immediately prior to or after the effective date of such Commitment Increase, (c) each such Commitment Increase shall be in an amount not less than $10,000,000 and multiples of $5,000,000 in excess thereof, (d) no such Commitment Increase shall become effective unless and until the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Additional Commitment Banks shall have executed and delivered an agreement substantially in the form of Schedule 1.09 (a "Commitment Increase Supplement"), and (d) the increase in the Total Commitments shall not exceed $200,000,000. On the effective date of such Commitment Increase, each Additional Commitment Bank shall purchase, for assignment, from each other existing Bank the portion of such other Bank's RC Loans and Letter of Credit Participations outstanding at such time such that, after giving effect to such assignments, the respective aggregate amount of RC Loans and Letter of Credit Participations of each Bank shall be equal to such Bank's pro rata share (based on the total Commitments, as increased pursuant hereto) of the aggregate RC Loans and Letter of Credit Participations outstanding. The purchase price for the RC Loans and Letter of Credit Participations so assigned shall be the principal amount of the RC Loans and unreimbursed Drawings so assigned plus the amount of accrued and unpaid interest thereon on the date of assignment. Upon payment of such purchase price, each other Bank shall be automatically deemed to have sold and made such an assignment to such Additional Commitment Bank and shall, to the extent of the interest assigned, be released from its obligations under this Agreement, and such Additional Commitment Bank shall be automatically deemed to have purchased and assumed such an assignment from each other Bank and, if not already a Bank hereunder, shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned, have the rights and obligations of a Bank under this Agreement. Section 1.10 Fees. (a) Facility Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank a facility fee, for each day from the Agreement Date through the Repayment Date, on the daily amount of the greater of (i) such Bank's Commitment on such day and (ii) the sum of (A) an aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Bank's RC Loans on such day and (B) the aggregate amount of such Bank's Letter of Credit Participations on such day, at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Facility Fee Rate for such day. The facility fee shall be payable on successive Interest Payment Dates, on the date of the termination or any reduction of the Commitments (to the extent accrued and unpaid on the amount of the reduction) and, at any time after the termination of the Commitments, on demand. (b) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank a letter of credit fee on the daily aggregate amount of such Bank's Participating Bank Percentage of the Contingent Reimbursement Obligations under all Letters of Credit with respect to which such Bank is a Participating Bank, at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Eurodollar Rate Margin from time to time in effect. Such fees shall be payable in arrears on successive Interest Payment Dates and on the date of expiration or termination of each 11
Letter of Credit (to the extent accrued and unpaid with respect to the Contingent Reimbursement Obligations under such Letter of Credit). (c) Fees Non-Refundable. None of the fees payable under this Section 1.10 shall be refundable in whole or in part. Section 1.11 Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and paid for the actual number of days elapsed. Interest calculated on any basis other than the Prime Rate and all fees payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed. Interest for any period shall be calculated from and including the first day thereof to but excluding the last day thereof. Section 1.12 Evidence of Indebtedness. Each Bank's Loans and the Borrower's obligation to repay such Loans with interest in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be evidenced by this Agreement, the records of such Bank and, in the case of RC Loans, a single RC Note payable to the order of such Bank and, in the case of Bid Rate Loans, a single Bid Rate Note payable to the order of such Bank. Each Bank's Letter of Credit Participations shall be evidenced by this Agreement, the records of such Bank and the Letters of Credit. The records of each Bank shall be prima facie evidence of such Bank's Loans and Letter of Credit Participations and, in each case, of accrued interest thereon and of all payments made in respect thereof. Section 1.13 Mandatory Suspension and Conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans. A Bank's obligations to make, continue or convert into Eurodollar Rate Loans of any Type shall be suspended, all such Bank's outstanding RC Loans of that Type shall be converted on the last day of their applicable Interest Periods (or, if earlier, in the case of clause (iii) below, on the last day such Bank may lawfully continue to maintain RC Loans of that Type or, in the case of clause (iv) below, on the day determined by such Bank to be the last Business Day before the effective date of the applicable restriction) into, and all pending requests for the making or continuation of or conversion into RC Loans of such Type by such Bank shall be deemed requests for, Base Rate Loans, if: (i) on or prior to the determination of an interest rate for a Eurodollar Rate Loan of that Type for any Interest Period, the Administrative Agent determines that for any reason appropriate information is not available to it for purposes of determining the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period; (ii) on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Rate Loan of that Type, the Required Banks determine that the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate as determined by the Administrative Agent for such Interest Period would not accurately reflect the cost to such Banks of making, continuing or converting into a Eurodollar Rate Loan of such Type for such Interest Period; (iii) at any time such Bank determines that any Regulatory Change Enacted after the Agreement Date makes it unlawful or impracticable for such Bank or its applicable Lending Office to make, continue or convert into any Eurodollar Rate Loan of that Type, or to comply with its obligations hereunder in respect thereof; or 12
(iv) such Bank determines that, by reason of any Regulatory Change Enacted after the Agreement Date, such Bank or its applicable Lending Office is restricted, directly or indirectly, in the amount that it may hold of (A) a category of liabilities that includes deposits by reference to which, or on the basis of which, the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Rate Loans of that Type is directly or indirectly determined or (B) the category of assets that includes Eurodollar Rate Loans of that Type. If, as a result of this Section 1.13, any RC Loan of any Bank that would otherwise be made or maintained as or converted into a Eurodollar Rate Loan of any Type for any Interest Period is instead made or maintained as or converted into a Base Rate Loan, then, unless the corresponding RC Loan of each of the other Banks is also to be made or maintained as or converted into a Base Rate Loan, such RC Loan shall be treated as being a Eurodollar Rate Loan of such Type for such Interest Period for all purposes of this Agreement (including the timing, application and proration among the Banks of interest payments, conversions and prepayments) except for the calculation of the interest rate borne by such RC Loan. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and each Bank of the existence or occurrence of any condition or circumstance specified in clause (a) (i) above, and each Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of the existence or occurrence of any condition or circumstance specified in clause (a) (ii), (iii) or (iv) above applicable to such Bank's RC Loans, but the failure by the Administrative Agent or such Bank to give any such notice shall not affect any Bank's rights hereunder. Section 1.14 Increased Costs; Reduced Return. If in the determination of any Bank or, in the case of any Letter of Credit or Drawing, the Issuing Bank, (a) any Regulatory Change Enacted after the Agreement Date shall directly or indirectly (i) reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by (A) such Bank with respect to any Loan or Letter of Credit Participation or the return to be earned by such Bank on any Loan or Letter of Credit Participation, or (B) the Issuing Bank with respect to any Letter of Credit or Drawing, (ii) impose a cost on (A) such Bank or any Affiliate of such Bank that is attributable to the making, funding or maintaining of, or such Bank's commitment to make or acquire, any Loan or Letter of Credit Participation, or (B) the Issuing Bank or any of its Affiliates that is attributable to the issuance or maintaining of, or the commitment to issue, any Letter of Credit or the making or maintaining of any Drawing, (iii) require (A) such Bank or any Affiliate of such Bank to make any payment on or calculated by reference to the gross amount of any amount received by such Bank under any Loan Document in respect of its Loans or its obligations to make Loans or (B) the Issuing Bank or any of its Affiliates to make any payment on or calculated by reference to the gross amount of any amount received by the Issuing Bank or any of its Affiliates in respect of any Letter of Credit or its commitment to issue any Letter of Credit or Drawing or (iv) reduce, or have the effect of reducing, the rate of return on any capital of (A) such Bank or any Affiliate of such Bank that such Bank or such Affiliate is required to maintain on account of any Loan or Letter of Credit Participation or such Bank's commitment to make or acquire any Loan or Letter of Credit Participation or (B) the Issuing Bank or any of its Affiliates that the Issuing Bank or such Affiliate is required to maintain on account of any Letter of Credit or Drawing or the Issuing Bank's commitment to issue any Letter of Credit and (b) such reduction, increased cost or payment shall not be fully compensated for by an adjustment in the applicable rates of interest payable under the Loan Documents, then the Borrower shall, upon request, pay to such Bank or 13
the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amounts as such Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, determines will, together with any adjustment in the applicable rates of interest payable hereunder, fully compensate for such reduction, increased cost or payment; provided that (x) neither any Bank nor the Issuing Bank may request compensation for any such reduction, increased cost or payment unless such Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, is generally requesting compensation for comparable reductions, increased costs or payments from similarly situated customers from which it is entitled to request compensation therefor and (y) the Borrower shall not be required to pay compensation to any Bank or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 1.14 for any period prior to the date that is 180 days before request for compensation is made by such Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be (except, in the event of a retroactive Regulatory Change, for the period that such Regulatory Change is made retroactively effective). Additional amounts payable by the Borrower under this Section 1.14 shall be payable, in the case of those applicable to prior periods, within 15 days after request by such Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such payment and, in the case of those applicable to future periods, on the dates specified, or determined in accordance with a method specified, by such Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be. Any request by a Bank or the Issuing Bank for the payment of additional amounts under this Section 1.14 as a result of an increased cost, reduced return or payment shall be accompanied by a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for the determination that such additional amounts are necessary to compensate such Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such increased cost, reduced return or payment. Section 1.15 Funding Losses. The Borrower shall pay to each Bank, upon request, such amount or amounts as such Bank determines are necessary to compensate it for any reasonable loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of (a) any assignment pursuant to Section 1.09 of a Eurodollar Rate Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) any payment, prepayment or conversion of a Eurodollar Rate Loan or payment or prepayment of a Bid Rate Loan on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan or Bid Rate Loan or (c) a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a Bid Rate Loan for any reason not being made or, in the case of a Eurodollar Rate Loans converted (other than as a result of the failure of such Bank to make such Loan available to the Borrower upon the fulfillment of the conditions specified in Article II without any determination by the Administrative Agent or such Bank under Section 1.13), or any payment of principal thereof or interest thereon not being made, on the date therefor determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement. At the election of such Bank, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but without duplication, such compensation on account of losses may include an amount equal to the excess of (i) the interest that would have been received from the Borrower under this Agreement on any amounts to be reemployed during an Interest Period or its remaining portion over (ii) the interest component of the return that such Bank determines it could have obtained had it placed such amount on deposit in the interbank Dollar market selected by it for a period equal to such Interest Period or its remaining portion. Any request for compensation under this Section 1.15 shall be accompanied by a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the loss, cost or expense for which compensation is claimed (including calculations setting forth in reasonable detail the computation of such loss, cost or expense). Section 1.16 Certain Determinations. In making the determinations contemplated by Sections 1.13, 1.14 and 1.15, each Bank and the Issuing Bank may make such estimates, 14
assumptions, allocations and the like that such Person in good faith determines to be appropriate, and such Person's selection thereof in accordance with this Section 1.16, and the determinations made by such Person on the basis thereof, shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Borrower, except, in the case of such determinations, for manifest errors in computation or transmission. Section 1.17 Payments by the Borrower. (a) Time, Place and Manner. All amounts payable for the account of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank under the Loan Documents shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office or at such other address as the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, respectively, may designate by notice to the Borrower. All amounts payable for the account of any Bank under the Loan Documents shall, in the case of payments on account of principal of or interest on the Loans or fees, be made to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office and, in the case of all other payments, be made directly to such Bank at its Domestic Lending Office or at such other address as such Bank may designate by notice to the Borrower. All amounts payable for the account of any Bank under the Loan Documents, whether made to the Administrative Agent or directly to such Bank, shall be made for the account of, in the case of payments in respect of Eurodollar Rate Loans, such Bank's Eurodollar Lending Office and, in the case of all other payments, such Bank's Domestic Lending Office. An amount shall not be deemed to have been paid by or on behalf of the Borrower on any day unless such amount has been received by the required Person, at the required place of payment, in Dollars in funds immediately available to such Person at such place, no later than 3:00 p.m. (New York time) on such day. (b) No Reductions. All payments due to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank under the Loan Documents shall be made, observed or performed by the Borrower without any reduction or deduction whatsoever, including any reduction or deduction for any set-off, recoupment, counterclaim (whether sounding in tort, contract or otherwise) or Tax, except, subject to Section 1.19, for any withholding or deduction for Taxes required to be withheld or deducted under Applicable Law. (c) Authorization to Charge Accounts. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Bank, if and to the extent any amount payable by the Borrower under the Loan Documents (whether payable to such Person or to any other Person that is the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or a Bank) is not otherwise paid when due, to charge such amount against any or all of the accounts of the Borrower with such Person or any of its Affiliates (whether maintained at a branch or office located within or without the United States), with the Borrower remaining liable for any deficiency. Any Bank charging an amount against an account of the Borrower shall provide notice thereof to the Borrower, within a reasonable time thereafter, which notice shall include a description in reasonable detail of such action. (d) Extension of Payment Dates. Whenever any payment to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank under the Loan Documents would otherwise be due on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment shall instead be due on the next succeeding Business Day. If the date any payment under the Loan Documents is due is extended (whether by operation of any Loan Document, Applicable Law or otherwise), such payment shall bear interest for such extended time at the rate of interest applicable hereunder. 15
Section 1.18 Distribution of Payments by the Administrative Agent. (a) The Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to the Issuing Bank and each Bank its share of each payment received by the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents for the account of the Issuing Bank and the Banks; provided that, if at the time of distribution, any Bank is in default of a payment obligation to the Issuing Bank hereunder, the Administrative Agent may remit to the Issuing Bank so much of any amount otherwise distributable to such Bank as shall be necessary to cure such default. Distributions by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank or a Bank shall be made by credit to an account of the Issuing Bank or such Bank at the Administrative Agent's Office or by wire transfer to an account of the Issuing Bank or such Bank at an office of any other commercial bank located in the United States. (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Issuing Bank or the Banks under the Loan Documents that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to the Issuing Bank and each Bank on such due date a corresponding amount with respect to the amount then due the Issuing Bank and such Bank. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall have so distributed to the Issuing Bank or any Bank a corresponding amount, the Issuing Bank or such Bank shall, on demand, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount so distributed together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to the Issuing Bank or such Bank until the date the Issuing Bank or such Bank repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate until (and including) the third Business Day after demand is made and thereafter at the Base Rate plus 2%. Section 1.19 Taxes. (a) (i) Taxes Payable by the Borrower. If under Applicable Law any Tax (other than Bank Taxes) is required to be withheld or deducted by the Borrower from, or is otherwise payable by the Borrower in connection with, any payment to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank under the Loan Documents, the Borrower (A) shall (1), if so required, withhold or deduct the amount of such Tax from such payment and, in any case, pay such Tax to the appropriate taxing authority in accordance with Applicable Law and (2) indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and such Bank in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.02(d) against its failure so to do and (B) shall, subject to Section 1.19(a)(iii), pay to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Bank, as applicable, such additional amounts as may be necessary so that the net amount received by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Bank with respect to such payment, after withholding or deducting all such Taxes required to be withheld or deducted by the Borrower, is equal to the full amount payable under the Loan Documents. If any such Tax is withheld or deducted by the Borrower from, or is otherwise payable by the Borrower in connection with, any payment payable to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank under the Loan Documents, the Borrower shall, as soon as possible after the date of such payment, furnish to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Bank, as applicable, the original or a certified copy of a receipt for such Tax from the applicable taxing authority. 16
(ii) Taxes Payable by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank. The Borrower shall, promptly upon request by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank for the payment thereof, but subject to Section 1.19(a)(iii), pay to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be, all Taxes (other than Bank Taxes) payable by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be, with respect to any payment due to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Bank under the Loan Documents. (iii) Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional amount in respect of withholding of United States Federal income taxes pursuant to this Section 1.19 to any Bank except (A) in the case of a Person that is a Bank on the Agreement Date, to the extent such Taxes are required to be withheld as a result of a Regulatory Change Enacted after the Agreement Date and (B) in the case of a Person that becomes a Bank after the Agreement Date, to the extent (1) such Taxes are required to be withheld as a result of a Regulatory Change Enacted after the date such Person becomes a Bank or (2) such additional amount would have been payable had such Person not become a Bank; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional amount in respect of withholding of United States Federal income taxes pursuant to this Section 1.19 to the extent such withholding is required because such Bank has failed to submit any form or certificate that it is entitled to so submit under Applicable Law. (iv) Exemption from US Withholding Taxes. There shall be submitted to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, (A) on or before the first date that interest or fees are payable to the Issuing Bank or such Bank under the Loan Documents, (1) if at the time the same are applicable, (aa) by each Bank that is not a United States Person and the Issuing Bank, if it is not a United States Person, two duly completed and signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or successor forms), in either case entitling the Issuing Bank or such Bank to a complete exemption from withholding of any United States federal income taxes on all amounts to be received by the Issuing Bank or such Bank under the Loan Documents, or (bb) by each Bank that is a Non-US Bank and the Issuing Bank if it is a Non-US Bank, (x) a duly completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or successor form) and (y) a certification in the form of Schedule 1.19(a)(iv) that the Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be, is a Non-US Bank or (2) if at the time any of the foregoing are inapplicable, duly completed and signed copies of such form, if any, as entitles the Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be, to exemption from withholding of United States federal income taxes to the maximum extent to which the Issuing Bank or such Bank is then entitled under Applicable Law, and (B) from time to time thereafter, prior to the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered form or upon any previously delivered form becoming inaccurate or inapplicable, such further duly completed and signed copies of such form, if any, as entitles the Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be, to exemption from withholding of United States Federal income taxes to the maximum extent to which such Person is then entitled under Applicable Law. The Issuing Bank and each Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent if (A) it is required to withdraw or cancel any form or certificate previously submitted by it or any such form or certificate has otherwise become ineffective or inaccurate or (B) payments to it are or will be subject to withholding of United States Federal income taxes to a greater extent than the extent to which payments to it were previously subject. Upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, each Bank that is a 17
United States Person and the Issuing Bank if it is a United States Person shall from time to time submit to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a certificate to the effect that it is such a United States Person and a duly completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or successor form). (b) Credits and Deductions. If the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank obtains any credit, deduction or other reduction in Bank Taxes with respect to any payment made by the Borrower under Section 1.19(a)(i), the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be, shall pay to the Borrower such amount, not exceeding the increased amount paid by the Borrower, as is equal to the net after-tax value to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Bank, in its sole opinion, of such part of such credit, deduction or other reduction as it considers to be allocable to such payment by the Borrower, having regard to all of the Administrative Agent's, the Issuing Bank's or such Bank's dealings giving rise to similar credits, deductions or other reductions in relation to the same tax period and to the cost of obtaining the same; provided, however, that (i) the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be, shall not be obligated to disclose to the Borrower any information regarding its tax affairs or computations and (ii) nothing in this Section 1.19(b) shall interfere with the right of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Bank to arrange its tax affairs as it deems appropriate. Section 1.20 Change of Lending Office. If an event occurs with respect to a Lending Office of any Bank or, in the case of any Letter of Credit or Drawing, the Issuing Bank, that obligates the Borrower to pay any amount under Section 1.19(a), makes operable the provisions of clause (a)(iii) or (iv), or (b), of Section 1.13 or entitles such Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to make a claim under Section 1.19(a) or 1.14, such Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts to designate another Lending Office or Offices the designation of which will reduce the amount the Borrower is so obligated to pay, eliminate such operability or reduce the amount such Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, is so entitled to claim, provided that such designation would not, in the sole and absolute discretion of such Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, be disadvantageous to such Bank or the Issuing Bank in any manner or contrary to such Bank's or the Issuing Bank's, as the case may be, policies. Each Bank and the Issuing Bank may at any time and from time to time change any Lending Office and shall give notice of any such change to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. Except in the case of a change in Lending Offices made at the request of the Borrower, the designation of a new Lending Office by any Bank or the Issuing Bank shall not obligate the Borrower to pay any amount to such Bank under Section 1.19(a), make operable the provisions of clause (a)(iii) or (a)(iv) or (b) of Section 1.13 or entitle such Bank or the Issuing Bank to make a claim under Section 1.19(a) or 1.14 if such obligation, the operability of such clause or such claim results solely from such designation and not from a Regulatory Change Enacted thereafter. Section 1.21 Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, (a) RC Loans of each Type to be made on any day shall be made by the Banks pro rata in accordance with their respective Commitments, (b) RC Loans of the Banks shall be converted and continued pro rata in accordance with their respective amounts of RC Loans of the Type and, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, having the Interest Period being so converted or continued, (c) each reduction in the Commitments shall be made pro rata in accordance with the respective amounts thereof and (d) each payment of the principal of or interest on the RC Loans, 18
reimbursement of Drawings under Letters of Credit or of facility and letter of credit fees shall be made for the account of the Banks pro rata in accordance with the respective amounts thereof then due to the Banks. Section 1.22 Sharing of Recoveries. Each Bank agrees that, if, for any reason, including as a result of (a) the exercise of any right of counterclaim, set-off, banker's lien or similar right, (b) its claim in any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law being deemed secured by a Debt owed by it to the Borrower, including a claim deemed secured under Section 506 of the Bankruptcy Code, or (c) the allocation of payments by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower in a manner contrary to the provisions of Section 1.21, such Bank shall receive payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount due and payable to it hereunder as principal of or interest on the Loans or Letter of Credit Participations or fees that is greater than the proportion received by any other Bank in respect of the aggregate of such amounts due and payable to such other Bank hereunder, then the Bank receiving such proportionately greater payment shall purchase participations (which it shall be deemed to have done simultaneously upon the receipt of such payment) in the rights of the other Banks hereunder so that all such recoveries with respect to such amounts due and payable hereunder (net of costs of collection) shall be pro rata; provided, however, that no such participation shall be deemed to have been so purchased in any Bid Rate Loans of any of the other Banks; provided, further, that if all or part of such proportionately greater payment received by the purchasing Bank is thereafter recovered by or on behalf of the Borrower from such Bank, such purchases shall be rescinded and the purchase prices paid for such participations shall be returned to such Bank to the extent of such recovery, but without interest (unless the purchasing Bank is required to pay interest on the amount recovered to the Person recovering such amount, in which case the selling Bank shall be required to pay interest at a like rate). The Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements and agrees that any holder of a participation in any rights hereunder so purchased or acquired pursuant to this Section 1.22 shall, with respect to such participation, be entitled to all of the rights of a Bank under Sections 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.19, 1.20, 8.02, and 8.07 (subject to any condition imposed on a Bank hereunder with respect thereto, including delivery of the forms and certificates required under Section 1.19(a)(iv)) and may exercise any and all rights of set-off with respect to such participation as fully as though the Borrower were directly indebted to the holder of such participation for Loans in the amount of such participation. Section 1.23 Bank Obligations Several. The obligations of the Banks under this Agreement are several and not joint. Any Bank's failure to make any Loan to be made by it on the requested date therefor shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation to make any Loan to be made by such other Bank on such date, but such other Bank shall not be liable for such failure. Any Participating Bank's failure to fund its participation in a Drawing shall not relieve any other Participating Bank of its obligation to fund its participation in such Drawing, but such other Participating Bank shall not be liable for such failure. Section 1.24 Disbursement to Borrower by Administrative Agent Prior to Receipt of Funds. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on the requested date for the making of any Loans that such Bank will not make available to the Administrative Agent the Loans to be made by such Bank on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such Loans available to the Administrative Agent on such date in accordance with Section 1.01(c) or 1.02(e), as the case 19
may be, and the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount on behalf of such Bank. If and to the extent such Bank shall not have so made available to the Administrative Agent the Loans to be made by such Bank on such date and the Administrative Agent shall have so made available to the Borrower a corresponding amount on behalf of such Bank, such Bank shall, on demand, pay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount shall have been so made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower until the date such amount shall have been repaid to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate until (and including) the third Business Day after demand is made and thereafter at the Base Rate plus 2%. If such Bank does not pay such corresponding amount promptly upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Borrower shall immediately repay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent together with accrued interest thereon at the applicable rate or rates provided in Section 1.04(a). ARTICLE II CONDITIONS TO LOANS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT Section 2.01 Conditions to Initial Loans and Letters of Credit. The obligation of each Bank to make its initial Loan (whether such initial Loans are RC Loans or Bid Rate Loans) or the Issuing Bank to issue the initial Letter of Credit hereunder, whichever shall first occur, is subject to the determination of each Bank and the Issuing Bank, each in its sole and absolute discretion, that each of the following conditions has been fulfilled: (a) The Administrative Agent shall have received on the Agreement Date each of the following, in form and substance and, in the case of the materials referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (vi) and (vii), certified in a manner satisfactory to the Administrative Agent: (i) a certificate of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Borrower, dated the Agreement Date, substantially in the form of Schedule 2.01(a)(i), to which shall be attached copies of the resolutions and by-laws referred to in such certificate; (ii) a certificate of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Borrower dated the Agreement Date certifying the names and true signatures of the officers of the Borrower authorized to sign this Agreement and the other documents to be delivered hereunder; (iii) a copy of the certificate of incorporation of the Borrower and each Significant Subsidiary, certified, as of a recent date, by the Secretary of State or other appropriate official of the Borrower's or such Significant Subsidiary's jurisdiction of incorporation; (iv) a good standing certificate with respect to the Borrower and each Significant Subsidiary, issued as of a recent date by the Secretary of State or other appropriate official of the Borrower's or such Significant Subsidiary's jurisdiction of 20

Section 2.02 Conditions to Each Loan and Letter of Credit. The obligation of each Bank to make each Loan requested to be made by it, including its initial Loan, and the obligation of the Issuing Bank to issue each Letter of Credit requested to be issued by it (including any request to extend the expiry date of any Letter of Credit to a date beyond the then current expiry date thereof or any automatic renewal thereof as provided in Section 1.03(b)), is subject to the determination of the Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be, each in its sole and absolute discretion, that each of the following conditions has been fulfilled: (a) the Administrative Agent shall have received (i) in the case of an RC Loan, a notice of borrowing with respect to such Loan in accordance with the requirements of Section 1.01, (ii) in the case of a Bid Rate Loan, notice of acceptance of an offer by such Bank to make such Loan in accordance with the requirements of Section 1.02, or (iii) in the case of a Letter of Credit, a notice of a request for issuance with respect to such Letter of Credit in accordance with the requirements of Section 1.03; (b) each Representation and Warranty shall be true and correct at and as of the time such Loan is to be made or Letter of Credit issued, both with and without giving effect to such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit and all other Loans and Letters of Credit to be made or issued at such time and to the application of the proceeds thereof; (c) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time such Loan is to be made or such Letter of Credit is to be issued or would result from the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit and all other Loans and Letters of Credit to be made or issued at such time or from the application of the proceeds thereof; (d) in the case of any such Loan, such Loan will not contravene any Applicable Law applicable to such Bank, including Regulation U; and (e) in the case of any such Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall have received such other instruments and agreements related thereto as the Issuing Bank shall have reasonably requested.

ARTICLE III REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES In order to induce the Administrative Agent, each Bank and the Issuing Bank to enter into this Agreement and to make each Loan requested to be made by it or to issue each Letter of Credit, the Borrower represents and warrants as follows: Section 3.01 Organization; Power; Qualification. The Borrower and each Significant Subsidiary are corporations duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of their respective jurisdictions of incorporation, have the corporate power and authority to own their respective properties and to carry on their respective businesses as now being and hereafter proposed to be conducted and are duly qualified and in good standing as foreign corporations, and are authorized to do business, in all jurisdictions in which the character of their respective properties or the nature of their respective businesses requires such qualification or authorization, except for qualifications or authorizations the lack of which, singly or in the aggregate, has not and will not have a Materially Adverse Effect on the Borrower and the Consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Section 3.02 Subsidiaries. Schedule 3.02 sets forth, as of the Agreement Date, all of the Subsidiaries, their jurisdictions of incorporation, the percentages of the various classes of their Capital Securities owned by the Borrower or another Subsidiary, which Subsidiaries are Consolidated Subsidiaries and which Subsidiaries are Significant Subsidiaries. The Borrower or another Subsidiary, as the case may be, has the unrestricted right to vote, and (subject to limitations imposed by Applicable Law) to receive dividends and distributions on, all Capital Securities of the Significant Subsidiaries indicated on Schedule 3.02 as owned by the Borrower or such Subsidiary. All such Capital Securities have been duly authorized and issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. Section 3.03 Authorization; Enforceability; Required Consents; Absence of Conflicts. The Borrower has the power, and has taken all necessary action (including, if a corporation, any necessary stockholder action) to authorize it, to execute, deliver and perform in accordance with their respective terms the Loan Documents and to borrow Loans and have Letters of Credit issued in the maximum amount available hereunder. This Agreement has been, and each of the other Loan Documents when delivered to the Administrative Agent will have been, duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and is, or when so delivered will be, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally. The execution, delivery and performance in accordance with their respective terms by the Borrower of the Loan Documents, and each borrowing of Loans and issuance of Letters of Credit, whether or not in the maximum amount then available hereunder, do not and (absent any change in any Applicable Law or applicable Contract) will not (a) require any Governmental Approval or any other consent or approval, including any consent or approval of the stockholders of the Borrower, to have been obtained or any Governmental Registration to have been made, by the Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary, other than Governmental Approvals and other consents and approvals and Governmental Registrations that have been obtained or made, as the 23
case may be, are final and not subject to review on appeal or to collateral attack, are in full force and effect and, in the case of any such required under any Applicable Law or Contract as in effect on the Agreement Date, are listed on Schedule 3.03, or (b) violate, conflict with, result in a breach of, constitute a default under, or result in or require the creation of any Lien upon any assets of the Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary under, (i) any Contract to which the Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary is a party or by which the Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary or any of their respective properties may be bound or (ii) any Applicable Law. Section 3.04 Taxes. The Borrower and each Subsidiary have (a) filed all Tax returns required to have been filed by it under Applicable Law and paid all Taxes that are due and payable by it or have been assessed against it, except to the extent the failure to file such Tax returns or pay such Taxes, singly or in the aggregate, has not and will not have a Materially Adverse Effect on the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole and (b) to the extent required by generally accepted accounting principles, reserved against all Taxes in excess of $1,000,000 that are payable by it but are not yet due or that are due and payable by it or have been assessed against it but have not yet been paid. Section 3.05 Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.05, there are not, in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any governmental or non-governmental body, any actions, suits or proceedings pending or threatened (nor, to the knowledge of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, is there any basis therefor) against or in any other way relating to or affecting (a) such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses or properties or (b) any Loan Document, except actions, suits or proceedings that (x) could not, singly or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected (taking into account the likelihood of an adverse determination) to have a Materially Adverse Effect on the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole and (y) if adversely determined, would not, singly or in the aggregate, have a Materially Adverse Effect on any Loan Document. Section 3.06 Financial Statements. The financial statements set forth on Schedule 3.06 fairly present, in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, (i) in the case of the financial statements of New Century Energies, Inc., the consolidated financial position of New Century Energies, Inc. and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as at their respective dates and the consolidated results of operations, retained earnings and, as applicable, changes in financial position or cash flows of New Century Energies, Inc. and such Subsidiaries for the respective periods to which such statements relate, (ii) in the case of the financial statements of Northern States Power Company, the consolidated financial position of Northern States Power Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as at their respective dates and the consolidated results of operations, retained earnings and, as applicable, changes in financial position or cash flows of Northern States Power Company and such Subsidiaries for the respective periods to which such statements relate, and (iii) in the case of the pro-forma financial statements of the Borrower, the consolidated pro-forma financial position of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries (after giving effect to the merger of Northern States Power Company and New Century Energies, Inc) as at their respective dates and the consolidated results of operations, retained earnings and, as applicable, changes in financial position or cash flows of the Borrower and such Subsidiaries for the respective periods to which such statements relate. Except as disclosed or reflected in the December 31, 1999 balance sheet referred to in clause (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence, as at December 31, 1999 neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary had any Liability, 24
contingent or otherwise, or any unrealized or anticipated loss, that, singly or in the aggregate, has had or might have a Materially Adverse Effect on the Borrower and the Consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Section 3.07 No Adverse Change or Event. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.07, since December 31, 1999, no change in the business, assets, Liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of the Borrower or any Subsidiary has occurred, and no event has occurred or failed to occur, that has had or might have, either alone or in conjunction with all other such changes, events and failures, a Materially Adverse Effect on (a) the Borrower and the Consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (b) any Loan Document. Such an adverse change may have occurred, and such event may have occurred or failed to occur, at any particular time notwithstanding the fact that at such time no Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Section 3.08 Investment Company Act; Public Utility Holding Company Act. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is an "investment company" or a Person "controlled" by an "investment company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

The Borrower and each Subsidiary is in compliance with all Applicable Law and the terms of all Contracts to which such Person is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound, except for non-compliances that, either singly or in the aggregate, would not have a Materially Adverse Effect on (a) the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (b) any Loan Document. Section 3.10 Substance Release and Disposal. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10, there have been no releases or disposals of hazardous wastes, environmental contaminants or other substances in quantities or locations that, singly or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in the incurrence by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of remedial obligations under Applicable Law that could reasonably be expected to have a Materially Adverse Effect on the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice or order advising it that it has or may have any remedial obligation with respect to any such releases or disposals or that it is or may be responsible for the costs of any remedial action taken or to be taken by any other Persons with respect to any such releases or disposals, which obligation or cost, if fully payable could reasonably be expected to, singly or in the aggregate, have a Materially Adverse Effect on the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Section 3.11 Accuracy of Information. The Information furnished to the Administrative Agent or the Banks by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary on or prior to the Agreement Date (other than the financial statements referred to in Section 3.06) does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made. 25

The Loans and other obligations of the Borrower to the Banks and Issuing Banks under the Loan Documents will at all times rank at least pari passu in priority of payment with all of the Borrower's other unsecured indebtedness.

Each Bank hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes The Bank of New York, and The Bank of New York hereby agrees, to act as the agent for such Bank under the Loan Documents with such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms thereof, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent's duties shall be purely ministerial and it shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent shall not be required under any circumstances to take any action that, in its judgment, (a) is contrary to any provision of the Loan Documents or Applicable Law or (b) would expose it to any Liability or expense against which it has not been indemnified to its satisfaction. The Administrative Agent shall not, by reason of its serving as the Administrative Agent, be a trustee or other fiduciary for any Bank. Section 7.02 Limitation on Administrative Agent's Liability. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable or responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with the Loan Documents, except for its or their own gross negligence, willful misconduct or knowing violations of law. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to any Bank for (a) any recitals, statements, representations or warranties contained in the Loan Documents or in any certificate or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by any of the Banks under, the Loan Documents, (b) the validity, effectiveness or enforceability of the Loan Documents or any such certificate or other document or (c) any failure by the Borrower to perform any of its obligations under the Loan Documents.

The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any certification, notice or other communication (including any thereof by telephone, telex, telecopier, telegram or cable) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or given by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. As to any matters not expressly provided for by the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under the Loan Documents in accordance with instructions signed by the Required Banks, and such instructions of the Required Banks and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Banks. Section 7.03 Defaults. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of the occurrence of a Default (other than the non-payment to it of principal of or interest on Loans or fees) unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Bank or the Borrower specifying such Default and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default". In the event that the Administrative Agent has knowledge of such a non-payment or receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Banks. In the event of any Default, the Administrative Agent shall (a) in the case of a Default that constitutes an Event of Default, take any of the actions referred to in clauses (a), (b) 34
and (c) of the first sentence of Section 6.02 if so directed by the Required Banks and (b) in the case of any Default, take such other action with respect to such Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Banks. Unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, in the event of any Default, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Banks. Section 7.04 Rights as a Bank. Each Person acting as the Administrative Agent that is also a Bank shall, in its capacity as a Bank, have the same rights and powers under the Loan Documents as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not acting as the Administrative Agent, and the term "Bank" or "Banks" shall include such Person in its individual capacity. Each Person acting as the Administrative Agent (whether or not such Person is a Bank) and its Affiliates may (without having to account therefor to any Bank) accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with the Borrower and its Affiliates as if it were not acting as the Administrative Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower and its Affiliates for services in connection with the Loan Documents or otherwise without having to account for the same to the Banks.

The Banks agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower hereunder), ratably on the basis of the respective principal amounts of the Loans outstanding made by the Banks (or, if no Loans are at the time outstanding, ratably on the basis of their respective Commitments), for any and all Liabilities, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (including the costs and expenses that the Borrower is obligated to pay hereunder) in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any other documents contemplated thereby or referred to therein or the transactions contemplated thereby or the enforcement of any of the terms thereof or of any such other documents, provided that no Bank shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from gross negligence, willful misconduct or knowing violations of law by the Administrative Agent. Section 7.06 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Banks. Each Bank agrees that it has made and will continue to make, independently and without reliance on the Administrative Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it deems appropriate, its own credit analysis of the Borrower and its own decision to enter into the Loan Documents and to take or refrain from taking any action in connection therewith. The Administrative Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by the Borrower of the Loan Documents or any other document referred to or provided for therein or to inspect the properties or books of the Borrower or any Subsidiary. Except for notices, reports and other documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to provide any Bank with any information concerning the business, status or condition of the Borrower or any Subsidiary or the Loan Documents that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates. 35
Section 7.07 Resignation of the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Banks and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Banks may, after consultation with the Borrower, appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Banks and after consultation with the Borrower, appoint a successor Administrative Agent. Upon the acceptance by any Person of its appointment as a successor Administrative Agent, such Person shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges, duties and obligations of the retiring Administrative Agent and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents.

Section 8.08 Assignments and Participations. (a) Any Bank may assign to one or more Persons (other than a natural Person) all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment, Letter of Credit Participations and Loans); provided that (i) each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and, unless such assignment is to an Affiliate of such Bank or an Event of Default pursuant to Section 6.01(f) hereof has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower shall consent to such assignment (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii) except in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Bank's Commitment, Letter of Credit Participations and the RC Loans at the time owing to it, the amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Letter of Credit Participations and RC Loans outstanding thereunder) of the assigning Bank subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and, so long as no Event of Default pursuant to Section 6.01(f) hereof has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consent (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (iii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the RC Loans, Letter of Credit Participations and Commitment assigned, and (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 8.08, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Bank under this Agreement, and the assigning Bank thereunder shall, 40
to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of a Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto). Any assignment or transfer by a Bank of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Bank of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section 8.08. (b) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in New York City a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks, and the Commitments of, amount of Letter of Credit Participations held by, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Bank pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Banks may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Bank hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Bank, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (c) Any Bank may, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Bank's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment, Letter of Credit Participations and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Banks shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Bank sells such a participation shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Bank will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in Section 8.06(a) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (d) of this Section 8.08, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 1.14, 1.15 and 1.19 to the same extent as if it were a Bank and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 8.08. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 8.07 as though it were a Bank, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 1.22 as though it were a Bank. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 1.15 or 1.19 than the applicable Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Non-US Bank if it were a Bank shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 1.19 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 1.19(a)(iv) as though it were a Bank. 41
(d) Any Bank may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Bank, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Bank from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Bank as a party hereto. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Bank (a "Granting Bank") may grant to one special purpose funding vehicle (an "SPC") sponsored by such Granting Bank, as identified as such in writing from time to time to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Bank would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to the terms hereof; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment to make any Loan by any SPC and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Bank shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of such Granting Bank to the same extent as if such Loan were made by such Granting Bank. Any SPC that makes a Loan shall (i) have in regard to such Loan all of the rights (exercisable, however, only through its Granting Bank as its agent) that such Granting Bank would have had if it had made such Loan directly and (ii) comply with this Agreement in regard to such Loan on the same terms as any other party hereto; provided that (A) the Granting Bank's Commitment shall remain with such Granting Bank and (B) all monetary obligations of an SPC hereunder in respect of the Loans it provides shall remain with its Granting Bank to the extent at any time that such SPC elects not to or otherwise fails to perform or pay any such obligation. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any payment under this Agreement for which a Bank would otherwise be liable so long as, and to the extent, its sponsoring Granting Bank makes such payment. Notwithstanding any Loans that may be provided by an SPC hereunder, the Administrative Agent and Borrower shall be entitled to continue to communicate and deal solely and directly with the Granting Bank in connection with this Agreement in respect of such Loans. Each SPC that is identified by its Granting Bank as having been granted an option hereunder shall be deemed to have confirmed (and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may require a written acknowledgment of such confirmation signed by any such SPC) to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that (a) it has received a copy of each Loan Document, together with copies of the financial statements heretofore provided to Banks under the terms of this Agreement and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement; (b) agrees that it will independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, its Granting Bank or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under any Loan Document; (c) appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under any Loan Document as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms thereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto; (d) agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of any Loan Document are required to be performed by it as a Bank, subject to the terms of this Section; and (e) appoints its Granting Bank, or a specified branch or affiliate thereof, as its agent and attorney in fact, and grants to its Granting Bank an irrevocable power of attorney, to receive payments made for the benefit such SPC under this Agreement, to deliver and receive all communications and notices under the Loan Documents 42
and to exercise on such SPC's behalf all rights to vote and to grant and make approvals, waivers, consents or amendments to or under the Loan Documents. Any document executed by an SPC's Granting Bank on such SPC's behalf in connection with the Loan Documents shall be binding on such SPC. The Borrower, all the Banks and the Administrative Agent each hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or similar proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 8.08(a), any SPC may, with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and without the payment of any processing and recordation fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to its Granting Bank. Any SPC may disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of liquidity and/or credit facilities to such SPC. Nothing in this Section that would affect the rights or obligations of an SPC may be amended without the written consent of any SPC that has Loans outstanding at the time of such amendment. Section 8.09 Governing Law. The rights and duties of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agents, the Issuing Bank and the Banks under this Agreement and the Notes (including matters relating to the Maximum Permissible Rate), and the other Loan Documents shall, pursuant to New York General Obligations Law Section 5-1401, be governed by the law of the State of New York. Section 8.10 Judicial Proceedings; Waiver of Jury Trial. Any judicial proceeding brought against the Borrower with respect to any Loan Document Related Claim may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction in the City of New York, and, by execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Borrower (a) accepts, generally and unconditionally, the nonexclusive jurisdiction of such courts and any related appellate court and irrevocably agrees to be bound by any judgment rendered thereby in connection with any Loan Document Related Claim and (b) irrevocably waives any objection it may now or hereafter have as to the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court or that such a court is an inconvenient forum. The Borrower hereby waives personal service of process and consents that service of process upon it may be made by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, at its address specified or determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.01(b), and service so made shall be deemed completed on the third Business Day after such service is deposited in the mail. Nothing herein shall affect the right of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, any Bank or any other Indemnified Person to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the right of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, any Bank or any other Indemnified Person to bring proceedings against the Borrower in the courts of any other jurisdiction. Any judicial proceeding by the Borrower against the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank involving any Loan Document Related Claim shall be brought only in a court located in the City and State of New York.

Section 8.12 Severability of Provisions. Any provision of the Loan Documents that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions thereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

EXECUTION COPY 364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT Dated as of November 10, 2000 XCEL ENERGY INC., a Minnesota corporation, the BANKS listed on the signature pages hereof, BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. and CITICORP USA, INC., as Syndication Agents, and THE BANK OF NEW YORK, as Issuing Bank and Administrative Agent, agree as follows (with certain terms used herein being defined in Article 10): ARTICLE I CREDIT FACILITY Section 1.01 RC Loans. (a) Commitment to Lend. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each Bank agrees to make, from time to time during the period from the Agreement Date through the Termination Date, RC Loans to the Borrower, provided that (i) the sum of (A) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Bank's RC Loans and (B) the aggregate amount of such Bank's Letter of Credit Participations shall not at any time exceed such Bank's Commitment at such time and (ii) the sum of (A) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Participations shall not exceed at any time the aggregate amount of the Commitments at such time. Subject to Section 1.07 and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, the RC Loans may, at the option of the Borrower, be made as, and from time to time continued as or converted into, Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate Loans of any permitted Type, or any combination thereof. (b) Manner of Request. In order to request RC Loans, the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice (which shall be irrevocable) no later than 10:00 a.m. (New York time) on, in the case of Base Rate Loans, the requested date for the making of such RC Loans, and, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, the third Eurodollar Business Day before the requested date for the making of such RC Loans. Each such notice shall be in the form of Schedule 1.01 and shall specify (A) the requested date for the making of the requested RC Loans, which shall be, in the case of Base Rate Loans, a Business Day and, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, a Eurodollar Business Day, (B) the Type or Types of RC Loans requested and (C) the amount of each such Type of RC Loan, the aggregate of which amounts for all Types of RC Loans requested shall be $2,000,000 or any multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof, or, if less, the aggregate amount of the unused Commitments. Upon receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of the amount and Type of each RC Loan to be made by such Bank on the requested date specified therein. (c) Funding by the Banks. Not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on each requested date for the making of RC Loans, each Bank shall, if it has received the notice contemplated by Section 1.01(b) on or prior to 12:00 noon (New York time) on such date, in the case of Base Rate Loans, or on or prior to its close of business on the third Eurodollar Business Day before such date, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, make available to the Administrative Agent, in Dollars in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office, the RC Loans to be made by such Bank on such date.
(d) Disbursement to the Borrower. All RC Loans made available to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 1.01(c) shall be disbursed by the Administrative Agent not later than 3:00 p.m. (New York time) on the requested date therefor in Dollars in funds immediately available to the Borrower by credit to an account of the Borrower at the Administrative Agent's Office or in such other manner as may have been specified in the applicable notice and as shall be acceptable to the Administrative Agent. Section 1.02 Bid Rate Loans. (a) Right to Request. The Borrower may request the Banks to make, from time to time during the period from the Agreement Date through the Termination Date, Bid Rate Loans to the Borrower; provided that the sum of (i) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Participations shall not exceed at any time the aggregate amount of the Commitments at such time. (b) Manner of Request. In order to request Bid Rate Loans, the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent a request for Bid Rate Loans no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York time) on the Business Day prior to the Bid Rate Loan Date. Each such request shall be submitted substantially in the form of Schedule 1.02(b) and shall specify (i) the Bid Rate Loan Date, which shall be a Business Day, (ii) the aggregate principal amount of each Type of requested Bid Rate Loans and (iii) the duration of the Interest Periods (each of which shall end on a Business Day (x) no earlier than 7 days and no later than 180 days after the Bid Rate Loan Date and (y) no later than the Termination Date) for each Type of requested Bid Rate Loans. Upon receipt of a timely request for Bid Rate Loans on a Business Day, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Bank of the contents thereof no later than 2:30 p.m. (New York time) on such Business Day. (c) Submission of Offers by the Banks. Each Bank may, in its sole and absolute discretion, submit one or more offers to make each Type of requested Bid Rate Loan in response to a request for Bid Rate Loans. Offers shall be irrevocable (but Loans to be made pursuant thereto shall be subject to Article 2), except with the written consent of the Administrative Agent given on the written instructions of the Borrower, and may not be modified except to correct a manifest error. Offers shall (i) be submitted substantially in the form of Schedule 1.02(c), (ii) identify the Bank making such offer, (iii) identify the request for Bid Rate Loans to which such offer relates, (iv) specify the Types of Bid Rate Loans such Bank is making an offer for, (v) for each such Type of Bid Rate Loans, specify (A) the principal amount, or the maximum and minimum principal amounts, of the Bid Rate Loan such Bank is willing make (which amounts, singly or in the aggregate, may exceed such Bank's Commitment at such time) and (B) the rate of interest per annum on the Bid Rate Loan that such Bank is willing to accept, and (vi) be submitted by telecopier to the Administrative Agent no later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the Bid Rate Loan Date, except that offers for requested Bid Rate Loans submitted by a Bank that is the Administrative Agent or any Affiliate thereof shall be submitted not later than one half hour prior to the deadline applicable to the other Banks. No offer submitted by a Bank may contain qualifying, conditional or similar language or contain proposed terms other than those specified in this paragraph (c). No later than 11:30 a.m. (New York time) on the Bid Rate Loan Date, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of the contents of all offers received by the Administrative Agent at or prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on such day from the Banks. 2
(d) Acceptance/Rejection of Offers. Not later than 12:00 noon (New York time) on the Bid Rate Loan Date, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (which notice shall be irrevocable except, with respect to notices that have not yet been relied upon by any Bank, in the case of manifest error) of the offers, if any, received from the Administrative Agent that the Borrower is accepting. Each offer that the Borrower has not notified the Administrative Agent by such time that it is accepting shall be deemed to have been rejected. The Borrower may, in its sole discretion, accept or reject any offer in whole or in part; provided that (i) the aggregate principal amount of offers accepted may not (after giving effect to the making of the Bid Loans to which such offers relate) cause the sum of (A) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans and (B) the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Participations to exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments at such time, (ii) the aggregate principal amount of offers accepted with respect to each requested Type of Bid Rate Loan may not exceed the principal amount specified for such Type in the request therefor, (iii) the aggregate principal amount of any offer by any Bank accepted with respect to a requested Type of Bid Rate Loan may not exceed the maximum, nor be less than the minimum, aggregate principal amount thereof specified in such Bank's offer with respect to such Type of Bid Rate Loan and (iv) subject to clauses (ii) and (iii) above, offers may be accepted only on the basis of ascending rates of interest. If offers with identical rates of interest are made by two or more Banks with respect to the same Type of requested Bid Rate Loans for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount accepted by the Borrower, the principal amount accepted shall be allocated by the Administrative Agent among such Banks as nearly as possible (but in such multiples as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of such offers. Such determination by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Upon receipt of any notice from the Borrower accepting any offer or offers, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each of the Banks that submitted offers in response to the applicable request whether its offers were accepted or rejected and, if any of such Bank's offers were accepted, shall identify such offers and the respective amounts thereof accepted. (e) Funding by the Banks. Not later than 3:00 p.m. (New York time) on the Bid Rate Loan Date, each Bank shall make the amount of the Bid Rate Loan or Bid Rate Loans to be made by such Bank available to the Administrative Agent, in Dollars in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office. (f) Disbursement to the Borrower. Bid Rate Loans shall be disbursed by the Administrative Agent not later than 3:30 p.m. (New York time) on the date specified therefor and shall be applied in the following order: first, to repay Bid Rate Loans maturing or matured as of such date that have not otherwise been repaid or for which provision for repayment has not been made; and second, by credit to an account of the Borrower at the Administrative Agent's Office or in such other manner as may have been specified to and as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, in each case in Dollars in funds immediately available to the Borrower or the appropriate Bank, as the case may be. Section 1.03 Letters of Credit. (a) Commitment to Issue. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Issuing Bank agrees to issue, from time to time during the period from the Agreement Date through the Termination Date, one or more Letters of Credit for the account of the Borrower, provided that (i) for each Bank, the sum of (A) the aggregate 3
unpaid principal amount of such Bank's RC Loans and (B) the aggregate amount of such Bank's Letter of Credit Participations shall not at any time exceed such Bank's Commitment at such time, (ii) the sum of (A) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans and (B) the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Participations shall not exceed at any time the aggregate amount of the Commitments at such time and (iii) the sum of the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Participations and Five-Year Letter of Credit Participations shall not exceed at any time the LC Sublimit at such time. (b) Terms of Letters of Credit. Each Letter of Credit shall (i) be in a form and shall contain such terms as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Issuing Bank, (ii) be denominated only in Dollars and shall expire not later than the tenth Business Day preceding the Termination Date. Any extension of the expiry date, or automatic renewal, of a Letter of Credit to a date beyond the then existing expiry date thereof shall constitute an "issuance" of such Letter of Credit for all purposes hereof on, in the case of any such extension, the date on which such extension shall have been granted and, in the case of any such automatic renewal, on the tenth Business Day preceding the last day on which the Issuing Bank is entitled to give notice of its election that any such renewal shall not occur. (c) Manner of Request. In order to request a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at least five Business Days before the requested date of such issuance (which shall be a Business Day), (i) notice thereof in the form of Schedule 1.03 and (ii) a duly completed and executed copy of the Issuing Bank's then customary form of letter of credit application. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any such letter of credit application, the terms of this Agreement shall control. (d) Bank Participations. Upon the date of issuance of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have granted to each Participating Bank (other than the Issuing Bank), and each Participating Bank (other than the Issuing Bank) shall be deemed to have acquired from the Issuing Bank, without further action by any party hereto, a participation in such Letter of Credit and any Drawings that may at any time be made thereunder, to the extent of such Bank's Participating Bank Percentage thereof. (e) Notice of Drawings. The Issuing Bank shall, within one Business Day of receiving a Drawing request with respect to a Letter of Credit, notify the Borrower of its receipt thereof, stating the date and amount of the Drawing requested thereby and the date and amount of each Drawing disbursed pursuant to such request; provided that the failure of the Issuing Bank to give, or delay in giving, any such notice shall not release or diminish the obligations hereunder of the Borrower in respect of such Drawing. (f) Reimbursement of Drawings. The Borrower shall, on the Business Day following the day it receives notice of each Drawing, if such notice is received at or prior to 3:00 p.m. (New York time) on such day, and on the second Business Day following the day it receives such notice, if such notice is received after 3:00 p.m. (New York time) on such day, reimburse such Drawing by paying to the Issuing Bank in immediately available funds the amount of the payment made by the Issuing Bank with respect to such Drawing, together with, if such Drawing is not reimbursed on the date made, interest thereon, from (and including) the date of drawing to (but excluding) the date reimbursement is due (or, if earlier, the date 4
reimbursement is made), at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate as in effect from time to time. (g) Funding of Participations. In the event that the Borrower shall fail to make any such payment when due and for so long as such failure shall be continuing, the Issuing Bank may give notice of such failure to the Administrative Agent and each Participating Bank, which notice shall include, in the case of a Participating Bank, the amount of such Participating Bank's Participating Bank Percentage of such Drawing. Each Participating Bank (other than the Issuing Bank) shall, in the event that it receives such notice from the Issuing Bank at or before 12:00 noon (New York time) on any Business Day, fund its participation in any unreimbursed Drawing by remitting to the Administrative Agent, no later than 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on such day, in immediately available funds, its Participating Bank Percentage of such Drawing, together with, if such funds are not remitted on the date of drawing, interest thereon, from (and including) the date of drawing to (but excluding) the date such funds are to be remitted to the Administrative Agent (or, if earlier, the date such funds are in fact so remitted), at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate as in effect from time to time. The Administrative Agent shall, in the event it receives such funds from such Participating Bank at or before 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on any day, no later than 4:00 p.m. (New York time) on such day, make available the amount thereof to the Issuing Bank, in immediately available funds. Any amount payable by any Participating Bank to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank under this Section 1.03(g), and any amount payable by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank under this Section 1.03(g), that is not paid when due shall bear interest, for each day from the date due (and including such day if paid after 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on such day, in the case of any such payment by a Participating Bank to the Administrative Agent, or 4:00 p.m. (New York time) on such day, in the case of any such payment by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank) in accordance with this Section 1.03(g) until the date it is received by the Issuing Bank, at a rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate until (and including) the third Business Day after the date due and thereafter at the Base Rate plus 2%. (h) Participating Banks' Entitlement to Payments. Upon payment of the principal of or interest on a Drawing (whether by payment by the Borrower, by exercise of any right of set-off, counterclaim or banker's lien, or otherwise), (i) if a Participating Bank has not been required to fund its participation in such Drawing in accordance with Section 1.03(g), (A) such Participating Bank shall be entitled to its Participating Bank Percentage of any such payment of interest on such Drawing to the extent such payment (together with any prior payments of interest on such Drawing) exceeds interest calculated on the amount of such Drawing at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate as in effect from time to time for period from (and including) the date of drawing to (but excluding) the date such payment is made, but (B) such Participating Bank shall not be entitled to any portion of any payment of principal of such Drawing; and (ii) if the Participating Bank has been required to fund its participation of such Drawing in accordance with Section 1.03(g), such Participating Bank shall be entitled to its Participating Bank Percentage of any such payment of principal or interest. (i) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent and each Participating Bank for payments made with respect to any Letter of Credit, and the obligation of each Participating Bank to acquire Letter of Credit Participations and to make payments to the Issuing Bank with respect to Letters of Credit, 5
shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable under any and all circumstances without reduction for any set-off or counterclaim of any nature whatsoever, may not be terminated, suspended or delayed for any reason whatsoever, shall not be subject to any qualification or exception, and shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement under all circumstances, including, without limitation, any of the following circumstances: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any other agreement; (ii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right which the Borrower or any of its Affiliates or any Bank may have at any time against a beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such transferee may be acting), the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, any Participating Bank or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated herein or therein or any unrelated transactions (including any underlying transaction between the Borrower or any of its Affiliates and the beneficiary for which any such Letter of Credit was procured); (iii) any draft, certificate or any other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; (iv) payment by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit against presentation of demand, draft or certificate or other document which does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; (v) the fact that a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; or (vi) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever. (j) Limitation of Liability. (i) The Borrower agrees that none of the Participating Banks, the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent or their respective officers or directors shall be liable or responsible for, and the obligations of the Borrower to the Participating Banks, the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent hereunder shall not in any manner be affected by, (A) the use that may be made of any Letter of Credit or the proceeds thereof by the beneficiary thereof or any other Person or any acts or omissions of such beneficiary or any other Person; (B) the validity or genuineness of documents presented in connection with any Drawing, or of any endorsements thereon, even if such documents should, in fact, prove to be in any or all respects, invalid, fraudulent or forged; or (C) any other circumstances whatsoever in making or failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit or any other action taken or omitted to be taken by any Person under or in connection with any Letter of Credit; provided that the Borrower shall have a claim against the Issuing Bank, and the Issuing Bank shall be liable to the Borrower for, any damages suffered by the Borrower that are caused by (1) the Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or gross negligence (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction) in determining whether documents presented under any Letter of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank complied with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (2) the Issuing Bank's willful failure or gross negligence in 6
failing (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction) to pay under such Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of documents strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Issuing Bank shall not be responsible for: (A) the validity, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with the issuance of Letters of Credit, (B) the validity of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof in whole or in part, (C) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmissions or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telecopy, telex or otherwise, (D) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit, or (E) any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank, including, without limitation, any governmental acts. (k) Indemnification and Reimbursement of Costs, Expenses and Claims. (i) In addition to any other amounts payable under this Agreement, the Borrower agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and hold the Issuing Bank harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) which the Issuing Bank may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of the issuance, amendment or administration of, or payment of any Drawing under, any Letter of Credit, other than as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. (ii) Each Participating Bank shall, upon the demand of the Issuing Bank, reimburse the Issuing Bank, to the extent the Issuing Bank has not been reimbursed by the Borrower after demand therefor, for the reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) incurred by it (other than as a result of its willful misconduct or gross negligence) in connection with the collection of amounts due under, the administration of, and the preservation and enforcement of any rights conferred by, the Letters of Credit or the performance of the Issuing Bank's obligations under this Agreement in respect thereof (other than its obligation to make Loans in its capacity as a Bank), to the extent of such Participating Bank's Participating Bank Percentage (as of the time such costs and expenses are incurred) of the amount of such costs and expenses. The Issuing Bank shall refund any costs and expenses reimbursed by such Participating Bank that are subsequently recovered from the Borrower in an amount equal to such Participating Bank's Participating Bank Percentage thereof. (l) Assignment by Nonparticipating Banks. If any Bank Nonparticipation occurs with respect to any Bank, (i) the Administrative Agent agrees, if requested by the Borrower, to attempt to locate a bank or other financial institution that desires to accept the assignment of the 7
Loans, Letter of Credit Participations, Commitments and other rights and obligations hereunder of such Bank and (ii) if such bank or other financial institution is located, such Bank agrees to assign its interest in its Loans, Letter of Credit Participations, Commitments and other rights and obligations hereunder to such bank or other financial institution in accordance with, and subject to the conditions set forth in, Section 8.08(a). Section 1.04 Interest. (a) Rates. (i) Except during an Event of Default, (A) each RC Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof until due at a rate per annum equal to, (1) so long as it is a Base Rate Loan, the Base Rate as in effect from time to time and (2) so long as it is a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the applicable Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Eurodollar Rate Margin and (B) each Bid Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof at the rate determined in accordance with Section 1.02(b). During an Event of Default, each Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof until due at the rate otherwise applicable under the preceding sentence plus 2%. (ii) If any amount payable under the Loan Documents (other than principal of a Loan) is not paid when due (whether at maturity, by reason of notice of prepayment or acceleration or otherwise), such unpaid amount shall, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overdue Rate. (b) Payment. Interest shall be payable, in the case of (i) RC Loans that are Base Rate Loans, on each Interest Payment Date, (ii) RC Loans that are Eurodollar Rate Loans, on the last day of each applicable Interest Period (and, if an Interest Period is longer than three months, at intervals of three months after the first day of such Interest Period), (iii) Bid Rate Loans, on the last day of the applicable Interest Period (and, if an Interest Period is longer than 90 days, at intervals of 90 days after the first day of such Interest Period) and (iv) any Loan, when such Loan shall be due (whether at maturity, by reason of notice of prepayment or acceleration or otherwise) or converted, but only to the extent then accrued on the amount then so due or converted. Interest at the Overdue Rate shall be payable on demand. (c) Conversion and Continuation of RC Loans. (i) All or any part of the principal amount of RC Loans of any Type may, on any Business Day, be converted into any other Type or Types of RC Loans, except that (A) Eurodollar Rate Loans may be converted only on the last day of an applicable Interest Period and (B) Base Rate Loans may be converted into Eurodollar Rate Loans only on a Eurodollar Business Day. (ii) Base Rate Loans shall continue as Base Rate Loans unless and until such Loans are converted into RC Loans of another Type. Eurodollar Rate Loans of any Type shall continue as RC Loans of such Type until the end of the then current Interest Period therefor, at which time they shall be automatically converted into Base Rate Loans unless the Borrower shall have given the Administrative Agent notice in accordance with Section 1.04(c)(iv) requesting either that such Loans continue as RC Loans of such Type for another Interest Period or that such Loans be converted into RC Loans of another Type at the end of such Interest Period. (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 1.04(c)(i) or (ii), during a Default, the Administrative Agent may notify the Borrower that RC Loans may only be converted into or continued as RC Loans of certain specified Types and, thereafter, until no 8
Default shall continue to exist, RC Loans may not be converted into or continued as Loans of any Type other than one or more of such specified Types. (iv) The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice (which shall be irrevocable) of each conversion of RC Loans or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans no later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the third Business Day before the requested date of such conversion or continuation. Each notice of conversion or continuation shall be in the form of Schedule 1.04 and shall specify (A) the requested date of such conversion or continuation, (B) the amount and Type and, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, the last day of the applicable Interest Period of the RC Loans to be converted or continued and (C) the amount and Type or Types of RC Loans into which such RC Loans are to be converted or as which such RC Loans are to be continued. Upon receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of (x) the contents thereof, (y) the amount and Type and, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, the last day of the applicable Interest Period of each RC Loan to be converted or continued by such Bank and (z) the amount and Type or Types of RC Loans into which such RC Loans are to be converted or as which such RC Loans are to be continued. (v) RC Loans may not be converted into Bid Rate Loans, and Bid Rate Loans may not be converted, except as required under Article VIII, or continued. (d) Maximum Interest Rate. Nothing contained in the Loan Documents shall require the Borrower at any time to pay interest at a rate exceeding the Maximum Permissible Rate. If interest payable by the Borrower on any date would exceed the maximum amount permitted by the Maximum Permissible Rate, such interest payment shall automatically be reduced to such maximum permitted amount, and interest for any subsequent period, to the extent less than the maximum amount permitted for such period by the Maximum Permissible Rate, shall be increased by the unpaid amount of such reduction. Any interest actually received for any period in excess of such maximum amount permitted for such period shall be deemed to have been applied as a prepayment of the Loans. Section 1.05 Repayment. (a) RC Loans. Subject to Section 1.25(c), each RC Loan shall mature and become due and payable, and shall be repaid by the Borrower, in full on the Termination Date. (b) Bid Rate Loans. Subject to Section 1.25(c), each Bid Rate Loan shall mature and become due and payable, and shall be repaid by the Borrower in full, on the last day of the applicable Interest Period specified in accordance with Section 1.02(b). (c) Drawings. The Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing Bank for each Drawing under a Letter of Credit on the date determined with respect to such Drawing in the manner set forth in Section 1.03(f). Section 1.06 Prepayment of Loans. (a) RC Loans. The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, prepay the RC Loans in whole or in part, without premium or penalty (but subject to Section 1.15), except that any partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000 or any multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice of each prepayment no later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) 9
on, in the case of a prepayment of Base Rate Loans, the day of such prepayment (which shall be a Business Day) and, in the case of a prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans, the third Eurodollar Business Day before the date of such prepayment (which shall be a Eurodollar Business Day). Each such notice of prepayment shall be in the form of Schedule 1.06 and shall specify (i) the date such prepayment is to be made and (ii) the amount and Type and, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, the last day of the applicable Interest Period of the RC Loans to be prepaid. Upon receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and the amount and Type and, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, the last day of the applicable Interest Period of each RC Loan of such Bank to be prepaid. Amounts to be prepaid shall irrevocably be due and payable on the date specified in the applicable notice of prepayment, together with interest thereon as provided in Section 1.04(b). (b) Bid Rate Loans. Bid Rate Loans may not be optionally prepaid in whole or in part. Section 1.07 Limitation on Types of RC Loans. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Borrower shall borrow, prepay, convert and continue RC Loans in a manner such that (a) the aggregate principal amount of Eurodollar Rate Loans of the same Type and having the same Interest Period shall at all times be not less than $1,000,000, (b) there shall not be, at any one time, more than six Interest Periods in effect with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans of all Types and (c) no payment of Eurodollar Rate Loans will have to be made prior to the last day of an applicable Interest Period in order to repay the RC Loans on the date specified in Section 1.05. Section 1.08 Reduction of Commitments. The Borrower may reduce the Commitments by giving the Administrative Agent notice (which shall be irrevocable) thereof no later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the third Business Day before the requested date of such reduction, except that, (a) no partial reduction of the Commitments shall be in an aggregate amount other than $10,000,000 or any multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (b) no reduction may reduce the Commitments to an amount less than the sum of the aggregate principal amount of Loans outstanding and the amount of all Letter of Credit Participations outstanding at such time. Upon receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and the amount to which such Bank's Commitment is to be reduced. Section 1.09 Increase in Commitments. At any time following the Agreement Date and prior to the Termination Date the aggregate amount of the Commitments may, at the option of the Borrower, be increased by an amount not in excess of $200,000,000, either by new Banks establishing such additional Commitments or by one or more then-existing Banks increasing their Commitments (each such increase by either means, a "Commitment Increase," and each such new Bank or Bank increasing its Commitment, an "Additional Commitment Bank"); provided that (a) each Additional Commitment Bank shall be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, (b) no Default shall exist immediately prior to or after the effective date of such Commitment Increase, (c) each such Commitment Increase shall be in an amount not less than $10,000,000 and multiples of $5,000,000 in excess thereof, (d) no such Commitment Increase shall become effective unless and until the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Additional Commitment Banks shall have 10
executed and delivered an agreement substantially in the form of Schedule 1.09 (a "Commitment Increase Supplement"), and (d) the increase in the Total Commitments shall not exceed $200,000,000. On the effective date of such Commitment Increase, each Additional Commitment Bank shall purchase, for assignment, from each other existing Bank the portion of such other Bank's RC Loans and Letter of Credit Participations outstanding at such time such that, after giving effect to such assignments, the respective aggregate amount of RC Loans and Letter of Credit Participations of each Bank shall be equal to such Bank's pro rata share (based on the total Commitments, as increased pursuant hereto) of the aggregate RC Loans and Letter of Credit Participations outstanding. The purchase price for the RC Loans and Letter of Credit Participations so assigned shall be the principal amount of the RC Loans and unreimbursed Drawings so assigned plus the amount of accrued and unpaid interest thereon on the date of assignment. Upon payment of such purchase price, each other Bank shall be automatically deemed to have sold and made such an assignment to such Additional Commitment Bank and shall, to the extent of the interest assigned, be released from its obligations under this Agreement, and such Additional Commitment Bank shall be automatically deemed to have purchased and assumed such an assignment from each other Bank and, if not already a Bank hereunder, shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned, have the rights and obligations of a Bank under this Agreement. Section 1.10 Fees. (a) Facility Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank a facility fee, for each day from the Agreement Date through the Repayment Date, on the daily amount of the greater of (i) such Bank's Commitment on such day and (ii) the sum of (A) an aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Bank's RC Loans on such day and (B) the aggregate amount of such Bank's Letter of Credit Participations on such day, at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Facility Fee Rate for such day. The facility fee shall be payable on successive Interest Payment Dates, on the date of the termination or any reduction of the Commitments (to the extent accrued and unpaid on the amount of the reduction) and, at any time after the termination of the Commitments, on demand. (b) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank a letter of credit fee on the daily aggregate amount of such Bank's Participating Bank Percentage of the Contingent Reimbursement Obligations under all Letters of Credit with respect to which such Bank is a Participating Bank, at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Eurodollar Rate Margin from time to time in effect. Such fees shall be payable in arrears on successive Interest Payment Dates and on the date of expiration or termination of each Letter of Credit (to the extent accrued and unpaid with respect to the Contingent Reimbursement Obligations under such Letter of Credit). (c) Fees Non-Refundable. None of the fees payable under this Section 1.10 shall be refundable in whole or in part. Section 1.11 Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and paid for the actual number of days elapsed. Interest calculated on any basis other than the Prime Rate and all fees payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed. Interest for any period shall be calculated from and including the first day thereof to but excluding the last day thereof. 11
Section 1.12 Evidence of Indebtedness. Each Bank's Loans and the Borrower's obligation to repay such Loans with interest in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be evidenced by this Agreement, the records of such Bank and, in the case of RC Loans, a single RC Note payable to the order of such Bank and, in the case of Bid Rate Loans, a single Bid Rate Note payable to the order of such Bank. Each Bank's Letter of Credit Participations shall be evidenced by this Agreement, the records of such Bank and the Letters of Credit. The records of each Bank shall be prima facie evidence of such Bank's Loans and Letter of Credit Participations and, in each case, of accrued interest thereon and of all payments made in respect thereof. Section 1.13 Mandatory Suspension and Conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans. A Bank's obligations to make, continue or convert into Eurodollar Rate Loans of any Type shall be suspended, all such Bank's outstanding RC Loans of that Type shall be converted on the last day of their applicable Interest Periods (or, if earlier, in the case of clause (iii) below, on the last day such Bank may lawfully continue to maintain RC Loans of that Type or, in the case of clause (iv) below, on the day determined by such Bank to be the last Business Day before the effective date of the applicable restriction) into, and all pending requests for the making or continuation of or conversion into RC Loans of such Type by such Bank shall be deemed requests for, Base Rate Loans, if: (i) on or prior to the determination of an interest rate for a Eurodollar Rate Loan of that Type for any Interest Period, the Administrative Agent determines that for any reason appropriate information is not available to it for purposes of determining the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period; (ii) on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Rate Loan of that Type, the Required Banks determine that the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate as determined by the Administrative Agent for such Interest Period would not accurately reflect the cost to such Banks of making, continuing or converting into a Eurodollar Rate Loan of such Type for such Interest Period; (iii) at any time such Bank determines that any Regulatory Change Enacted after the Agreement Date makes it unlawful or impracticable for such Bank or its applicable Lending Office to make, continue or convert into any Eurodollar Rate Loan of that Type, or to comply with its obligations hereunder in respect thereof; or (iv) such Bank determines that, by reason of any Regulatory Change Enacted after the Agreement Date, such Bank or its applicable Lending Office is restricted, directly or indirectly, in the amount that it may hold of (A) a category of liabilities that includes deposits by reference to which, or on the basis of which, the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Rate Loans of that Type is directly or indirectly determined or (B) the category of assets that includes Eurodollar Rate Loans of that Type. If, as a result of this Section 1.13, any RC Loan of any Bank that would otherwise be made or maintained as or converted into a Eurodollar Rate Loan of any Type for any Interest Period is instead made or maintained as or converted into a Base Rate Loan, then, unless the corresponding RC Loan of each of the other Banks is also to be made or maintained as or 12
converted into a Base Rate Loan, such RC Loan shall be treated as being a Eurodollar Rate Loan of such Type for such Interest Period for all purposes of this Agreement (including the timing, application and proration among the Banks of interest payments, conversions and prepayments) except for the calculation of the interest rate borne by such RC Loan. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and each Bank of the existence or occurrence of any condition or circumstance specified in clause (a) (i) above, and each Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of the existence or occurrence of any condition or circumstance specified in clause (a) (ii), (iii) or (iv) above applicable to such Bank's RC Loans, but the failure by the Administrative Agent or such Bank to give any such notice shall not affect any Bank's rights hereunder. Section 1.14 Increased Costs; Reduced Return. If in the determination of any Bank or, in the case of any Letter of Credit or Drawing, the Issuing Bank, (a) any Regulatory Change Enacted after the Agreement Date shall directly or indirectly (i) reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by (A) such Bank with respect to any Loan or Letter of Credit Participation or the return to be earned by such Bank on any Loan or Letter of Credit Participation, or (B) the Issuing Bank with respect to any Letter of Credit or Drawing, (ii) impose a cost on (A) such Bank or any Affiliate of such Bank that is attributable to the making, funding or maintaining of, or such Bank's commitment to make or acquire, any Loan or Letter of Credit Participation, or (B) the Issuing Bank or any of its Affiliates that is attributable to the issuance or maintaining of, or the commitment to issue, any Letter of Credit or the making or maintaining of any Drawing, (iii) require (A) such Bank or any Affiliate of such Bank to make any payment on or calculated by reference to the gross amount of any amount received by such Bank under any Loan Document in respect of its Loans or its obligations to make Loans or (B) the Issuing Bank or any of its Affiliates to make any payment on or calculated by reference to the gross amount of any amount received by the Issuing Bank or any of its Affiliates in respect of any Letter of Credit or its commitment to issue any Letter of Credit or Drawing or (iv) reduce, or have the effect of reducing, the rate of return on any capital of (A) such Bank or any Affiliate of such Bank that such Bank or such Affiliate is required to maintain on account of any Loan or Letter of Credit Participation or such Bank's commitment to make or acquire any Loan or Letter of Credit Participation or (B) the Issuing Bank or any of its Affiliates that the Issuing Bank or such Affiliate is required to maintain on account of any Letter of Credit or Drawing or the Issuing Bank's commitment to issue any Letter of Credit and (b) such reduction, increased cost or payment shall not be fully compensated for by an adjustment in the applicable rates of interest payable under the Loan Documents, then the Borrower shall, up request, pay to such Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amounts as such Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, determines will, together with any adjustment in the applicable rates of interest payable hereunder, fully compensate for such reduction, increased cost or payment; provided that (x) neither any Bank nor the Issuing Bank may request compensation for any such reduction, increased cost or payment unless such Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, is generally requesting compensation for comparable reductions, increased costs or payments from similarly situated customers from which it is entitled to request compensation therefor and (y) the Borrower shall not be required to pay compensation to any Bank or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 1.14 for any period prior to the date that is 180 days before request for compensation is made by such Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be (except, in the event of a retroactive Regulatory Change, for the period that such Regulatory Change is made retroactively effective). Additional amounts payable by the Borrower under this Section 1.14 shall be 13
payable, in the case of those applicable to prior periods, within 15 days after request by such Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such payment and, in the case of those applicable to future periods, on the dates specified, or determined in accordance with a method specified, by such Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be. Any request by a Bank or the Issuing Bank for the payment of additional amounts under this Section 1.14 as a result of an increased cost, reduced return or payment shall be accompanied by a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for the determination that such additional amounts are necessary to compensate such Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such increased cost, reduced return or payment. Section 1.15 Funding Losses. The Borrower shall pay to each Bank, upon request, such amount or amounts as such Bank determines are necessary to compensate it for any reasonable loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of (a) any assignment pursuant to Section 1.09 of a Eurodollar Rate Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) any payment, prepayment or conversion of a Eurodollar Rate Loan or payment or prepayment of a Bid Rate Loan on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan or Bid Rate Loan or (c) a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a Bid Rate Loan for any reason not being made or, in the case of a Eurodollar Rate Loans converted (other than as a result of the failure of such Bank to make such Loan available to the Borrower upon the fulfillment of the conditions specified in Article II without any determination by the Administrative Agent or such Bank under Section 1.13), or any payment of principal thereof or interest thereon not being made, on the date therefor determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement. At the election of such Bank, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but without duplication, such compensation on account of losses may include an amount equal to the excess of (i) the interest that would have been received from the Borrower under this Agreement on any amounts to be reemployed during an Interest Period or its remaining portion over (ii) the interest component of the return that such Bank determines it could have obtained had it placed such amount on deposit in the interbank Dollar market selected by it for a period equal to such Interest Period or its remaining portion. Any request for compensation under this Section 1.15 shall be accompanied by a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the loss, cost or expense for which compensation is claimed (including calculations setting forth in reasonable detail the computation of such loss, cost or expense). Section 1.16 Certain Determinations. In making the determinations contemplated by Sections 1.13, 1.14 and 1.15, each Bank and the Issuing Bank may make such estimates, assumptions, allocations and the like that such Person in good faith determines to be appropriate, and such Person's selection thereof in accordance with this Section 1.16, and the determinations made by such Person on the basis thereof, shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Borrower, except, in the case of such determinations, for manifest errors in computation or transmission. Section 1.17 Payments by the Borrower. (a) Time, Place and Manner. All amounts payable for the account of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank under the Loan Documents shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office or at such other address as the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, respectively, may designate by notice to the Borrower. All amounts payable for the account of any Bank under the Loan Documents shall, in the case of payments on account of principal of or interest on the Loans or 14
fees, be made to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office and, in the case of all other payments, be made directly to such Bank at its Domestic Lending Office or at such other address as such Bank may designate by notice to the Borrower. All amounts payable for the account of any Bank under the Loan Documents, whether made to the Administrative Agent or directly to such Bank, shall be made for the account of, in the case of payments in respect of Eurodollar Rate Loans, such Bank's Eurodollar Lending Office and, in the case of all other payments, such Bank's Domestic Lending Office. An amount shall not be deemed to have been paid by or on behalf of the Borrower on any day unless such amount has been received by the required Person, at the required place of payment, in Dollars in funds immediately available to such Person at such place, no later than 3:00 p.m. (New York time) on such day. (b) No Reductions. All payments due to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank under the Loan Documents shall be made, observed or performed by the Borrower without any reduction or deduction whatsoever, including any reduction or deduction for any set-off, recoupment, counterclaim (whether sounding in tort, contract or otherwise) or Tax, except, subject to Section 1.19, for any withholding or deduction for Taxes required to be withheld or deducted under Applicable Law. (c) Authorization to Charge Accounts. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Bank, if and to the extent any amount payable by the Borrower under the Loan Documents (whether payable to such Person or to any other Person that is the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or a Bank) is not otherwise paid when due, to charge such amount against any or all of the accounts of the Borrower with such Person or any of its Affiliates (whether maintained at a branch or office located within or without the United States), with the Borrower remaining liable for any deficiency. Any Bank charging an amount against an account of the Borrower shall provide notice thereof to the Borrower, within a reasonable time thereafter, which notice shall include a description in reasonable detail of such action. (d) Extension of Payment Dates. Whenever any payment to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank under the Loan Documents would otherwise be due on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment shall instead be due on the next succeeding Business Day. If the date any payment under the Loan Documents is due is extended (whether by operation of any Loan Document, Applicable Law or otherwise), such payment shall bear interest for such extended time at the rate of interest applicable hereunder. Section 1.18 Distribution of Payments by the Administrative Agent. (a) The Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to the Issuing Bank and each Bank its share of each payment received by the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents for the account of the Issuing Bank and the Banks; provided that, if at the time of distribution, any Bank is in default of a payment obligation to the Issuing Bank hereunder, the Administrative Agent may remit to the Issuing Bank so much of any amount otherwise distributable to such Bank as shall be necessary to cure such default. Distributions by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank or a Bank shall be made by credit to an account of the Issuing Bank or such Bank at the Administrative Agent's Office or by wire transfer to an account of the Issuing Bank or such Bank at an office of any other commercial bank located in the United States. 15
(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Issuing Bank or the Banks under the Loan Documents that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to the Issuing Bank and each Bank on such due date a corresponding amount with respect to the amount then due the Issuing Bank and such Bank. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall have so distributed to the Issuing Bank or any Bank a corresponding amount, the Issuing Bank or such Bank shall, on demand, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount so distributed together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to the Issuing Bank or such Bank until the date the Issuing Bank or such Bank repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate until (and including) the third Business Day after demand is made and thereafter at the Base Rate plus 2%. Section 1.19 Taxes. (a) (i) Taxes Payable by the Borrower. If under Applicable Law any Tax (other than Bank Taxes) is required to be withheld or deducted by the Borrower from, or is otherwise payable by the Borrower in connection with, any payment to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank under the Loan Documents, the Borrower (A) shall (1), if so required, withhold or deduct the amount of such Tax from such payment and, in any case, pay such Tax to the appropriate taxing authority in accordance with Applicable Law and (2) indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and such Bank in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.02(d) against its failure so to do and (B) shall, subject to Section 1.19(a)(iii), pay to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Bank, as applicable, such additional amounts as may be necessary so that the net amount received by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Bank with respect to such payment, after withholding or deducting all such Taxes required to be withheld or deducted by the Borrower, is equal to the full amount payable under the Loan Documents. If any such Tax is withheld or deducted by the Borrower from, or is otherwise payable by the Borrower in connection with, any payment payable to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank under the Loan Documents, the Borrower shall, as soon as possible after the date of such payment, furnish to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Bank, as applicable, the original or a certified copy of a receipt for such Tax from the applicable taxing authority. (ii) Taxes Payable by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank. The Borrower shall, promptly upon request by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank for the payment thereof, but subject to Section 1.19(a)(iii), pay to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be, all Taxes (other than Bank Taxes) payable by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be, with respect to any payment due to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Bank under the Loan Documents. (iii) Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional amount in respect of withholding of United States Federal income taxes pursuant to this Section 1.19 to any Bank except (A) in the case of a Person that is a Bank on the Agreement Date, to the extent such Taxes are required to 16
be withheld as a result of a Regulatory Change Enacted after the Agreement Date and (B) in the case of a Person that becomes a Bank after the Agreement Date, to the extent (1) such Taxes are required to be withheld as a result of a Regulatory Change Enacted after the date such Person becomes a Bank or (2) such additional amount would have been payable had such Person not become a Bank; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional amount in respect of withholding of United States Federal income taxes pursuant to this Section 1.19 to the extent such withholding is required because such Bank has failed to submit any form or certificate that it is entitled to so submit under Applicable Law. (iv) Exemption from US Withholding Taxes. There shall be submitted to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, (A) on or before the first date that interest or fees are payable to the Issuing Bank or such Bank under the Loan Documents, (1) if at the time the same are applicable, (aa) by each Bank that is not a United States Person and the Issuing Bank, if it is not a United States Person, two duly completed and signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or successor forms), in either case entitling the Issuing Bank or such Bank to a complete exemption from withholding of any United States federal income taxes on all amounts to be received by the Issuing Bank or such Bank under the Loan Documents, or (bb) by each Bank that is a Non-US Bank and the Issuing Bank if it is a Non-US Bank, (x) a duly completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or successor form) and (y) a certification in the form of Schedule 1.19(a)(iv) that the Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be, is a Non-US Bank or (2) if at the time any of the foregoing are inapplicable, duly completed and signed copies of such form, if any, as entitles the Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be, to exemption from withholding of United States federal income taxes to the maximum extent to which the Issuing Bank or such Bank is then entitled under Applicable Law, and (B) from time to time thereafter, prior to the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered form or upon any previously delivered form becoming inaccurate or inapplicable, such further duly completed and signed copies of such form, if any, as entitles the Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be, to exemption from withholding of United States Federal income taxes to the maximum extent to which such Person is then entitled under Applicable Law. The Issuing Bank and each Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent if (A) it is required to withdraw or cancel any form or certificate previously submitted by it or any such form or certificate has otherwise become ineffective or inaccurate or (B) payments to it are or will be subject to withholding of United States Federal income taxes to a greater extent than the extent to which payments to it were previously subject. Upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, each Bank that is a United States Person and the Issuing Bank if it is a United States Person shall from time to time submit to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a certificate to the effect that it is such a United States Person and a duly completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or successor form). (b) Credits and Deductions. If the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank obtains any credit, deduction or other reduction in Bank Taxes with respect to any payment made by the Borrower under Section 1.19(a)(i), the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be, shall pay to the Borrower such amount, not exceeding the increased amount paid by the Borrower, as is equal to the net after-tax value to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Bank, in its sole opinion, of such part of such credit, deduction or other reduction as it considers to be allocable to such payment by the Borrower, having regard to all of the Administrative Agent's, the Issuing Bank's or such Bank's 17
dealings giving rise to similar credits, deductions or other reductions in relation to the same tax period and to the cost of obtaining the same; provided, however, that (i) the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be, shall not be obligated to disclose to the Borrower any information regarding its tax affairs or computations and (ii) nothing in this Section 1.19(b) shall interfere with the right of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Bank to arrange its tax affairs as it deems appropriate. Section 1.20 Change of Lending Office. If an event occurs with respect to a Lending Office of any Bank or, in the case of any Letter of Credit or Drawing, the Issuing Bank, that obligates the Borrower to pay any amount under Section 1.19(a), makes operable the provisions of clause (a)(iii) or (iv), or (b), of Section 1.13 or entitles such Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to make a claim under Section 1.19(a) or 1.14, such Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts to designate another Lending Office or Offices the designation of which will reduce the amount the Borrower is so obligated to pay, eliminate such operability or reduce the amount such Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, is so entitled to claim, provided that such designation would not, in the sole and absolute discretion of such Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, be disadvantageous to such Bank or the Issuing Bank in any manner or contrary to such Bank's or the Issuing Bank's, as the case may be, policies. Each Bank and the Issuing Bank may at any time and from time to time change any Lending Office and shall give notice of any such change to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. Except in the case of a change in Lending Offices made at the request of the Borrower, the designation of a new Lending Office by any Bank or the Issuing Bank shall not obligate the Borrower to pay any amount to such Bank under Section 1.19(a), make operable the provisions of clause (a)(iii) or (a)(iv) or (b) of Section 1.13 or entitle such Bank or the Issuing Bank to make a claim under Section 1.19(a) or 1.14 if such obligation, the operability of such clause or such claim results solely from such designation and not from a Regulatory Change Enacted thereafter. Section 1.21 Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, (a) RC Loans of each Type to be made on any day shall be made by the Banks pro rata in accordance with their respective Commitments, (b) RC Loans of the Banks shall be converted and continued pro rata in accordance with their respective amounts of RC Loans of the Type and, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, having the Interest Period being so converted or continued, (c) each reduction in the Commitments shall be made pro rata in accordance with the respective amounts thereof and (d) each payment of the principal of or interest on the RC Loans, reimbursement of Drawings under Letters of Credit or of facility and letter of credit fees shall be made for the account of the Banks pro rata in accordance with the respective amounts thereof then due to the Banks. Section 1.22 Sharing of Recoveries. Each Bank agrees that, if, for any reason, including as a result of (a) the exercise of any right of counterclaim, set-off, banker's lien or similar right, (b) its claim in any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law being deemed secured by a Debt owed by it to the Borrower, including a claim deemed secured under Section 506 of the Bankruptcy Code, or (c) the allocation of payments by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower in a manner contrary to the provisions of Section 1.21, such Bank shall receive payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount due and payable to it hereunder as principal of or interest on the Loans or Letter of Credit Participations or fees that is greater than 18
the proportion received by any other Bank in respect of the aggregate of such amounts due and payable to such other Bank hereunder, then the Bank receiving such proportionately greater payment shall purchase participations (which it shall be deemed to have done simultaneously upon the receipt of such payment) in the rights of the other Banks hereunder so that all such recoveries with respect to such amounts due and payable hereunder (net of costs of collection) shall be pro rata; provided, however, that no such participation shall be deemed to have been so purchased in any Bid Rate Loans of any of the other Banks; provided, further, that if all or part of such proportionately greater payment received by the purchasing Bank is thereafter recovered by or on behalf of the Borrower from such Bank, such purchases shall be rescinded and the purchase prices paid for such participations shall be returned to such Bank to the extent of such recovery, but without interest (unless the purchasing Bank is required to pay interest on the amount recovered to the Person recovering such amount, in which case the selling Bank shall be required to pay interest at a like rate). The Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements and agrees that any holder of a participation in any rights hereunder so purchased or acquired pursuant to this Section 1.22 shall, with respect to such participation, be entitled to all of the rights of a Bank under Sections 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.19, 1.20, 8.02, and 8.07 (subject to any condition imposed on a Bank hereunder with respect thereto, including delivery of the forms and certificates required under Section 1.19(a)(iv)) and may exercise any and all rights of set-off with respect to such participation as fully as though the Borrower were directly indebted to the holder of such participation for Loans in the amount of such participation. Section 1.23 Bank Obligations Several. The obligations of the Banks under this Agreement are several and not joint. Any Bank's failure to make any Loan to be made by it on the requested date therefor shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation to make any Loan to be made by such other Bank on such date, but such other Bank shall not be liable for such failure. Any Participating Bank's failure to fund its participation in a Drawing shall not relieve any other Participating Bank of its obligation to fund its participation in such Drawing, but such other Participating Bank shall not be liable for such failure. Section 1.24 Disbursement to Borrower by Administrative Agent Prior to Receipt of Funds. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on the requested date for the making of any Loans that such Bank will not make available to the Administrative Agent the Loans to be made by such Bank on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such Loans available to the Administrative Agent on such date in accordance with Section 1.01(c) or 1.02(e), as the case may be, and the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount on behalf of such Bank. If and to the extent such Bank shall not have so made available to the Administrative Agent the Loans to be made by such Bank on such date and the Administrative Agent shall have so made available to the Borrower a corresponding amount on behalf of such Bank, such Bank shall, on demand, pay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount shall have been so made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower until the date such amount shall have been repaid to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate until (and including) the third Business Day after demand is made and thereafter at the Base Rate plus 2%. If such Bank does not pay such corresponding amount promptly upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Borrower shall immediately 19
repay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent together with accrued interest thereon at the applicable rate or rates provided in Section 1.04(a). Section 1.25 Extension of Termination Date. (a) Not more than 45 days and not less than 30 days prior to the Termination Date, the Borrower may request in writing that the Banks extend the Termination Date for an additional 364 days. Each Bank shall provide the Administrative Agent, not more than 30 days and not less than 15 days prior to the Termination Date, written notice regarding whether it agrees to extend the Termination Date. Each decision by a Bank shall be in its sole discretion and failure by a Bank to give timely written notice hereunder shall be deemed a decision by such Bank not to extend the Termination Date. If the Required Banks timely agree in writing to extend the Termination Date, then the Termination Date shall be extended, effective as of the old Termination Date, for an additional 364 days pursuant to a duly executed written amendment to this Credit Agreement. (b) If any Bank fails to agree to extend the Termination Date (a "Refusing Bank"), then the Borrower may, on or before the Termination Date in effect prior to the extension to which such Refusing Bank has not agreed, at its own discretion and its own expense, request any Refusing Bank to (and such Refusing Bank shall thereupon be required to) assign in whole (but not in part), without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the terms of Section 8.08(a)), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement to one or more Persons (which may be one or more existing Banks if any existing Bank accepts such assignment); provided that (i) such assignment or assignments shall not conflict with any Applicable Law, (ii) the Borrower or such assignee or assignees shall pay to such Refusing Bank in immediately available funds the principal of and interest accrued to the date of such payment on the Loans and funded participations in Drawings held by such Refusing Bank and all other amounts accrued or owing to such Refusing Banks hereunder, as well as any transfer fee owing to the Administrative Agent under Section 8.08(a), and (iii) such assignment must occur on or prior to the Termination Date. (c) If any Refusing Bank is not required to assign its interests pursuant to Section 1.25(b), then, on the Termination Date in effect prior to the extension to which such Refusing Bank has not agreed, (i) the Borrower shall pay to such Refusing Bank in immediately available funds the principal of and interest accrued to the date of such payment on the Loans and funded participations in Drawings held by such Refusing Bank and all other amounts accrued or owing to such Refusing Bank hereunder, and (ii) such Refusing Bank's Commitment shall be permanently terminated. ARTICLE II CONDITIONS TO LOANS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT Section 2.01 Conditions to Initial Loans and Letters of Credit. The obligation of each Bank to make its initial Loan (whether such initial Loans are RC Loans or Bid Rate Loans) or the Issuing Bank to issue the initial Letter of Credit hereunder, whichever shall first occur, is subject to the determination of each Bank and the Issuing Bank, each in its sole and absolute discretion, that each of the following conditions has been fulfilled: 20

Section 2.02 Conditions to Each Loan and Letter of Credit. The obligation of each Bank to make each Loan requested to be made by it, including its initial Loan, and the obligation of the Issuing Bank to issue each Letter of Credit requested to be issued by it (including any request to extend the expiry date of any Letter of Credit to a date beyond the then current expiry date thereof or any automatic renewal thereof as provided in Section 1.03(b)), is subject to the determination of the Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be, each in its sole and absolute discretion, that each of the following conditions has been fulfilled: (a) the Administrative Agent shall have received (i) in the case of an RC Loan, a notice of borrowing with respect to such Loan in accordance with the requirements of Section 1.01, (ii) in the case of a Bid Rate Loan, notice of acceptance of an offer by such Bank to make such Loan in accordance with the requirements of Section 1.02, or (iii) in the case of a Letter of Credit, a notice of a request for issuance with respect to such Letter of Credit in accordance with the requirements of Section 1.03; (b) each Representation and Warranty shall be true and correct at and as of the time such Loan is to be made or Letter of Credit issued, both with and without giving effect to such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit and all other Loans and Letters of Credit to be made or issued at such time and to the application of the proceeds thereof; (c) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time such Loan is to be made or such Letter of Credit is to be issued or would result from the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit and all other Loans and Letters of Credit to be made or issued at such time or from the application of the proceeds thereof; (d) in the case of any such Loan, such Loan will not contravene any Applicable Law applicable to such Bank, including Regulation U; and 22

No such disclosure by the Borrower that a condition specified in clause (b) or (c) above will not be fulfilled as of the requested time for the making of the requested Loans or the issuance of the requested Letter of Credit shall affect the right of each Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to not make the Loans requested to be made by it or to not issue the Letter of Credit requested to be issued by it if, in such Bank's or the Issuing Bank's determination, such condition has not been fulfilled at such time. ARTICLE III REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES In order to induce the Administrative Agent, each Bank and the Issuing Bank to enter into this Agreement and to make each Loan requested to be made by it or to issue each Letter of Credit, the Borrower represents and warrants as follows: Section 3.01 Organization; Power; Qualification. The Borrower and each Significant Subsidiary are corporations duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of their respective jurisdictions of incorporation, have the corporate power and authority to own their respective properties and to carry on their respective businesses as now being and hereafter proposed to be conducted and are duly qualified and in good standing as foreign corporations, and are authorized to do business, in all jurisdictions in which the character of their respective properties or the nature of their respective businesses requires such qualification or authorization, except for qualifications or authorizations the lack of which, singly or in the aggregate, has not and will not have a Materially Adverse Effect on the Borrower and the Consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Section 3.02 Subsidiaries. Schedule 3.02 sets forth, as of the Agreement Date, all of the Subsidiaries, their jurisdictions of incorporation, the percentages of the various classes of their Capital Securities owned by the Borrower or another Subsidiary, which Subsidiaries are Consolidated Subsidiaries and which Subsidiaries are Significant Subsidiaries. The Borrower or another Subsidiary, as the case may be, has the unrestricted right to vote, and (subject to limitations imposed by Applicable Law) to receive dividends and distributions on, all Capital Securities of the Significant Subsidiaries indicated on Schedule 3.02 as owned by the Borrower 23
or such Subsidiary. All such Capital Securities have been duly authorized and issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. Section 3.03 Authorization; Enforceability; Required Consents; Absence of Conflicts.

This Agreement has been, and each of the other Loan Documents when delivered to the Administrative Agent will have been, duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and is, or when so delivered will be, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally. The execution, delivery and performance in accordance with their respective terms by the Borrower of the Loan Documents, and each borrowing of Loans and issuance of Letters of Credit, whether or not in the maximum amount then available hereunder, do not and (absent any change in any Applicable Law or applicable Contract) will not (a) require any Governmental Approval or any other consent or approval, including any consent or approval of the stockholders of the Borrower, to have been obtained or any Governmental Registration to have been made, by the Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary, other than Governmental Approvals and other consents and approvals and Governmental Registrations that have been obtained or made, as the case may be, are final and not subject to review on appeal or to collateral attack, are in full force and effect and, in the case of any such required under any Applicable Law or Contract as in effect on the Agreement Date, are listed on Schedule 3.03, or (b) violate, conflict with, result in a breach of, constitute a default under, or result in or require the creation of any Lien upon any assets of the Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary under, (i) any Contract to which the Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary is a party or by which the Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary or any of their respective properties may be bound or (ii) any Applicable Law.

Section 3.05 Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.05, there are not, in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any governmental or non-governmental body, any actions, suits or proceedings pending or threatened (nor, to the knowledge of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, is there any basis therefor) against or in any other way relating to or affecting (a) such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses or properties or (b) any Loan Document, except actions, suits or proceedings that (x) could not, singly or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected (taking into account the likelihood of an adverse determination) to have a Materially Adverse Effect on the Borrower and its Consolidated 24
Subsidiaries taken as a whole and (y) if adversely determined, would not, singly or in the aggregate, have a Materially Adverse Effect on any Loan Document. Section 3.06 Financial Statements. The financial statements set forth on Schedule 3.06 fairly present, in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, (i) in the case of the financial statements of New Century Energies, Inc., the consolidated financial position of New Century Energies, Inc. and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as at their respective dates and the consolidated results of operations, retained earnings and, as applicable, changes in financial position or cash flows of New Century Energies, Inc. and such Subsidiaries for the respective periods to which such statements relate, (ii) in the case of the financial statements of Northern States Power Company, the consolidated financial position of Northern States Power Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as at their respective dates and the consolidated results of operations, retained earnings and, as applicable, changes in financial position or cash flows of Northern States Power Company and such Subsidiaries for the respective periods to which such statements relate, and (iii) in the case of the pro-forma financial statements of the Borrower, the consolidated pro-forma financial position of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries (after giving effect to the merger of Northern States Power Company and New Century Energies, Inc) as at their respective dates and the consolidated results of operations, retained earnings and, as applicable, changes in financial position or cash flows of the Borrower and such Subsidiaries for the respective periods to which such statements relate.

Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10, there have been no releases or disposals of hazardous wastes, environmental contaminants or other substances in quantities or locations that, singly or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in the incurrence by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of remedial obligations under Applicable Law that could reasonably be expected to have a Materially Adverse Effect on the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice or order advising it that it has or may have any remedial obligation with respect to any such releases or disposals or that it is or may be responsible for the costs of any remedial action taken or to be taken by any other Persons with respect to any such releases or disposals, which obligation or cost, if fully payable could reasonably be expected to, singly or in the aggregate, have a Materially Adverse Effect on the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Section 3.11 Accuracy of Information. The Information furnished to the Administrative Agent or the Banks by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary on or prior to the Agreement Date (other than the financial statements referred to in Section 3.06) does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made.

ARTICLE VII THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT Section 7.01 Appointment and Powers. Each Bank hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes The Bank of New York, and The Bank of New York hereby agrees, to act as the agent for such Bank under the Loan Documents with such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms thereof, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent's duties shall be purely ministerial and it shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent shall not be required under any circumstances to take any action that, in its judgment, (a) is contrary to any provision of the Loan Documents or Applicable Law or (b) would expose it to any Liability or expense against which it has not been indemnified to its satisfaction. The Administrative Agent shall not, by reason of its serving as the Administrative Agent, be a trustee or other fiduciary for any Bank. Section 7.02 Limitation on Administrative Agent's Liability. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable or responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with the Loan Documents, except for its or their own gross negligence, willful misconduct or knowing violations of law. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to any Bank for (a) any recitals, statements, representations or warranties contained in the Loan Documents or in any certificate or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by any of the Banks under, the Loan Documents, (b) the validity, effectiveness or enforceability of the Loan Documents or any such certificate or other document or (c) any failure by the Borrower to perform any of its obligations under the Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for the negligence or 34
misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact so long as the Administrative Agent was not grossly negligent in selecting or directing such agents or attorneys-in-fact. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any certification, notice or other communication (including any thereof by telephone, telex, telecopier, telegram or cable) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or given by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. As to any matters not expressly provided for by the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under the Loan Documents in accordance with instructions signed by the Required Banks, and such instructions of the Required Banks and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Banks. Section 7.03 Defaults. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of the occurrence of a Default (other than the non-payment to it of principal of or interest on Loans or fees) unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Bank or the Borrower specifying such Default and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default". In the event that the Administrative Agent has knowledge of such a non-payment or receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Banks. In the event of any Default, the Administrative Agent shall (a) in the case of a Default that constitutes an Event of Default, take any of the actions referred to in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of the first sentence of Section 6.02 if so directed by the Required Banks and (b) in the case of any Default, take such other action with respect to such Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Banks. Unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, in the event of any Default, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Banks. Section 7.04 Rights as a Bank. Each Person acting as the Administrative Agent that is also a Bank shall, in its capacity as a Bank, have the same rights and powers under the Loan Documents as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not acting as the Administrative Agent, and the term "Bank" or "Banks" shall include such Person in its individual capacity. Each Person acting as the Administrative Agent (whether or not such Person is a Bank) and its Affiliates may (without having to account therefor to any Bank) accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with the Borrower and its Affiliates as if it were not acting as the Administrative Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower and its Affiliates for services in connection with the Loan Documents or otherwise without having to account for the same to the Banks. Section 7.05 Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower hereunder), ratably on the basis of the respective principal amounts of the Loans outstanding made by the Banks (or, if no Loans are at the time outstanding, ratably on the basis of their respective Commitments), for any and all Liabilities, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (including the costs and expenses that the Borrower is obligated to pay hereunder) in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any other documents 35
contemplated thereby or referred to therein or the transactions contemplated thereby or the enforcement of any of the terms thereof or of any such other documents, provided that no Bank shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from gross negligence, willful misconduct or knowing violations of law by the Administrative Agent. Section 7.06 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Banks. Each Bank agrees that it has made and will continue to make, independently and without reliance on the Administrative Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it deems appropriate, its own credit analysis of the Borrower and its own decision to enter into the Loan Documents and to take or refrain from taking any action in connection therewith. The Administrative Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by the Borrower of the Loan Documents or any other document referred to or provided for therein or to inspect the properties or books of the Borrower or any Subsidiary. Except for notices, reports and other documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to provide any Bank with any information concerning the business, status or condition of the Borrower or any Subsidiary or the Loan Documents that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates. Section 7.07 Resignation of the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Banks and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Banks may, after consultation with the Borrower, appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Banks and after consultation with the Borrower, appoint a successor Administrative Agent. Upon the acceptance by any Person of its appointment as a successor Administrative Agent, such Person shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges, duties and obligations of the retiring Administrative Agent and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article VI shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent.

Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 8.08, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Bank under this Agreement, and the assigning Bank thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of a Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto). Any assignment or transfer by a Bank of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Bank of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section 8.08. (b) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in New York City a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks, and the Commitments of, amount of Letter of Credit Participations held by, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Bank pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register").

The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Bank, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (c) Any Bank may, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Bank's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment, Letter of Credit Participations and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Banks shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations 41
under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Bank sells such a participation shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Bank will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in Section 8.06(a) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (d) of this Section 8.08, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 1.14, 1.15 and 1.19 to the same extent as if it were a Bank and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 8.08. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 8.07 as though it were a Bank, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 1.22 as though it were a Bank. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 1.15 or 1.19 than the applicable Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Non-US Bank if it were a Bank shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 1.19 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 1.19(a)(iv) as though it were a Bank.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Bank (a "Granting Bank") may grant to one special purpose funding vehicle (an "SPC") sponsored by such Granting Bank, as identified as such in writing from time to time to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Bank would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to the terms hereof; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment to make any Loan by any SPC and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Bank shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of such Granting Bank to the same extent as if such Loan were made by such Granting Bank. Any SPC that makes a Loan shall (i) have in regard to such Loan all of the rights (exercisable, however, only through its Granting Bank as its agent) that such Granting Bank would have had if it had made such Loan directly and (ii) comply with this Agreement in regard to such Loan on the same terms as any other party hereto; provided that (A) the Granting Bank's Commitment shall remain with such Granting Bank and (B) all monetary obligations of an SPC hereunder in respect of the Loans it provides shall remain with its Granting Bank to the extent at any time that such SPC elects not to or otherwise fails to perform or pay any such obligation. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any payment under this Agreement for which a Bank would otherwise be liable so long as, and to the extent, its sponsoring Granting Bank makes such payment. Notwithstanding any Loans that may be provided by an SPC hereunder, the Administrative Agent and Borrower shall be entitled to continue to communicate and deal solely and directly with the Granting Bank in connection with this Agreement in respect of such Loans. 42
Each SPC that is identified by its Granting Bank as having been granted an option hereunder shall be deemed to have confirmed (and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may require a written acknowledgment of such confirmation signed by any such SPC) to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that (a) it has received a copy of each Loan Document, together with copies of the financial statements heretofore provided to Banks under the terms of this Agreement and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement; (b) agrees that it will independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, its Granting Bank or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under any Loan Document; (c) appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under any Loan Document as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms thereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto; (d) agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of any Loan Document are required to be performed by it as a Bank, subject to the terms of this Section; and (e) appoints its Granting Bank, or a specified branch or affiliate thereof, as its agent and attorney in fact, and grants to its Granting Bank an irrevocable power of attorney, to receive payments made for the benefit such SPC under this Agreement, to deliver and receive all communications and notices under the Loan Documents and to exercise on such SPC's behalf all rights to vote and to grant and make approvals, waivers, consents or amendments to or under the Loan Documents. Any document executed by an SPC's Granting Bank on such SPC's behalf in connection with the Loan Documents shall be binding on such SPC. The Borrower, all the Banks and the Administrative Agent each hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or similar proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 8.08(a), any SPC may, with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and without the payment of any processing and recordation fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to its Granting Bank. Any SPC may disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of liquidity and/or credit facilities to such SPC. Nothing in this Section that would affect the rights or obligations of an SPC may be amended without the written consent of any SPC that has Loans outstanding at the time of such amendment.
