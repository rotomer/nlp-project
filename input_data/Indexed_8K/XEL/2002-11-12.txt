Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business and is in good standing in every jurisdiction in which its ownership of property or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" means any material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, operations, results of operations, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on the transactions contemplated hereby or by the agreements and instruments to be entered into in connection herewith, or on the authority or ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents (as defined below). The Company has no Subsidiaries except as set forth in the SEC Documents (as defined below). (b) Authorization; Enforcement; Validity. The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Notes, the Registration Rights Agreement, the Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions (as defined in Section 5) and each of the other agreements entered into by the parties hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS") and to issue the Securities in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof. The execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including without limitation the issuance of the Notes and the reservation for issuance and the issuance of the Conversion Shares issuable upon conversion thereof, have been duly authorized by the Company's Board of Directors and no further consent or authorization is required by the Company, its Board of Directors or its stockholders. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents of even date herewith have been duly executed and delivered by the Company, and constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in 9
accordance with their terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by general principles of equity or applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, liquidation or similar laws relating to, or affecting generally, the enforcement of creditors' rights and remedies. (c) Issuance of Securities. The Notes are duly authorized and, upon issuance in accordance with the terms hereof, shall be free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof. At least 115% of the number of shares of Common Stock necessary to satisfy all of the Company's obligations pursuant to the First Notes and Second Notes have been duly authorized and reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Notes. Upon conversion in accordance with the Notes, the Conversion Shares will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof, with the holders being entitled to all rights accorded to a holder of Common Stock. Assuming the accuracy of the representations, warranties and covenants of the Buyers set forth herein, the issuance by the Company of the Securities is exempt from registration under the 1933 Act. (d) No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction Documents by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including, without limitation, the issuance of the Notes and reservation for issuance and issuance of the Conversion Shares) will not (i) result in a violation of the certificate of incorporation, any certificate of designations, preferences and rights of any outstanding series of preferred stock or bylaws of the Company or any Subsidiary or (ii) conflict with, or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, any material agreement, indenture or instrument to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or (iii) result in a violation of any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree (including federal and state utilities and securities laws and regulations and the rules and regulations of the Principal Market (as defined below)) applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or affected. (e) Consents. Except as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, the Company is not required to obtain any consent, authorization or order of, or make any filing or registration with, any court, governmental agency or any regulatory or self-regulatory agency or any other Person in order for it to execute, deliver or perform any of its obligations under or contemplated by the Transaction Documents, in each case in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof, except for such consents, authorizations, orders, filings and registrations which have been obtained or effected on or prior to the date hereof. The Company and its Subsidiaries are unaware of any facts or circumstances which might prevent the Company from obtaining or effecting any of the foregoing. The Company is not in violation of the listing requirements of the Principal Market and has no actual knowledge of any facts which would reasonably lead to delisting or suspension of the Common Stock in the foreseeable future.

The Company shall keep the register open and available at all times during business hours for inspection of any Buyer or its legal representatives. (b) Transfer Agent Instructions. The Company shall issue irrevocable instructions to its transfer agent, and any subsequent transfer agent, to issue certificates or credit shares to the applicable balance accounts at DTC, registered in the name of each Buyer or its respective nominee(s), for the Conversion Shares in such amounts as specified from time to time by each Buyer to the Company upon conversion of the Notes in the form of Exhibit I attached hereto (the "IRREVOCABLE TRANSFER AGENT INSTRUCTIONS"). The Company warrants that no instruction other than the Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions referred to in this Section 5(b), and stop transfer instructions to give effect to Section 2(f) hereof will be given by the Company to its transfer agent, and that the Securities shall otherwise be freely transferable on the books and records of the Company as and to the extent provided in this Agreement, the Notes and the Registration Rights Agreement. If a Buyer effects a sale, assignment or transfer of the Securities in accordance with Section 2(f), the Company shall permit the transfer, and shall promptly instruct its transfer agent to issue one or more certificates or credit shares to the applicable balance accounts at DTC in such name and in such denominations as specified by such Buyer to effect such sale, transfer or assignment.

Each party shall do and perform, or cause to be done and performed, all such further acts and things, and shall execute and deliver all such other agreements, certificates, instruments and documents, as the other party may reasonably request in order to carry out the intent and accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. (k) Indemnification. In consideration of each Buyer's execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents and acquiring the Securities thereunder and in addition to all of 34
the Company's other obligations under the Transaction Documents, the Company shall defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless each Buyer and each other holder of the Securities and all of their stockholders, partners, members, officers, directors, employees and direct or indirect investors and any of the foregoing Persons' agents or other representatives (including, without limitation, those retained in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (collectively, the "INDEMNITEES") from and against any and all actions, causes of action, suits, claims, losses, costs, penalties, fees, liabilities and damages, and expenses in connection therewith (irrespective of whether any such Indemnitee is a party to the action for which indemnification hereunder is sought), and including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements (the "INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES"), incurred by any Indemnitee as a result of, or arising out of, or relating to (a) any misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company in the Transaction Documents or any other certificate, instrument or document contemplated hereby or thereby, (b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation of the Company contained in the Transaction Documents or any other certificate, instrument or document contemplated hereby or thereby or (c) any cause of action, suit or claim brought or made against such Indemnitee by a third party (including for these purposes a derivative action brought on behalf of the Company) and arising out of or resulting from (i) the execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of the Transaction Documents or any other certificate, instrument or document contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) any transaction financed or to be financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, with the proceeds of the issuance of the Securities, (iii) any disclosure made by such Buyer pursuant to Section 4(j), or (iv) the status of such Buyer or holder of the Securities as an investor in the Company. To the extent that the foregoing undertaking by the Company may be unenforceable for any reason, the Company shall make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the Indemnified Liabilities which is permissible under applicable law. Except as otherwise set forth herein, the mechanics and procedures with respect to the rights and obligations under this Section 9(k) shall be the same as those set forth in Section 6 of the Registration Rights Agreement. (l) No Strict Construction. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rules of strict construction will be applied against any party. (m) Remedies. Each Buyer and each holder of the Securities shall have all rights and remedies set forth in the Transaction Documents and all rights and remedies which such holders have been granted at any time under any other agreement or contract and all of the rights which such holders have under any law. Any Person having any rights under any provision of this Agreement shall be entitled to enforce such rights specifically (without posting a bond or other security), to recover damages by reason of any breach of any provision of this Agreement and to exercise all other rights granted by law. Furthermore, the Company recognizes that in the event that it fails to perform, observe, or discharge any or all of its obligations under this Agreement, any remedy at law may prove to be inadequate relief to the Buyers. The Company therefore agrees that the Buyers shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief in any such case without the necessity of proving actual damages and without posting a bond or other security. (n) Payment Set Aside. To the extent that the Company makes a payment or 35
payments to the Buyers hereunder or pursuant to any of the other Transaction Documents or the Buyers enforce or exercise their rights hereunder or thereunder, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or exercise or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, recovered from, disgorged by or are required to be refunded, repaid or otherwise restored to the Company, a trustee, receiver or any other Person under any law (including, without limitation, any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause of action), then to the extent of any such restoration the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.

NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THIS NOTE AND THE SECURITIES ISSUABLE UPON CONVERSION HEREOF MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT OR OTHER LOAN OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENT SECURED BY THIS NOTE. ANY TRANSFEREE OF THIS NOTE SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE TERMS OF THIS NOTE, INCLUDING SECTIONS 3(c)(iii) AND 18(a) HEREOF. THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT REPRESENTED BY THIS NOTE AND THE SECURITIES ISSUABLE UPON CONVERSION HEREOF MAY BE LESS THAN THE AMOUNTS SET FORTH ON THE FACE HEREOF PURSUANT TO SECTION 3(c)(iii) OF THIS NOTE. XCEL ENERGY, INC. Issuance Date: November 8, 2002 Principal: U.S. FOR VALUE RECEIVED, XCEL ENERGY INC., a Minnesota corporation (the "COMPANY"), hereby promises to pay to the order of or registered assigns ("HOLDER") the amount set out above as the Principal (as reduced pursuant to the terms hereof pursuant to redemption, conversion or otherwise, the "PRINCIPAL") when due, whether upon the Final Maturity Date (as defined below), acceleration, conversion, redemption or otherwise (in each case in accordance with the terms hereof) and to pay interest ("INTEREST") on any outstanding Principal at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum, subject to periodic adjustment pursuant to Section 2 (the "INTEREST RATE"), from the date set out above as the Issuance Date (the "ISSUANCE DATE") until the same becomes due and payable, whether upon an Interest Date (as defined below), the Final Maturity Date, acceleration, conversion, redemption or otherwise (in each case in accordance with the terms hereof). This Convertible Note (including all Convertible Notes issued in exchange, transfer or replacement hereof, this "NOTE") is one of an issue of Convertible Notes (collectively, the "NOTES" and such other Convertible Notes, the "OTHER NOTES") issued on the Issuance Date pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement (as defined below). Certain capitalized terms are defined in Section 28 and terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth for such terms in the Securities Purchase Agreement.
(1) MATURITY. On the Final Maturity Date, the Holder shall surrender this Note to the Company and the Company shall pay to the Holder an amount in cash representing all outstanding Principal, accrued and unpaid Interest and accrued and unpaid Late Charges (as defined in Section 24(b)), if any. The "MATURITY DATE" shall be the date that is 364 days after the Issuance Date; provided that, if the Holder has given notice in writing to the Company of its desire to extend the Maturity Date on or prior to the date that is 10 Business Days prior to the Maturity Date, the Maturity Date shall be extended (on one or more occasions) for an additional 364 days; provided, further, that the Maturity Date shall not be extended (except as provided in the following proviso) to more than five years after the Issuance Date (such date that is five years after the Issuance Date or such earlier Maturity Date prior to which the Holder has not requested an extension thereof, the "FINAL MATURITY DATE"); and provided, further, that the Final Maturity Date may be extended at the option of the Holder (x) in the event that, and for so long as, an Event of Default (as defined in Section 4(a)) shall have occurred and be continuing or any event shall have occurred and be continuing which with the passage of time and the failure to cure would result in an Event of Default and (y) through the date that is ten days after a Change of Control Termination Date in the event that the Announcement Date giving rise to such Change of Control Termination Date occurred prior to the Final Maturity Date. (2) INTEREST; INTEREST RATE. Interest on this Note shall commence accruing on the Issuance Date and shall be computed on the basis of the actual days elapsed during any period, and a calendar year of 365 or 366 calendar days, as applicable, and shall be payable in cash on each May 1 and each November 1 during the period beginning on the Issuance Date and ending on, and including, the Final Maturity Date (each an "INTEREST DATE"); provided that interest on any Conversion Amount of this Note that is accrued but unpaid as of the Conversion Date of such Conversion Amount shall be paid in shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate. From and after the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in Section 4(a)) or the failure to deliver timely the Non-Consolidation Opinion (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement) pursuant to Section 4(f) of the Securities Purchase Agreement (the "NRG OPINION"), the Interest Rate shall be increased by two percentage points (2%). In the event that such Event of Default is subsequently cured, the adjustment referred to in the preceding sentence shall cease to be effective as of the date of such cure; provided that the Interest as calculated at such increased rate during the continuance of such Event of Default shall continue to apply to the extent relating to the days after the occurrence of such Event of Default through and including the date of cure of such Event of Default. If the Company shall fail to credit the Holder's balance account with DTC (as defined in Section 3(c)(i)) or, if requested in writing by the Holder, to issue a certificate to the Holder for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled upon conversion of any Conversion Amount or to issue a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) representing the Principal portion of the Conversion Amount (as defined in Section 3(b)(i)) to which the Holder is entitled, in each case within the time periods set out in Section 3(c)(i) (in each case, a "CONVERSION FAILURE"), then during each period beginning on and including the date of each such Conversion Failure and ending on and including the date such Conversion Failure is cured, the Interest Rate then in effect shall be increased by two percentage points (2%). If (i) the Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) covering all the Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) issuable upon conversion of this Note and required to be filed by 2
the Company pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement is not declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on or before the applicable Mandatory Effective Date (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) or (ii) on any day after such Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC that sales of all the Registrable Securities required to be included on such Registration Statement cannot be made (other than during an Allowable Grace Period (as defined in Section 3(t) of the Registration Rights Agreement)) pursuant to such Registration Statement (including, without limitation, because of a failure to keep such Registration Statement effective, to disclose such information as is necessary for sales to be made pursuant to such Registration Statement or to register sufficient shares of Common Stock) (collectively with the event described in the immediately preceding clause (i), each a "REGISTRATION FAILURE"), then, as partial relief for the damages to any holder by reason of any such delay in or reduction of its ability to sell Registrable Securities (which remedy shall not be exclusive of any other remedies available at law or in equity) the Interest Rate then in effect shall be increased by two percentage points (2%) during each period beginning on and including the first date of each such Registration Failure and ending on and including the date such Registration Failure is cured. (3) CONVERSION OF NOTES. This Note shall be convertible into shares of the Common Stock, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 3. (a) Conversion Right. Subject to the provisions of Section 3(d), at any time or times on or after the Issuance Date, the Holder shall be entitled to convert any portion of the outstanding and unpaid Conversion Amount (as defined below) into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 3(c), at the Conversion Rate (as defined below). The Company shall not issue any fraction of a share of Common Stock upon any conversion. If the issuance would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of Common Stock, the Company shall round such fraction of a share of Common Stock up to the nearest whole share. The Company shall pay any and all taxes that may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of Common Stock upon conversion of any Conversion Amount. (b) Conversion Rate. The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any Conversion Amount pursuant to Section 3(a) shall be determined by dividing (x) such Conversion Amount by (y) the Conversion Price (as defined below) (the "CONVERSION RATE"). (i) "CONVERSION AMOUNT" means the sum of (A) the portion of the Principal to be converted, redeemed or otherwise surrendered with respect to which this determination is being made, (B) accrued and unpaid Interest with respect to such Principal and (C) accrued and unpaid Late Charges with respect to such Principal and Interest. (ii) "CONVERSION PRICE" means 110% of the Weighted Average Price of the Common Stock during the Tranche A Pricing Period; provided that the Conversion Price (i) shall not exceed 110% of the Tranche A Base Price and (ii) shall equal the Company Optional Redemption Conversion Price until such time as the Tranche A Pricing Period has concluded; provided further, that in the event that the Company has not delivered a Company Optional Redemption Notice as of the date that is 35 Business Days after the 3
Issuance Date and 110% of the Closing Bid Price of the Common Stock on such date is less than the Conversion Price then in effect, then the Conversion Price shall be reduced to equal such price. (c) Mechanics of Conversion. (i) Optional Conversion. To convert any Conversion Amount into shares of Common Stock on any date (a "CONVERSION DATE"), the Holder shall (A) transmit by facsimile (or otherwise deliver), for receipt on or prior to 11:59 p.m., Central Time on such date, a copy of an executed notice of conversion in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I (the "CONVERSION NOTICE") to the Company and (B) if required by Section 3(c)(ii), surrender this Note to a common carrier for delivery to the Company as soon as practicable on or following such date (or an indemnification undertaking with respect to this Note in the case of its loss, theft or destruction). On or before the first Business Day following the Company's receipt of a Conversion Notice, the Company shall transmit by facsimile a confirmation of receipt of such Conversion Notice to the Holder and the Transfer Agent (as defined below). On or before the second Business Day following the date of receipt of a Conversion Notice (the "SHARE DELIVERY DATE"), the Company shall (X) (if (Y) below does not apply) issue and deliver to the address as specified in the Conversion Notice, a certificate, registered in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled, or (Y) provided that the Company's transfer agent (the "TRANSFER AGENT") is participating in The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, upon the request of the Holder, credit such aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled to the Holder's or its designee's balance account with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission system. If this Note is physically surrendered for conversion as required by Section 3(c)(ii) and the outstanding Principal of this Note is greater than the Principal portion of the Conversion Amount being converted, then the Company shall as soon as practicable and in no event later than three Business Days after receipt of this Note (the "NOTE DELIVERY DATE") and at its own expense, issue and deliver to the holder a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) representing the outstanding Principal not converted. The person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon a conversion of this Note shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on the Conversion Date. (ii) Book-Entry. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of any portion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Company unless (A) the full Conversion Amount represented by this Note is being converted or (B) the Holder has provided the Company with prior written notice (which notice may be included in a Conversion Notice) requesting physical surrender and reissue of this Note. The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the Principal and Interest converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon conversion. 4
(iii) Pro Rata Conversion; Disputes. In the event that the Company receives a Conversion Notice from more than one holder of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes for the same Conversion Date and the Company can convert some, but not all, of such portions of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes submitted for conversion, the Company, subject to Section 3(d), shall convert from each holder of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes electing to have the Notes or Separate Tranche Notes converted on such date a pro rata amount of such holder's portion of its Notes or Separate Tranche Notes submitted for conversion based on the principal amount of the Notes or Separate Tranche Notes submitted for conversion on such date by such holder relative to the aggregate principal amount of all the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes submitted for conversion on such date. In the event of a dispute as to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable to the Holder in connection with a conversion of this Note, the Company shall issue to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock not in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 23. (d) Limitations on Conversions. (i) Beneficial Ownership. The Company shall not effect any conversion of this Note, and the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to convert any portion of this Note pursuant to Section 3(a), to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion, the Holder (together with the Holder's affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 5.0% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note with respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (A) conversion of the remaining, nonconverted portion of this Note beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its affiliates and (B) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any Other Notes, Separate Tranche Notes or warrants) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its affiliates. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 3(d)(i), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. For purposes of this Section 3(d)(i), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (x) the Company's most recent Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (z) any other notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of the Holder, the Company shall within one Business Day confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Note, by the Holder or its affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. 5
(ii) Principal Market Regulation. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Note if the issuance of such shares of Common Stock would exceed that number of shares of Common Stock which the Company may issue pursuant to the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes without breaching the Company's obligations under the rules or regulations of the Principal Market (the "EXCHANGE CAP"), except that such limitation shall not apply in the event that the Company (A) obtains the approval of its shareholders as required by the applicable rules of the Principal Market for issuances of Common Stock in excess of such amount or (B) obtains a written opinion from outside counsel to the Company that such approval is not required, which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the holders of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes representing a majority of the principal amounts of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes (voting as a single class) then outstanding. Until such approval or written opinion is obtained, no purchaser of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement (the "PURCHASERS") shall be issued, upon conversion of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes, shares of Common Stock in an amount greater than the product of the Exchange Cap multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the principal amount of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes issued to such Purchaser pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement as of the date of such determination and the denominator of which is the aggregate principal amount of all the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes issued to the Purchasers pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement as of the date of such determination (with respect to each Purchaser, the "EXCHANGE CAP ALLOCATION"). In the event that any Purchaser shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such Purchaser's Notes or Separate Tranche Notes, the transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such Purchaser's Exchange Cap Allocation, and the restrictions of the prior sentence shall apply to such transferee with respect to the portion of the Exchange Cap Allocation allocated to such transferee. In the event that any holder of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes shall convert all of such holder's Notes or Separate Tranche Notes into a number of shares of Common Stock which, in the aggregate, is less than such holder's Exchange Cap Allocation, then the difference between such holder's Exchange Cap Allocation and the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued to such holder shall be allocated to the respective Exchange Cap Allocations of the remaining holders of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes on a pro rata basis in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes then held by each such holder. (4) RIGHTS UPON EVENT OF DEFAULT. (a) Event of Default. Each of the following events shall constitute a "EVENT OF DEFAULT": (i) the failure of the Registration Statement covering all Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) required to be registered pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement to be declared effective by the SEC on or prior to the date that is 180 days after the Issuance Date, or, while such Registration Statement is required 6
to be maintained effective pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, the effectiveness of such Registration Statement lapses for any reason (including, without limitation, the issuance of a stop order) or is unavailable to any holder of the Notes for sale of all of such holder's Registrable Securities in accordance with the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, and such lapse or unavailability continues for a period of five consecutive Business Days or for more than an aggregate of 20 Business Days in any 365-day period; (ii) the suspension from trading on the Principal Market for a period of three consecutive Business Days or for more than an aggregate of three Business Days in any 30-day Trading Day period or the delisting of the Common Stock from the Principal Market; (iii) the Company's (A) failure to cure a Conversion Failure by delivery of the required number of shares of Common Stock or a new Note (in accordance with section 18(d)), as applicable, within 10 days after the receipt by the Company of a Conversion Notice or (B) notice, written or oral, to any holder of the Notes, including by way of public announcement or through any of its agents, at any time, of its intention not to comply with a request for conversion of any Notes into shares of Common Stock that is tendered in accordance with the provisions of the Notes; (iv) the Company's failure to pay to the Holder any amount of Principal, Interest, Late Charges or other amounts when and as due under this Note, the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement or any other agreement, document, certificate or other instrument delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby to which the Holder is a party; (v) any default under, redemption of or acceleration prior to maturity of any Indebtedness (as defined in Section 3(r) of the Securities Purchase Agreement) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 3(a) of the Securities Purchase Agreement) other than NRG (as defined below) (including, without limitation, the Other Notes) of at least $50,000,000; (vi) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than NRG (as defined below), pursuant to or within the meaning of Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar Federal or state law for the relief of debtors (collectively, "BANKRUPTCY LAW"), (A) commences a voluntary case, (B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case, (C) consents to the appointment of a receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator or similar official (a "CUSTODIAN"), (D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors or (E) admits in writing that it is generally unable to pay its debts as they become due; (vii) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that (A) is for relief against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than NRG (as defined below) in an involuntary case, (B) appoints a Custodian of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than NRG (as defined below) or (C) orders the liquidation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than NRG (as defined below); or 7
(viii) the Company breaches any representation, warranty, covenant (other than any covenant to deliver the NRG Opinion) or other term or condition of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement, this Note or any other agreement, document, certificate or other instrument delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby and hereby to which the Holder is a party, except, in the case of a breach of a covenant which is curable, only if such breach continues for a period of at least 10 consecutive days. (b) Redemption Right. Promptly after the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to this Note or the Other Notes, the Company shall deliver written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier (a "EVENT OF DEFAULT NOTICE") to the Holder. At any time after the earlier of the Holder's receipt of an Event of Default Notice and the Holder becoming aware of an Event of Default, the Holder may require the Company to redeem all or any portion of this Note by delivering written notice thereof (the "EVENT OF DEFAULT REDEMPTION NOTICE") to the Company, which Event of Default Redemption Notice shall indicate the portion of this Note the Holder is electing to redeem. Each portion of this Note subject to redemption by the Company pursuant to this Section 4(b) shall be redeemed by the Company at a price equal to the greater of (i) the product of (x) the Conversion Amount and (y) the quotient determined by dividing (A) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock immediately prior to such Event of Default by (B) the Conversion Price and (ii) the product of (x) the Conversion Amount and (y) the Redemption Premium (the "EVENT OF DEFAULT REDEMPTION PRICE"). Redemptions required by this Section 4(b) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 10. (5) RIGHTS UPON CHANGE OF CONTROL. (a) Change of Control. Each of the following events shall constitute a "CHANGE OF CONTROL": (i) the consolidation, merger or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization or recapitalization) of the Company with or into another Person in which holders of the Company's voting power immediately prior to the transaction cease after the transaction to hold, directly or indirectly, a majority of the voting power of the surviving entity or entities or the voting power necessary to elect a majority of the members of the board of directors (or their equivalent if other than a corporation) of such entity or entities; (ii) the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Company's assets; or (iii) a purchase, tender or exchange offer made to and accepted by the holders of more than the 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. (b) Assumption. Prior to the consummation of any Change of Control, the Company will secure from any Person purchasing the Company's assets or Common Stock or any successor resulting from such Change of Control (in each case, an "ACQUIRING ENTITY") a written agreement (in form and substance satisfactory to the holders of Notes representing a 8
majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding) to deliver to each holder of Notes in exchange for such Notes, a security of the Acquiring Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to the Notes, including, without limitation, having a principal amount and interest rate equal to the principal amounts and the interest rates of the Notes held by such holder, and satisfactory to the holders of Notes representing a majority of the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. In the event that an Acquiring Entity is directly or indirectly controlled by a company or entity whose common stock or similar equity interest is listed, designated or quoted on a securities exchange or trading market, the holders of notes representing a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may elect to treat such Person as the Acquiring Entity for purposes of this Section 5(b). (c) Redemption Right. No sooner than 15 days nor later than 10 days prior to the consummation of a Change of Control, but not prior to the public announcement of such Change of Control, the Company shall deliver written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier to the Holder (a "CHANGE OF CONTROL NOTICE"). At any time on or after consummation of such Change of Control, the Holder may require the Company to redeem all or any portion of this Note by delivering written notice thereof ("CHANGE OF CONTROL REDEMPTION NOTICE" and, collectively with an Event of Default Redemption Notice, "REDEMPTION NOTICES" and, individually, each a "REDEMPTION NOTICE") to the Company, which Change of Control Redemption Notice shall indicate the Conversion Amount the Holder is electing to redeem. The portion of this Note subject to redemption pursuant to this Section 5(c) shall be redeemed by the Company at a price equal to the greater of (i) the product of (x) the Conversion Amount and (y) the quotient determined by dividing (A) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock immediately following the public announcement of such proposed Change of Control by (B) the Conversion Price and (ii) 115% of the Conversion Amount (the "CHANGE OF CONTROL REDEMPTION PRICE" and, together with the Event of Default Redemption Price, the "REDEMPTION PRICE"). Redemptions required by this Section 5(c) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 and shall have priority to payments to other shareholders in connection with a Change of Control. (6) RIGHTS UPON ISSUANCE OF PURCHASE RIGHTS AND OTHER CORPORATE EVENTS. (a) Purchase Rights. If at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of Common Stock (the "PURCHASE RIGHTS"), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of this Note) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights. 9
(b) Other Corporate Events. Prior to the consummation of any recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation, merger or other business combination (other than a Change of Control) pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock (a "CORPORATE EVENT"), the Company shall make appropriate provision to insure that the Holder will thereafter have the right to receive upon a conversion of this Note, (i) in addition to the shares of Common Stock receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets to which the Holder would have been entitled with respect to such shares of Common Stock had such shares of Common Stock been held by the Holder upon the consummation of such Corporate Event or (ii) in lieu of the shares of Common Stock otherwise receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets received by the holders of Common Stock in connection with the consummation of such Corporate Event in such amounts as the Holder would have been entitled to receive had this Note initially been issued with conversion rights for the form of such consideration (as opposed to shares of Common Stock) at a conversion rate for such consideration commensurate with the Conversion Rate. Provision made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be in a form and substance satisfactory to the holders of Notes representing a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. (7) RIGHTS UPON ISSUANCE OF OTHER SECURITIES. (a) Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Issuance of Common Stock. If and whenever on or after the Issuance Date, the Company issues or sells, or in accordance with this Section 7(a) is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of Common Stock (including the issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock owned or held by or for the account of the Company, but excluding shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold by the Company (I) in connection with the Xcel Energy Direct Purchase Plan or any employee benefit plan which has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, pursuant to which the Company's securities may be issued to any employee, officer or director for services provided to the Company or its Subsidiaries (each, an "APPROVED STOCK PLAN") or (II) upon conversion of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes) for a consideration per share less than the higher of the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the date of such issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale and the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale (such higher price is referred to herein as the "APPLICABLE PRICE"), then immediately after such issue or sale (subject to Section 7(a)(vi)), the Conversion Price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to the product of (x) the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale or deemed issuance or sale and (y) the quotient determined by dividing (1) the sum of the product of the Applicable Price and the number of shares of Common Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale or deemed issue or sale and the consideration, if any, received by the Company upon such issue or sale, by (2) the product of the Applicable Price multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately after such issue or sale or deemed issue or sale. For purposes of determining the adjusted Conversion Price under this Section 7(a), the following shall be applicable: (i) Issuance of Options. If the Company in any manner grants or sells any Options and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the 10
exercise of any such Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of such Option is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the granting or sale of such Option for such price per share. For purposes of this Section 7(a)(i), the "lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of such Option" shall be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon granting or sale of the Option, upon exercise of the Option and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon exercise of such Option. No further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock or of such Convertible Securities upon the exercise of such Options or upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities. If the Company issues or sells any Options which are Variable Securities, no adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made pursuant to this Section 7(a), and no shares of Common Stock shall be deemed outstanding with respect to such Variable Securities, as a result of the issuance of such Variable Securities until the actual issuance of Common Stock or Convertible Securities upon exercise of such Variable Securities, except to the extent such Variable Security also includes as a component of the exercise price a price which does not vary with the market price of the Common Stock. (ii) Issuance of Convertible Securities. If the Company in any manner issues or sells any Convertible Securities and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion, exercise or exchange thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the issuance of sale of such Convertible Securities for such price per share. For the purposes of this Section 7(a)(ii), the "price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion, exercise or exchange" shall be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the issuance or sale of the Convertible Security and upon the conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Security. No further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities, and if any such issue or sale of such Convertible Securities is made upon exercise of any Options for which adjustment of the Conversion Price had been or are to be made pursuant to other provisions of this Section 7(a), no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made by reason of such issue or sale. If the Company issues or sells any Convertible Securities which are Variable Securities, no adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made pursuant to this Section 7(a), and no shares of Common Stock shall be deemed outstanding with respect to such Variable Security, as a result of the issuance of such Variable Securities until the actual issuance of Common Stock upon exercise of such Variable Securities, except to the extent such Variable Security also includes as a component of the conversion, exercise or exchange price a price which does not vary with the market price of the Common Stock. 11
(iii) Change in Option Price or Rate of Conversion. If the purchase price provided for in any Options, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issue, conversion or exchange of any Convertible Securities, or the rate at which any Convertible Securities are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock changes at any time, the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such change shall be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been in effect at such time had such Options or Convertible Securities provided for such changed purchase price, additional consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold. For purposes of this Section 7(a)(iii), if the terms of any Option or Convertible Security that was outstanding as of the Issuance Date are changed in the manner described in the immediately preceding sentence, then such Option or Convertible Security and the Common Stock deemed issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such change. No adjustment shall be made if such adjustment would result in an increase of the Conversion Price then in effect. (iv) Calculation of Consideration Received. In case any Option is issued in connection with the issue or sale of other securities of the Company, together comprising one integrated transaction in which no specific consideration is allocated to such Options by the parties thereto, the Options will be deemed to have been issued for a consideration of $.01. If any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor will be deemed to be the net amount received by the Company therefor. If any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the Company will be the fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of securities, in which case the amount of consideration received by the Company will be the Closing Sale Price of such securities on the date of receipt. If any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the Company is the surviving entity, the amount of consideration therefor will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to such Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, as the case may be. The fair value of any consideration other than cash or securities will be determined jointly by the Company and the holders of Notes representing a majority of the principal amounts of the Notes then outstanding. If such parties are unable to reach agreement within ten days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the "VALUATION EVENT"), the fair value of such consideration will be determined within five Business Days after the tenth day following the Valuation Event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly selected by the Company and the holders of Notes representing a majority of the principal amounts of the Notes then outstanding. The determination of such appraiser shall be deemed binding upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the Company. 12
(v) Record Date. If the Company takes a record of the holders of Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (A) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in Common Stock, Options or in Convertible Securities or (B) to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date will be deemed to be the date of the issue or sale of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. (vi) Common Stock Deemed Outstanding. "COMMON STOCK DEEMED OUTSTANDING" means, at any given time, the number of shares of Common Stock actually outstanding at such time, plus the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be outstanding pursuant to Sections 7(a)(i) and 7(a)(ii) hereof regardless of whether the Options or Convertible Securities are actually exercisable at such time, but excluding any shares of Common Stock owned or held by or for the account of the Company or issuable upon conversion of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes. (vii) Delayed Adjustment. In addition to the foregoing provisions of this Section 7(a), the Weighted Average Price, Closing Sales Price and Closing Bid Price shall be subject to adjustment, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, for any days during any measuring period, including, without limitation, the Tranche A Pricing Period, used herein that occur prior to any of the aforementioned events if such events occur prior to the end of such measuring period. (b) Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock. If the Company at any time subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. If the Company at any time combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased. (c) Other Events. If any event occurs of the type contemplated by the provisions of this Section 7 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then the Company's Board of Directors will make an appropriate adjustment in the Conversion Price so as to protect the rights of the Holder under this Note; provided that no such adjustment will increase the Conversion Price as otherwise determined pursuant to this Section 7. (8) NONCIRCUMVENTION. The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Articles of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of, or enter into any agreement which by its terms restricts or otherwise impairs the 13
Company's performance of the terms of, this Note or any of the other Transaction Documents (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement), and will at all times in good faith carry out all of the provisions of this Note and take all action as may be required to protect the rights of the Holder of this Note. (9) RESERVATION OF AUTHORIZED SHARES. (a) Reservation. The Company shall initially reserve out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock a number of shares of Common Stock for each of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes equal to 115% of the Conversion Rate with respect to the Conversion Amount of each such Note and Separate Tranche Note. Thereafter, the Company shall, so long as any of the Notes or Separate Tranche Notes are outstanding, take all action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Notes and Separate Tranche Note, at least 100% of the number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion of all of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes then outstanding; provided that at no time shall the number of shares of Common Stock so reserved be less than the number of shares required to be reserved by the previous sentence (without regard to any limitations on conversions) (the "REQUIRED RESERVE AMOUNT"). The initial number of shares of Common Stock reserved for conversions of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Note and each increase in the number of shares so reserved shall be allocated pro rata among the holders of the Notes and Separate Tranche Note based on the principal amount of the Notes and Separate Tranche Notes held by each holder at the time of Issuance Date or increase in the number of reserved shares, as the case may be (the "AUTHORIZED SHARE ALLOCATION"). In the event that a holder shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such holder's Notes, each transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such holder's Authorized Share Allocation. Any shares of Common Stock reserved and allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Notes shall be allocated to the remaining holders of Notes, pro rata based on the principal amount of the Notes then held by such holders. (b) Insufficient Authorized Shares. If at any time while any of the Notes or Separate Tranche Note remain outstanding the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved shares of Common Stock to satisfy its obligation to reserve for issuance upon conversion of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes at least a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Required Reserve Amount (an "AUTHORIZED SHARE FAILURE"), then the Company shall immediately take all action necessary to increase the Company's authorized shares of Common Stock to an amount sufficient to allow the Company to reserve the Required Reserve Amount for the Notes and Separate Tranche Note then outstanding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the date of the occurrence of an Authorized Share Failure, but in no event later than 60 days after the occurrence of such Authorized Share Failure, the Company shall hold a meeting of its shareholders for the approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock. In connection with such meeting, the Company shall provide each shareholder with a proxy statement and shall use its best efforts to solicit its shareholders' approval of such increase in authorized shares of Common Stock and to cause its board of directors to recommend to the shareholders that they approve such proposal. 14
(10) REDEMPTION. (a) Mechanics. In the event that the Holder has sent a Redemption Notice to the Company pursuant to Section 4(b) or Section 5(c), the Holder shall promptly submit this Note to the Company. The Company shall deliver the applicable Event of Default Redemption Price to the Holder within five Business Days after the Company's receipt of the Holder's Event of Default Redemption Notice and thereafter the Holder shall promptly deliver this Note to the Company. If the Holder has submitted a Change of Control Redemption Notice in accordance with Section 5(c), the Company shall deliver the applicable Change of Control Redemption Price to the Holder concurrently with the consummation of such Change of Control if such notice is received prior to the consummation of such Change of Control and within five Business Days after the Company's receipt of such notice otherwise. In the event of a redemption of less than all of the Conversion Amount of this Note, the Company shall promptly cause to be issued and delivered to the Holder a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) representing the outstanding Principal which has not been redeemed. In the event that the Company does not pay the Redemption Price to the Holder within the time period required above in this Section 10(a) at any time thereafter and until the Company pays such unpaid Redemption Price in full, the Holder shall have the option to, in lieu of redemption, require the Company to promptly return to the Holder all or any portion of this Note representing the Conversion Amount that was submitted for redemption and for which the applicable Redemption Price (together with any Late Charges thereon) has not been paid. Upon the Company's receipt of such notice, (x) the Redemption Notice shall be null and void with respect to such Conversion Amount, (y) the Company shall immediately return this Note, or issue a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) to the Holder representing such Conversion Amount and (z) the Conversion Price of this Note or such new Notes shall be adjusted to the lesser of (A) the Conversion Price as in effect on the date on which the Redemption Notice is voided and (B) the lowest Closing Bid Price during the period beginning on and including the date on which the Redemption Notice is delivered to the Company and ending on and including the date on which the Redemption Notice is voided. The Holder's delivery of a notice voiding a Redemption Notice and exercise of its rights following such notice shall not affect the Company's obligations to make any payments of Late Charges which have accrued prior to the date of such notice with respect to the Conversion Amount subject to such notice. (b) Redemption by Other Holders. Upon the Company's receipt of notice from any of the holders of the Other Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes for redemption or repayment as a result of an event or occurrence substantially similar to the events or occurrences described in Section 4(b) or Section 5(c) (each an "OTHER REDEMPTION NOTICE"), the Company shall immediately forward to the Holder by facsimile a copy of such notice. If the Company receives a Redemption Notice and one or more Other Redemption Notices during the seven Business Day period beginning on and including the date which is three Business Days prior to the Company's receipt of the Holder's Redemption Notice and ending on and including the date which is three Business Days after the Company's receipt of the Holder's Redemption Notice and the Company is unable to redeem all principal, interest and other amounts designated in such Redemption Notice and such Other Redemption Notices received during such seven Business Day period, then the Company shall redeem a pro rata amount from each holder of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes (including the Holder) based on the principal amount of 15
the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes submitted for redemption pursuant to such Redemption Notice and such Other Redemption Notices received by the Company during such seven Business Day period. (c) Redemption at the Option of the Company. (i) Except as provided in this Section 10(c) or in connection with the satisfaction by the Company of its obligations to redeem the Notes under Sections 4(b) and 5(c) hereof, without the prior written consent of the Holder the Company shall not have the right to prepay, redeem, repurchase, defease or otherwise retire any Note prior to the Maturity Date. (ii) Provided the Company has consummated a Qualified 144A Offering at any time during the Company Optional Redemption Period, the Company may deliver an irrevocable written notice to the Holder and the Transfer Agent (the "COMPANY OPTIONAL REDEMPTION NOTICE") within one (1) Business Day after consummation of the Qualified 144A Offering, indicating that the Company has elected to redeem, and is requiring the Holder to submit for redemption, in whole but not in part, the outstanding Principal of this Note plus accrued Interest thereon for the Company Optional Redemption Consideration (a "COMPANY OPTIONAL REDEMPTION"). The Company Optional Redemption Notice shall be sent by facsimile and overnight courier to the Holder and shall indicate (x) the date fixed for redemption, which shall be five (5) Business Days after the expiration of the Company Optional Redemption Period (the "COMPANY OPTIONAL REDEMPTION DATE") and (y) the place or places where this Note is to be surrendered for payment of the Company Optional Redemption Consideration. If the Company has elected a Company Optional Redemption, the Company shall on the Company Optional Redemption Date (A) deliver the Non-Cash Optional Redemption Consideration to the Holder at the Holder's address and (B) pay to the Holder the Cash Optional Redemption Consideration, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by such Holder. (11) RESTRICTION ON REDEMPTION. Until all of the Notes have been converted, redeemed or otherwise satisfied in accordance with their terms, the Company shall not, directly or indirectly, redeem its capital stock without the prior express written consent of the holders of Notes representing at least two-thirds of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. (12) SUBORDINATION; ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS. Payments of Principal and Interest and other payments due under this Note shall rank pari passu in right of payment with all (and shall not be subordinated to any) unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company and will be senior in right of payment to all subordinated indebtedness of the Company. (13) COVENANTS. (a) Indebtedness. The Company shall not create, incur, assume, guarantee or suffer to exist, or otherwise become or remain liable with respect to, any Indebtedness other than Permitted Indebtedness and Subordinated Indebtedness. "Subordinated Indebtedness" shall mean Indebtedness that is unsecured and subordinated in right of payment to 16
the Notes and other obligations owing to the Holders in accordance with a subordination agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Holders. "Permitted Indebtedness" shall mean any Indebtedness that is unsecured and is not senior in right of payment to the Notes and is otherwise on terms that are no more favorable to the holders thereof than the terms of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes unless such more favorable terms are offered to the Holders. (b) Liens. The Company shall not create, incur, assume or suffer to exist, or permit any of its Subsidiaries (other than NRG Energy Inc. or its subsidiaries (collectively, "NRG")) to create, incur, assume or suffer to exist, any Lien upon or with respect to any of its properties, whether now owned or hereafter acquired; sign or suffer to exist any security agreement authorizing any secured party thereunder to file a Uniform Commercial Code financing statement (or the equivalent thereof) as notice of a Lien on any property of the Company or its Subsidiaries; sell any of its property or assets subject to an understanding or agreement, contingent or otherwise, to repurchase such property or assets (including sales of accounts receivable) with recourse to it or any of its Subsidiaries or assign or otherwise transfer, or permit any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Existing Utility Subsidiaries (as defined in the Bank Facility)) to assign or otherwise transfer, any account or other right to receive income; other than, as to all of the above, Permitted Liens. As used herein, "Permitted Liens" shall have the meaning of that term as defined in the Five-Year Credit Agreement, dated as of November 10, 2000, among the Company and the banks listed therein (as the same maybe amended from time to time, the "BANK FACILITY"). As used herein, "Liens" means any mortgage, deed of trust, pledge, lien (statutory or otherwise), security interest, charge or other encumbrance or security or preferential arrangement of any nature, including, without limitation, any conditional sale or title retention arrangement, any capitalized lease and any assignment, deposit arrangement or financing lease intended as, or having the effect of, security. (c) Transactions With Affiliates. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, effect any transaction with any Affiliate (as defined in the Bank Facility) that is (a) outside the ordinary course of business or (b) on a basis less favorable than would at the time be obtainable for a comparable transaction in arms-length dealing with an unrelated third party, provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, no loan, payment or other form of contribution shall be made to NRG unless it is in an amount not in excess of (i) $300 Million payable pursuant to the Support Agreement and Capital Subscription Agreement, dated as of May 29, 2002, by and between the Company and NRG Energy Inc. and (ii) $250 Million in respect of guarantee obligations relating to the power marketing business of NRG; provided further that with respect to any payment permitted pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Company shall, in the context of a restructuring of NRG, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain a full release of all obligations and liabilities of the Company relating to NRG. (d) Leverage Ratio. The Company shall not permit the Leverage Ratio set forth in the Bank Facility to be exceeded. (e) Restrictive Agreements. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Significant Subsidiary (as defined in the Bank Facility) other than NRG to, enter into any agreement after the date of this Note that imposes any restriction on the ability of such Significant Subsidiary to make payments, directly or indirectly, to its shareholders by way of 17
dividends, advances, repayment of loans or intercompany charges, expenses or accruals or other returns on investments that is more restrictive than any such restriction applicable to such Significant Subsidiary on the Issuance Date. (f) Scope of Business. The Company shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary to, engage only in energy-related business, functionally related businesses (as interpreted under PUHCA, as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement) or such other businesses as maybe permitted pursuant to an order issued by the SEC pursuant to PUHCA. (14) VOTING RIGHTS. The Holder shall have no voting rights as the holder of this Note, except as required by law, including but not limited to the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, and as expressly provided in this Note. (15) PARTICIPATION. The Holder, as the holder of this Note, shall be entitled to (i) all extraordinary or special dividends paid and distributions made to the holders of Common Stock to the same extent as if the Holder had converted this Note into Common Stock (without regard to any limitations on conversion herein or elsewhere) and had held such shares of Common Stock on the record date for such dividends and distributions and (ii) regular cash dividends and distributions paid to the holders of the Common Stock only with respect to that portion of such dividends that exceeds $0.1875 per share of Common Stock in any calendar quarter (subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and other similar transactions after the Issuance Date). Payments under the preceding sentence shall be made concurrently with the dividend or distribution to the holders of Common Stock. (16) VOTE TO ISSUE, OR CHANGE THE TERMS OF, NOTES. The affirmative vote at a meeting duly called for such purpose or the written consent without a meeting, of the holders of Notes representing not less than two-thirds of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, shall be required for any change or amendment to this Note or the Other Notes. (17) TRANSFER. This Note may be offered, sold, assigned or transferred by the Holder without the consent of the Company, subject only to the provisions of Section 2(f) of the Securities Purchase Agreement. (18) REISSUANCE OF THIS NOTE. (a) Transfer. If this Note is to be transferred, the Holder shall surrender this Note to the Company, whereupon the Company will forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of the Holder a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)), registered as the Holder may request, representing the outstanding Principal being transferred by the Holder and, if less then the entire outstanding Principal is being transferred, a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) to the Holder representing the outstanding Principal not being transferred. The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this Note, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of Section 3(c)(iii) and this Section 18(a), following conversion or redemption of any portion of this Note, the outstanding Principal represented by this Note may be less than the Principal stated on the face of this Note. 18
(b) Lost, Stolen or Mutilated Note. Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Note, and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of any indemnification undertaking by the Holder to the Company in customary form and, in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of this Note, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Holder a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) representing the outstanding Principal. (c) Note Exchangeable for Different Denominations. This Note is exchangeable, upon the surrender hereof by the Holder at the principal office of the Company, for a new Note or Notes (in accordance with Section 18(d) and in principal amounts of at least $100,000) representing in the aggregate the outstanding Principal of this Note, and each such new Note will represent such portion of such outstanding Principal as is designated by the Holder at the time of such surrender. (d) Issuance of New Notes. Whenever the Company is required to issue a new Note pursuant to the terms of this Note, such new Note (i) shall be of like tenor with this Note, (ii) shall represent, as indicated on the face of such new Note, the Principal remaining outstanding (or in the case of a new Note being issued pursuant to Section 18(a) or Section 18(c), the Principal designated by the Holder which, when added to the principal represented by the other new Notes issued in connection with such issuance, does not exceed the Principal remaining outstanding under this Note immediately prior to such issuance of new Notes), (iii) shall have an issuance date, as indicated on the face of such new Note which is the same as the Issuance Date of this Note, (iv) shall have the same rights and conditions as this Note, and (v) shall represent accrued Interest and Late Charges on the Principal and Interest of this Note, from the Issuance Date. (19) REMEDIES, CHARACTERIZATIONS, OTHER OBLIGATIONS, BREACHES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. The remedies provided in this Note shall be cumulative and in addition to all other remedies available under this Note, the Securities Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement, at law or in equity (including a decree of specific performance and/or other injunctive relief), and nothing herein shall limit the Holder's right to pursue actual and consequential damages for any failure by the Company to comply with the terms of this Note. Amounts set forth or provided for herein with respect to payments, conversion and the like (and the computation thereof) shall be the amounts to be received by the Holder and shall not, except as expressly provided herein, be subject to any other obligation of the Company (or the performance thereof). The Company acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to the Holder and that the remedy at law for any such breach may be inadequate. The Company therefore agrees that, in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, the Holder shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies, to an injunction restraining any breach, without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required. (20) PAYMENT OF COLLECTION, ENFORCEMENT AND OTHER COSTS. If (a) this Note is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection or enforcement or is 19
collected or enforced through any legal proceeding or the Holder otherwise takes action to collect amounts due under this Note or to enforce the provisions of this Note or (b) there occurs any bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership of the Company or other proceedings affecting Company creditors' rights and involving a claim under this Note, then the Company shall pay the costs incurred by the Holder for such collection, enforcement or action or in connection with such bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership or other proceeding, including but not limited to attorneys fees and disbursements. (21) CONSTRUCTION; HEADINGS. This Note shall be deemed to be jointly drafted by the Company and all the Purchasers and shall not be construed against any person as the drafter hereof. The headings of this Note are for convenience of reference and shall not form part of, or affect the interpretation of, this Note. (22) FAILURE OR INDULGENCE NOT WAIVER. No failure or delay on the part of the Holder in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privilege. (23) DISPUTE RESOLUTION. In the case of a dispute as to the determination of the Redemption Price or the arithmetic calculation of the Conversion Rate or the Redemption Price or any other calculation hereunder, the Company shall submit the disputed determinations or arithmetic calculations via facsimile within one Business Day of receipt of the Conversion Notice or Redemption Notice giving rise to such dispute, as the case may be, to the Holder. If the Holder and the Company are unable to agree upon such determination or calculation of the Conversion Rate within one Business Day of such disputed determination or arithmetic calculation being submitted to the Holder, then the Company shall, within one Business Day submit via facsimile (a) the disputed determination of the Weighted Average Price, the Closing Bid Price or the Closing Sale Price or any other calculation hereunder to an independent, reputable investment bank selected by the Company and approved by the Holder or (b) the disputed arithmetic calculation of the Conversion Rate or the Redemption Price to the Company's independent, outside accountant. The Company, at the Company's expense, shall cause the investment bank or the accountant, as the case may be, to perform the determinations or calculations and notify the Company and the Holder of the results no later than five Business Days from the time it receives the disputed determinations or calculations. Such investment bank's or accountant's determination or calculation, as the case may be, shall be binding upon all parties absent demonstrable error. (24) NOTICES; PAYMENTS. (a) Notices. Whenever notice is required to be given under this Note, unless otherwise provided herein, such notice shall be given in accordance with Section 9(f) of the Securities Purchase Agreement. The Company shall provide the Holder with prompt written notice of all actions taken pursuant to this Note, including in reasonable detail a description of such action and the reason therefore. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company will give written notice to the Holder (i) immediately upon any adjustment of the Conversion Price, setting forth in reasonable detail, and certifying, the calculation of such 20
adjustment and (ii) at least twenty days prior to the date on which the Company closes its books or takes a record (A) with respect to any dividend or distribution upon the Common Stock, (B) with respect to any grants, issues or sales of any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to holders of Common Stock or (C) for determining rights to vote with respect to any Change of Control, dissolution or liquidation, provided in each case that such information shall be made known to the public prior to or in conjunction with such notice being provided to such holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Section 4(j) of the Securities Purchase Agreement shall apply to all notices given pursuant to this Note. (b) Payments. Whenever any payment of cash is to be made by the Company to any Person pursuant to this Note, such payment shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America by a check drawn on the account of the Company and sent via overnight courier service to such Person at such address as previously provided to the Company in writing (which address, in the case of each of the Purchasers (as defined in Section 3(d)(ii)), shall initially be as set forth on the Schedule of Buyers attached to the Securities Purchase Agreement); provided that the Holder may elect to receive a payment of cash via wire transfer of immediately available funds by providing the Company with prior written notice setting out such request and the Holder's wire transfer instructions. Whenever any amount expressed to be due by the terms of this Note is due on any day which is not a Business Day, the same shall instead be due on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day and, in the case of any Interest Date which is not the date on which this Note is paid in full, the extension of the due date thereof shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining the amount of Interest due on such date.

In the event of a dispute as to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable to the Holder in connection with a conversion of this Note, the Company shall issue to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock not in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 23. (d) Limitations on Conversions. (i) Beneficial Ownership. The Company shall not effect any conversion of this Note, and the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to convert any portion of this Note pursuant to Section 3(a), to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion, the Holder (together with the Holder's affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 5.0% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note with respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (A) conversion of the remaining, nonconverted portion of this Note beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its affiliates and (B) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any Other Notes, Separate Tranche Notes or warrants) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its affiliates. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 3(d)(i), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. For purposes of this Section 3(d)(i), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (x) the Company's most recent Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (z) any other notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of the Holder, the Company shall within one Business Day confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of 5
Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Note, by the Holder or its affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. (ii) Principal Market Regulation. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Note if the issuance of such shares of Common Stock would exceed that number of shares of Common Stock which the Company may issue pursuant to the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes without breaching the Company's obligations under the rules or regulations of the Principal Market (the "EXCHANGE CAP"), except that such limitation shall not apply in the event that the Company (A) obtains the approval of its shareholders as required by the applicable rules of the Principal Market for issuances of Common Stock in excess of such amount or (B) obtains a written opinion from outside counsel to the Company that such approval is not required, which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the holders of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes representing a majority of the principal amounts of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes (voting as a single class) then outstanding. Until such approval or written opinion is obtained, no purchaser of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement (the "PURCHASERS") shall be issued, upon conversion of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes, shares of Common Stock in an amount greater than the product of the Exchange Cap multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the principal amount of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes issued to such Purchaser pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement as of the date of such determination and the denominator of which is the aggregate principal amount of all the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes issued to the Purchasers pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement as of the date of such determination (with respect to each Purchaser, the "EXCHANGE CAP ALLOCATION"). In the event that any Purchaser shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such Purchaser's Notes or Separate Tranche Notes, the transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such Purchaser's Exchange Cap Allocation, and the restrictions of the prior sentence shall apply to such transferee with respect to the portion of the Exchange Cap Allocation allocated to such transferee. In the event that any holder of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes shall convert all of such holder's Notes or Separate Tranche Notes into a number of shares of Common Stock which, in the aggregate, is less than such holder's Exchange Cap Allocation, then the difference between such holder's Exchange Cap Allocation and the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued to such holder shall be allocated to the respective Exchange Cap Allocations of the remaining holders of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes on a pro rata basis in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes then held by each such holder. (4) RIGHTS UPON EVENT OF DEFAULT. (a) Event of Default. Each of the following events shall constitute a "EVENT OF DEFAULT": (i) the failure of the Registration Statement covering all Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) required to be registered pursuant to the 6
Registration Rights Agreement to be declared effective by the SEC on or prior to the date that is 180 days after the Issuance Date, or, while such Registration Statement is required to be maintained effective pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, the effectiveness of such Registration Statement lapses for any reason (including, without limitation, the issuance of a stop order) or is unavailable to any holder of the Notes for sale of all of such holder's Registrable Securities in accordance with the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, and such lapse or unavailability continues for a period of five consecutive Business Days or for more than an aggregate of 20 Business Days in any 365-day period; (ii) the suspension from trading on the Principal Market for a period of three consecutive Business Days or for more than an aggregate of three Business Days in any 30-day Trading Day period or the delisting of the Common Stock from the Principal Market; (iii) the Company's (A) failure to cure a Conversion Failure by delivery of the required number of shares of Common Stock or a new Note (in accordance with section 18(d)), as applicable, within 10 days after the receipt by the Company of a Conversion Notice or (B) notice, written or oral, to any holder of the Notes, including by way of public announcement or through any of its agents, at any time, of its intention not to comply with a request for conversion of any Notes into shares of Common Stock that is tendered in accordance with the provisions of the Notes; (iv) the Company's failure to pay to the Holder any amount of Principal, Interest, Late Charges or other amounts when and as due under this Note, the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement or any other agreement, document, certificate or other instrument delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby to which the Holder is a party; (v) any default under, redemption of or acceleration prior to maturity of any Indebtedness (as defined in Section 3(r) of the Securities Purchase Agreement) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 3(a) of the Securities Purchase Agreement) other than NRG (as defined below) (including, without limitation, the Other Notes) of at least $50,000,000; (vi) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than NRG (as defined below), pursuant to or within the meaning of Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar Federal or state law for the relief of debtors (collectively, "BANKRUPTCY LAW"), (A) commences a voluntary case, (B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case, (C) consents to the appointment of a receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator or similar official (a "CUSTODIAN"), (D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors or (E) admits in writing that it is generally unable to pay its debts as they become due; (vii) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that (A) is for relief against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than NRG (as defined below) in an involuntary case, (B) appoints a Custodian of the Company or 7

(b) Redemption Right. Promptly after the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to this Note or the Other Notes, the Company shall deliver written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier (a "EVENT OF DEFAULT NOTICE") to the Holder. At any time after the earlier of the Holder's receipt of an Event of Default Notice and the Holder becoming aware of an Event of Default, the Holder may require the Company to redeem all or any portion of this Note by delivering written notice thereof (the "EVENT OF DEFAULT REDEMPTION NOTICE") to the Company, which Event of Default Redemption Notice shall indicate the portion of this Note the Holder is electing to redeem. Each portion of this Note subject to redemption by the Company pursuant to this Section 4(b) shall be redeemed by the Company at a price equal to the greater of (i) the product of (x) the Conversion Amount and (y) the quotient determined by dividing (A) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock immediately prior to such Event of Default by (B) the Conversion Price and (ii) the product of (x) the Conversion Amount and (y) the Redemption Premium (the "EVENT OF DEFAULT REDEMPTION PRICE"). Redemptions required by this Section 4(b) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 10. (5) RIGHTS UPON CHANGE OF CONTROL. (a) Change of Control. Each of the following events shall constitute a "CHANGE OF CONTROL": (i) the consolidation, merger or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization or recapitalization) of the Company with or into another Person in which holders of the Company's voting power immediately prior to the transaction cease after the transaction to hold, directly or indirectly, a majority of the voting power of the surviving entity or entities or the voting power necessary to elect a majority of the members of the board of directors (or their equivalent if other than a corporation) of such entity or entities; (ii) the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Company's assets; or (iii) a purchase, tender or exchange offer made to and accepted by the holders of more than the 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. (b) Assumption. Prior to the consummation of any Change of Control, the Company will secure from any Person purchasing the Company's assets or Common Stock 8
or any successor resulting from such Change of Control (in each case, an "ACQUIRING ENTITY") a written agreement (in form and substance satisfactory to the holders of Notes representing a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding) to deliver to each holder of Notes in exchange for such Notes, a security of the Acquiring Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to the Notes, including, without limitation, having a principal amount and interest rate equal to the principal amounts and the interest rates of the Notes held by such holder, and satisfactory to the holders of Notes representing a majority of the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. In the event that an Acquiring Entity is directly or indirectly controlled by a company or entity whose common stock or similar equity interest is listed, designated or quoted on a securities exchange or trading market, the holders of notes representing a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may elect to treat such Person as the Acquiring Entity for purposes of this Section 5(b). (c) Redemption Right. No sooner than 15 days nor later than 10 days prior to the consummation of a Change of Control, but not prior to the public announcement of such Change of Control, the Company shall deliver written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier to the Holder (a "CHANGE OF CONTROL NOTICE"). At any time on or after consummation of such Change of Control, the Holder may require the Company to redeem all or any portion of this Note by delivering written notice thereof ("CHANGE OF CONTROL REDEMPTION NOTICE" and, collectively with an Event of Default Redemption Notice, "REDEMPTION NOTICES" and, individually, each a "REDEMPTION NOTICE") to the Company, which Change of Control Redemption Notice shall indicate the Conversion Amount the Holder is electing to redeem. The portion of this Note subject to redemption pursuant to this Section 5(c) shall be redeemed by the Company at a price equal to the greater of (i) the product of (x) the Conversion Amount and (y) the quotient determined by dividing (A) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock immediately following the public announcement of such proposed Change of Control by (B) the Conversion Price and (ii) 115% of the Conversion Amount (the "CHANGE OF CONTROL REDEMPTION PRICE" and, together with the Event of Default Redemption Price, the "REDEMPTION PRICE"). Redemptions required by this Section 5(c) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 and shall have priority to payments to other shareholders in connection with a Change of Control. (6) RIGHTS UPON ISSUANCE OF PURCHASE RIGHTS AND OTHER CORPORATE EVENTS. (a) Purchase Rights. If at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of Common Stock (the "PURCHASE RIGHTS"), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of this Note) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights. 9
(b) Other Corporate Events. Prior to the consummation of any recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation, merger or other business combination (other than a Change of Control) pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock (a "CORPORATE EVENT"), the Company shall make appropriate provision to insure that the Holder will thereafter have the right to receive upon a conversion of this Note, (i) in addition to the shares of Common Stock receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets to which the Holder would have been entitled with respect to such shares of Common Stock had such shares of Common Stock been held by the Holder upon the consummation of such Corporate Event or (ii) in lieu of the shares of Common Stock otherwise receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets received by the holders of Common Stock in connection with the consummation of such Corporate Event in such amounts as the Holder would have been entitled to receive had this Note initially been issued with conversion rights for the form of such consideration (as opposed to shares of Common Stock) at a conversion rate for such consideration commensurate with the Conversion Rate. Provision made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be in a form and substance satisfactory to the holders of Notes representing a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. (7) RIGHTS UPON ISSUANCE OF OTHER SECURITIES. (a) Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Issuance of Common Stock. If and whenever on or after the Issuance Date, the Company issues or sells, or in accordance with this Section 7(a) is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of Common Stock (including the issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock owned or held by or for the account of the Company, but excluding shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold by the Company (I) in connection with the Xcel Energy Direct Purchase Plan or any employee benefit plan which has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, pursuant to which the Company's securities may be issued to any employee, officer or director for services provided to the Company or its Subsidiaries (each, an "APPROVED STOCK PLAN") or (II) upon conversion of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes) for a consideration per share less than the higher of the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the date of such issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale and the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale (such higher price is referred to herein as the "APPLICABLE PRICE"), then immediately after such issue or sale (subject to Section 7(a)(vi)), the Conversion Price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to the product of (x) the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale or deemed issuance or sale and (y) the quotient determined by dividing (1) the sum of the product of the Applicable Price and the number of shares of Common Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale or deemed issue or sale and the consideration, if any, received by the Company upon such issue or sale, by (2) the product of the Applicable Price multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately after such issue or sale or deemed issue or sale. For purposes of determining the adjusted Conversion Price under this Section 7(a), the following shall be applicable: 10
(i) Issuance of Options. If the Company in any manner grants or sells any Options and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of such Option is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the granting or sale of such Option for such price per share. For purposes of this Section 7(a)(i), the "lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of such Option" shall be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon granting or sale of the Option, upon exercise of the Option and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon exercise of such Option. No further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock or of such Convertible Securities upon the exercise of such Options or upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities. If the Company issues or sells any Options which are Variable Securities, no adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made pursuant to this Section 7(a), and no shares of Common Stock shall be deemed outstanding with respect to such Variable Securities, as a result of the issuance of such Variable Securities until the actual issuance of Common Stock or Convertible Securities upon exercise of such Variable Securities, except to the extent such Variable Security also includes as a component of the exercise price a price which does not vary with the market price of the Common Stock. (ii) Issuance of Convertible Securities. If the Company in any manner issues or sells any Convertible Securities and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion, exercise or exchange thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the issuance of sale of such Convertible Securities for such price per share. For the purposes of this Section 7(a)(ii), the "price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion, exercise or exchange" shall be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the issuance or sale of the Convertible Security and upon the conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Security. No further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities, and if any such issue or sale of such Convertible Securities is made upon exercise of any Options for which adjustment of the Conversion Price had been or are to be made pursuant to other provisions of this Section 7(a), no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made by reason of such issue or sale. If the Company issues or sells any Convertible Securities which are Variable Securities, no adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made pursuant to this Section 7(a), and no shares of Common Stock shall be deemed outstanding with respect to such Variable Security, as a result of the issuance of such Variable Securities until the actual issuance of Common Stock upon exercise of 11
such Variable Securities, except to the extent such Variable Security also includes as a component of the conversion, exercise or exchange price a price which does not vary with the market price of the Common Stock. (iii) Change in Option Price or Rate of Conversion. If the purchase price provided for in any Options, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issue, conversion or exchange of any Convertible Securities, or the rate at which any Convertible Securities are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock changes at any time, the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such change shall be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been in effect at such time had such Options or Convertible Securities provided for such changed purchase price, additional consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold. For purposes of this Section 7(a)(iii), if the terms of any Option or Convertible Security that was outstanding as of the Issuance Date are changed in the manner described in the immediately preceding sentence, then such Option or Convertible Security and the Common Stock deemed issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such change. No adjustment shall be made if such adjustment would result in an increase of the Conversion Price then in effect. (iv) Calculation of Consideration Received. In case any Option is issued in connection with the issue or sale of other securities of the Company, together comprising one integrated transaction in which no specific consideration is allocated to such Options by the parties thereto, the Options will be deemed to have been issued for a consideration of $.01. If any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor will be deemed to be the net amount received by the Company therefor. If any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the Company will be the fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of securities, in which case the amount of consideration received by the Company will be the Closing Sale Price of such securities on the date of receipt. If any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the Company is the surviving entity, the amount of consideration therefor will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to such Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, as the case may be. The fair value of any consideration other than cash or securities will be determined jointly by the Company and the holders of Notes representing a majority of the principal amounts of the Notes then outstanding. If such parties are unable to reach agreement within ten days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the "VALUATION EVENT"), the fair value of such consideration will be determined within five Business Days after the tenth day following the Valuation Event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly selected by the Company and the holders of Notes representing a majority of the principal amounts of the Notes then outstanding. The determination of such appraiser shall be deemed binding upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the Company. 12
(v) Record Date. If the Company takes a record of the holders of Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (A) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in Common Stock, Options or in Convertible Securities or (B) to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date will be deemed to be the date of the issue or sale of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. (vi) Common Stock Deemed Outstanding. "COMMON STOCK DEEMED OUTSTANDING" means, at any given time, the number of shares of Common Stock actually outstanding at such time, plus the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be outstanding pursuant to Sections 7(a)(i) and 7(a)(ii) hereof regardless of whether the Options or Convertible Securities are actually exercisable at such time, but excluding any shares of Common Stock owned or held by or for the account of the Company or issuable upon conversion of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes. (vii) Delayed Adjustment. In addition to the foregoing provisions of this Section 7(a), the Weighted Average Price, Closing Sales Price and Closing Bid Price shall be subject to adjustment, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, for any days during any measuring period, including, without limitation, the Tranche A Pricing Period, used herein that occur prior to any of the aforementioned events if such events occur prior to the end of such measuring period. (b) Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock. If the Company at any time subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. If the Company at any time combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased. (c) Other Events. If any event occurs of the type contemplated by the provisions of this Section 7 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then the Company's Board of Directors will make an appropriate adjustment in the Conversion Price so as to protect the rights of the Holder under this Note; provided that no such adjustment will increase the Conversion Price as otherwise determined pursuant to this Section 7. (8) NONCIRCUMVENTION. The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Articles of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or 13
any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of, or enter into any agreement which by its terms restricts or otherwise impairs the Company's performance of the terms of, this Note or any of the other Transaction Documents (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement), and will at all times in good faith carry out all of the provisions of this Note and take all action as may be required to protect the rights of the Holder of this Note. (9) RESERVATION OF AUTHORIZED SHARES. (a) Reservation. The Company shall initially reserve out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock a number of shares of Common Stock for each of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes equal to 115% of the Conversion Rate with respect to the Conversion Amount of each such Note and Separate Tranche Note. Thereafter, the Company shall, so long as any of the Notes or Separate Tranche Notes are outstanding, take all action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Notes and Separate Tranche Note, at least 100% of the number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion of all of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes then outstanding; provided that at no time shall the number of shares of Common Stock so reserved be less than the number of shares required to be reserved by the previous sentence (without regard to any limitations on conversions) (the "REQUIRED RESERVE AMOUNT"). The initial number of shares of Common Stock reserved for conversions of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Note and each increase in the number of shares so reserved shall be allocated pro rata among the holders of the Notes and Separate Tranche Note based on the principal amount of the Notes and Separate Tranche Notes held by each holder at the time of Issuance Date or increase in the number of reserved shares, as the case may be (the "AUTHORIZED SHARE ALLOCATION"). In the event that a holder shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such holder's Notes, each transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such holder's Authorized Share Allocation. Any shares of Common Stock reserved and allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Notes shall be allocated to the remaining holders of Notes, pro rata based on the principal amount of the Notes then held by such holders. (b) Insufficient Authorized Shares. If at any time while any of the Notes or Separate Tranche Note remain outstanding the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved shares of Common Stock to satisfy its obligation to reserve for issuance upon conversion of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes at least a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Required Reserve Amount (an "AUTHORIZED SHARE FAILURE"), then the Company shall immediately take all action necessary to increase the Company's authorized shares of Common Stock to an amount sufficient to allow the Company to reserve the Required Reserve Amount for the Notes and Separate Tranche Note then outstanding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the date of the occurrence of an Authorized Share Failure, but in no event later than 60 days after the occurrence of such Authorized Share Failure, the Company shall hold a meeting of its shareholders for the approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock. In connection with such meeting, the Company shall provide each shareholder with a proxy statement and shall use its best efforts to solicit its shareholders' approval of such increase in authorized shares of Common Stock and to cause its board of directors to recommend to the shareholders that they approve such proposal. 14
(10) REDEMPTION. (a) Mechanics. In the event that the Holder has sent a Redemption Notice to the Company pursuant to Section 4(b) or Section 5(c), the Holder shall promptly submit this Note to the Company. The Company shall deliver the applicable Event of Default Redemption Price to the Holder within five Business Days after the Company's receipt of the Holder's Event of Default Redemption Notice and thereafter the Holder shall promptly deliver this Note to the Company. If the Holder has submitted a Change of Control Redemption Notice in accordance with Section 5(c), the Company shall deliver the applicable Change of Control Redemption Price to the Holder concurrently with the consummation of such Change of Control if such notice is received prior to the consummation of such Change of Control and within five Business Days after the Company's receipt of such notice otherwise. In the event of a redemption of less than all of the Conversion Amount of this Note, the Company shall promptly cause to be issued and delivered to the Holder a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) representing the outstanding Principal which has not been redeemed. In the event that the Company does not pay the Redemption Price to the Holder within the time period required above in this Section 10(a) at any time thereafter and until the Company pays such unpaid Redemption Price in full, the Holder shall have the option to, in lieu of redemption, require the Company to promptly return to the Holder all or any portion of this Note representing the Conversion Amount that was submitted for redemption and for which the applicable Redemption Price (together with any Late Charges thereon) has not been paid. Upon the Company's receipt of such notice, (x) the Redemption Notice shall be null and void with respect to such Conversion Amount, (y) the Company shall immediately return this Note, or issue a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) to the Holder representing such Conversion Amount and (z) the Conversion Price of this Note or such new Notes shall be adjusted to the lesser of (A) the Conversion Price as in effect on the date on which the Redemption Notice is voided and (B) the lowest Closing Bid Price during the period beginning on and including the date on which the Redemption Notice is delivered to the Company and ending on and including the date on which the Redemption Notice is voided. The Holder's delivery of a notice voiding a Redemption Notice and exercise of its rights following such notice shall not affect the Company's obligations to make any payments of Late Charges which have accrued prior to the date of such notice with respect to the Conversion Amount subject to such notice. (b) Redemption by Other Holders. Upon the Company's receipt of notice from any of the holders of the Other Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes for redemption or repayment as a result of an event or occurrence substantially similar to the events or occurrences described in Section 4(b) or Section 5(c) (each an "OTHER REDEMPTION NOTICE"), the Company shall immediately forward to the Holder by facsimile a copy of such notice. If the Company receives a Redemption Notice and one or more Other Redemption Notices during the seven Business Day period beginning on and including the date which is three Business Days prior to the Company's receipt of the Holder's Redemption Notice and ending on and including the date which is three Business Days after the Company's receipt of the Holder's Redemption Notice and the Company is unable to redeem all principal, interest and other amounts designated in such Redemption Notice and such Other Redemption Notices received during such seven 15
Business Day period, then the Company shall redeem a pro rata amount from each holder of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes (including the Holder) based on the principal amount of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes submitted for redemption pursuant to such Redemption Notice and such Other Redemption Notices received by the Company during such seven Business Day period. (c) Redemption at the Option of the Company. (i) Except as provided in this Section 10(c) or in connection with the satisfaction by the Company of its obligations to redeem the Notes under Sections 4(b) and 5(c) hereof, without the prior written consent of the Holder the Company shall not have the right to prepay, redeem, repurchase, defease or otherwise retire any Note prior to the Maturity Date. (ii) Provided the Company has consummated a Qualified 144A Offering at any time during the Company Optional Redemption Period, the Company may deliver an irrevocable written notice to the Holder and the Transfer Agent (the "COMPANY OPTIONAL REDEMPTION NOTICE") within one (1) Business Day after consummation of the Qualified 144A Offering, indicating that the Company has elected to redeem, and is requiring the Holder to submit for redemption, in whole but not in part, the outstanding Principal of this Note plus accrued Interest thereon for the Company Optional Redemption Consideration (a "COMPANY OPTIONAL REDEMPTION"). The Company Optional Redemption Notice shall be sent by facsimile and overnight courier to the Holder and shall indicate (x) the date fixed for redemption, which shall be five (5) Business Days after the expiration of the Company Optional Redemption Period (the "COMPANY OPTIONAL REDEMPTION DATE") and (y) the place or places where this Note is to be surrendered for payment of the Company Optional Redemption Consideration. If the Company has elected a Company Optional Redemption, the Company shall on the Company Optional Redemption Date pay to the Holder the Cash Optional Redemption Consideration, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by such Holder. (11) RESTRICTION ON REDEMPTION. Until all of the Notes have been converted, redeemed or otherwise satisfied in accordance with their terms, the Company shall not, directly or indirectly, redeem its capital stock without the prior express written consent of the holders of Notes representing at least two-thirds of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. (12) SUBORDINATION; ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS. Payments of Principal and Interest and other payments due under this Note shall rank pari passu in right of payment with all (and shall not be subordinated to any) unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company and will be senior in right of payment to all subordinated indebtedness of the Company. (13) COVENANTS. (a) Indebtedness. The Company shall not create, incur, assume, guarantee or suffer to exist, or otherwise become or remain liable with respect to, any Indebtedness other than Permitted Indebtedness and Subordinated Indebtedness. "Subordinated Indebtedness" shall mean Indebtedness that is unsecured and subordinated in right of payment to 16
the Notes and other obligations owing to the Holders in accordance with a subordination agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Holders. "Permitted Indebtedness" shall mean any Indebtedness that is unsecured and is not senior in right of payment to the Notes and is otherwise on terms that are no more favorable to the holders thereof than the terms of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes unless such more favorable terms are offered to the Holders. (b) Liens. The Company shall not create, incur, assume or suffer to exist, or permit any of its Subsidiaries (other than NRG Energy Inc. or its subsidiaries (collectively, "NRG")) to create, incur, assume or suffer to exist, any Lien upon or with respect to any of its properties, whether now owned or hereafter acquired; sign or suffer to exist any security agreement authorizing any secured party thereunder to file a Uniform Commercial Code financing statement (or the equivalent thereof) as notice of a Lien on any property of the Company or its Subsidiaries; sell any of its property or assets subject to an understanding or agreement, contingent or otherwise, to repurchase such property or assets (including sales of accounts receivable) with recourse to it or any of its Subsidiaries or assign or otherwise transfer, or permit any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Existing Utility Subsidiaries (as defined in the Bank Facility)) to assign or otherwise transfer, any account or other right to receive income; other than, as to all of the above, Permitted Liens. As used herein, "Permitted Liens" shall have the meaning of that term as defined in the Five-Year Credit Agreement, dated as of November 10, 2000, among the Company and the banks listed therein (as the same maybe amended from time to time, the "BANK FACILITY"). As used herein, "Liens" means any mortgage, deed of trust, pledge, lien (statutory or otherwise), security interest, charge or other encumbrance or security or preferential arrangement of any nature, including, without limitation, any conditional sale or title retention arrangement, any capitalized lease and any assignment, deposit arrangement or financing lease intended as, or having the effect of, security. (c) Transactions With Affiliates. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, effect any transaction with any Affiliate (as defined in the Bank Facility) that is (a) outside the ordinary course of business or (b) on a basis less favorable than would at the time be obtainable for a comparable transaction in arms-length dealing with an unrelated third party, provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, no loan, payment or other form of contribution shall be made to NRG unless it is in an amount not in excess of (i) $300 Million payable pursuant to the Support Agreement and Capital Subscription Agreement, dated as of May 29, 2002, by and between the Company and NRG Energy Inc. and (ii) $250 Million in respect of guarantee obligations relating to the power marketing business of NRG; provided further that with respect to any payment permitted pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Company shall, in the context of a restructuring of NRG, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain a full release of all obligations and liabilities of the Company relating to NRG. (d) Leverage Ratio. The Company shall not permit the Leverage Ratio set forth in the Bank Facility to be exceeded. (e) Restrictive Agreements. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Significant Subsidiary (as defined in the Bank Facility) other than NRG to, enter into any agreement after the date of this Note that imposes any restriction on the ability of such Significant Subsidiary to make payments, directly or indirectly, to its shareholders by way of 17
dividends, advances, repayment of loans or intercompany charges, expenses or accruals or other returns on investments that is more restrictive than any such restriction applicable to such Significant Subsidiary on the Issuance Date. (f) Scope of Business. The Company shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary to, engage only in energy-related business, functionally related businesses (as interpreted under PUHCA, as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement)or such other businesses as maybe permitted pursuant to an order issued by the SEC pursuant to PUHCA. (14) VOTING RIGHTS.

To convert any Conversion Amount into shares of Common Stock on any date (a "CONVERSION DATE"), the Holder shall (A) transmit by facsimile (or otherwise deliver), for receipt on or prior to 11:59 p.m., Central Time on such date, a copy of an executed notice of conversion in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I (the "CONVERSION NOTICE") to the Company and (B) if required by Section 3(c)(ii), surrender this Note to a common carrier for delivery to the Company as soon as practicable on or following such date (or an indemnification undertaking with respect to this Note in the case of its loss, theft or destruction). On or before the first Business Day following the Company's receipt of a Conversion Notice, the Company shall transmit by facsimile a confirmation of receipt of such Conversion Notice to the Holder and the Transfer Agent (as defined below). On or before the second Business Day following the date of receipt of a Conversion Notice (the "SHARE DELIVERY DATE"), the Company shall (X) (if (Y) below does not apply) issue and deliver to the address as specified in the Conversion Notice, a certificate, registered in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled, or (Y) provided that the Company's transfer agent (the "TRANSFER AGENT") is participating in The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, upon the request of the Holder, credit such aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled to the Holder's or its designee's balance account with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission system. If this Note is physically surrendered for conversion as required by Section 3(c)(ii) and the outstanding Principal of this Note is greater than the Principal portion of the Conversion Amount being converted, then the Company shall as soon as practicable and in no event later than three Business Days after receipt of this Note (the "NOTE DELIVERY DATE") and at its own expense, issue and deliver to the holder a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) representing the outstanding Principal not converted. The person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon a conversion of this Note shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on the Conversion Date. (ii) Book-Entry. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of any portion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Company unless (A) the full Conversion Amount represented by this Note is being converted or (B) the Holder has provided the Company with prior written notice (which notice may be included in a Conversion Notice) requesting physical surrender and reissue of this Note. The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the Principal and Interest converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon conversion. 4
(iii) Pro Rata Conversion; Disputes. In the event that the Company receives a Conversion Notice from more than one holder of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes for the same Conversion Date and the Company can convert some, but not all, of such portions of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes submitted for conversion, the Company, subject to Section 3(d), shall convert from each holder of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes electing to have the Notes or Separate Tranche Notes converted on such date a pro rata amount of such holder's portion of its Notes or Separate Tranche Notes submitted for conversion based on the principal amount of the Notes or Separate Tranche Notes submitted for conversion on such date by such holder relative to the aggregate principal amount of all the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes submitted for conversion on such date. In the event of a dispute as to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable to the Holder in connection with a conversion of this Note, the Company shall issue to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock not in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 23. (d) Limitations on Conversions. (i) Beneficial Ownership. The Company shall not effect any conversion of this Note, and the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to convert any portion of this Note pursuant to Section 3(a), to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion, the Holder (together with the Holder's affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 5.0% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note with respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (A) conversion of the remaining, nonconverted portion of this Note beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its affiliates and (B) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any Other Notes, Separate Tranche Notes or warrants) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its affiliates. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 3(d)(i), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. For purposes of this Section 3(d)(i), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (x) the Company's most recent Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (z) any other notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of the Holder, the Company shall within one Business Day confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Note, by the Holder or its affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. 5
(ii) Principal Market Regulation. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Note if the issuance of such shares of Common Stock would exceed that number of shares of Common Stock which the Company may issue pursuant to the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes without breaching the Company's obligations under the rules or regulations of the Principal Market (the "EXCHANGE CAP"), except that such limitation shall not apply in the event that the Company (A) obtains the approval of its shareholders as required by the applicable rules of the Principal Market for issuances of Common Stock in excess of such amount or (B) obtains a written opinion from outside counsel to the Company that such approval is not required, which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the holders of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes representing a majority of the principal amounts of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes (voting as a single class) then outstanding. Until such approval or written opinion is obtained, no purchaser of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement (the "PURCHASERS") shall be issued, upon conversion of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes, shares of Common Stock in an amount greater than the product of the Exchange Cap multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the principal amount of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes issued to such Purchaser pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement as of the date of such determination and the denominator of which is the aggregate principal amount of all the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes issued to the Purchasers pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement as of the date of such determination (with respect to each Purchaser, the "EXCHANGE CAP ALLOCATION"). In the event that any Purchaser shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such Purchaser's Notes or Separate Tranche Notes, the transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such Purchaser's Exchange Cap Allocation, and the restrictions of the prior sentence shall apply to such transferee with respect to the portion of the Exchange Cap Allocation allocated to such transferee. In the event that any holder of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes shall convert all of such holder's Notes or Separate Tranche Notes into a number of shares of Common Stock which, in the aggregate, is less than such holder's Exchange Cap Allocation, then the difference between such holder's Exchange Cap Allocation and the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued to such holder shall be allocated to the respective Exchange Cap Allocations of the remaining holders of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes on a pro rata basis in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes then held by each such holder. (4) RIGHTS UPON EVENT OF DEFAULT. (a) Event of Default. Each of the following events shall constitute a "EVENT OF DEFAULT": (i) the failure of the Registration Statement covering all Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) required to be registered pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement to be declared effective by the SEC on or prior to the date that is 180 days after the Issuance Date, or, while such Registration Statement is required to be maintained effective pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, 6
the effectiveness of such Registration Statement lapses for any reason (including, without limitation, the issuance of a stop order) or is unavailable to any holder of the Notes for sale of all of such holder's Registrable Securities in accordance with the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, and such lapse or unavailability continues for a period of five consecutive Business Days or for more than an aggregate of 20 Business Days in any 365-day period; (ii) the suspension from trading on the Principal Market for a period of three consecutive Business Days or for more than an aggregate of three Business Days in any 30-day Trading Day period or the delisting of the Common Stock from the Principal Market; (iii) the Company's (A) failure to cure a Conversion Failure by delivery of the required number of shares of Common Stock or a new Note (in accordance with section 18(d)), as applicable, within 10 days after the receipt by the Company of a Conversion Notice or (B) notice, written or oral, to any holder of the Notes, including by way of public announcement or through any of its agents, at any time, of its intention not to comply with a request for conversion of any Notes into shares of Common Stock that is tendered in accordance with the provisions of the Notes; (iv) the Company's failure to pay to the Holder any amount of Principal, Interest, Late Charges or other amounts when and as due under this Note, the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement or any other agreement, document, certificate or other instrument delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby to which the Holder is a party; (v) any default under, redemption of or acceleration prior to maturity of any Indebtedness (as defined in Section 3(r) of the Securities Purchase Agreement) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 3(a) of the Securities Purchase Agreement) other than NRG (as defined below) (including, without limitation, the Other Notes) of at least $50,000,000; (vi) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than NRG (as defined below), pursuant to or within the meaning of Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar Federal or state law for the relief of debtors (collectively, "BANKRUPTCY LAW"), (A) commences a voluntary case, (B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case, (C) consents to the appointment of a receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator or similar official (a "CUSTODIAN"), (D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors or (E) admits in writing that it is generally unable to pay its debts as they become due; (vii) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that (A) is for relief against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than NRG (as defined below) in an involuntary case, (B) appoints a Custodian of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than NRG (as defined below) or (C) orders the liquidation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than NRG (as defined below); or 7
(viii) the Company breaches any representation, warranty, covenant (other than any covenant to deliver the NRG Opinion) or other term or condition of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement, this Note or any other agreement, document, certificate or other instrument delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby and hereby to which the Holder is a party, except, in the case of a breach of a covenant which is curable, only if such breach continues for a period of at least 10 consecutive days. (b) Redemption Right. Promptly after the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to this Note or the Other Notes, the Company shall deliver written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier (a "EVENT OF DEFAULT NOTICE") to the Holder. At any time after the earlier of the Holder's receipt of an Event of Default Notice and the Holder becoming aware of an Event of Default, the Holder may require the Company to redeem all or any portion of this Note by delivering written notice thereof (the "EVENT OF DEFAULT REDEMPTION NOTICE") to the Company, which Event of Default Redemption Notice shall indicate the portion of this Note the Holder is electing to redeem. Each portion of this Note subject to redemption by the Company pursuant to this Section 4(b) shall be redeemed by the Company at a price equal to the greater of (i) the product of (x) the Conversion Amount and (y) the quotient determined by dividing (A) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock immediately prior to such Event of Default by (B) the Conversion Price and (ii) the product of (x) the Conversion Amount and (y) the Redemption Premium (the "EVENT OF DEFAULT REDEMPTION PRICE"). Redemptions required by this Section 4(b) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 10. (5) RIGHTS UPON CHANGE OF CONTROL. (a) Change of Control. Each of the following events shall constitute a "CHANGE OF CONTROL": (i) the consolidation, merger or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization or recapitalization) of the Company with or into another Person in which holders of the Company's voting power immediately prior to the transaction cease after the transaction to hold, directly or indirectly, a majority of the voting power of the surviving entity or entities or the voting power necessary to elect a majority of the members of the board of directors (or their equivalent if other than a corporation) of such entity or entities; (ii) the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Company's assets; or (iii) a purchase, tender or exchange offer made to and accepted by the holders of more than the 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. (b) Assumption. Prior to the consummation of any Change of Control, the Company will secure from any Person purchasing the Company's assets or Common Stock or any successor resulting from such Change of Control (in each case, an "ACQUIRING ENTITY") a written agreement (in form and substance satisfactory to the holders of Notes representing a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding) to deliver to each 8
holder of Notes in exchange for such Notes, a security of the Acquiring Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to the Notes, including, without limitation, having a principal amount and interest rate equal to the principal amounts and the interest rates of the Notes held by such holder, and satisfactory to the holders of Notes representing a majority of the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. In the event that an Acquiring Entity is directly or indirectly controlled by a company or entity whose common stock or similar equity interest is listed, designated or quoted on a securities exchange or trading market, the holders of notes representing a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may elect to treat such Person as the Acquiring Entity for purposes of this Section 5(b). (c) Redemption Right. No sooner than 15 days nor later than 10 days prior to the consummation of a Change of Control, but not prior to the public announcement of such Change of Control, the Company shall deliver written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier to the Holder (a "CHANGE OF CONTROL NOTICE"). At any time on or after consummation of such Change of Control, the Holder may require the Company to redeem all or any portion of this Note by delivering written notice thereof ("CHANGE OF CONTROL REDEMPTION NOTICE" and, collectively with an Event of Default Redemption Notice, "REDEMPTION NOTICES" and, individually, each a "REDEMPTION NOTICE") to the Company, which Change of Control Redemption Notice shall indicate the Conversion Amount the Holder is electing to redeem. The portion of this Note subject to redemption pursuant to this Section 5(c) shall be redeemed by the Company at a price equal to the greater of (i) the product of (x) the Conversion Amount and (y) the quotient determined by dividing (A) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock immediately following the public announcement of such proposed Change of Control by (B) the Conversion Price and (ii) 115% of the Conversion Amount (the "CHANGE OF CONTROL REDEMPTION PRICE" and, together with the Event of Default Redemption Price, the "REDEMPTION PRICE"). Redemptions required by this Section 5(c) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 and shall have priority to payments to other shareholders in connection with a Change of Control. (6) RIGHTS UPON ISSUANCE OF PURCHASE RIGHTS AND OTHER CORPORATE EVENTS. (a) Purchase Rights. If at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of Common Stock (the "PURCHASE RIGHTS"), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of this Note) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights. 9
(b) Other Corporate Events. Prior to the consummation of any recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation, merger or other business combination (other than a Change of Control) pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock (a "CORPORATE EVENT"), the Company shall make appropriate provision to insure that the Holder will thereafter have the right to receive upon a conversion of this Note, (i) in addition to the shares of Common Stock receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets to which the Holder would have been entitled with respect to such shares of Common Stock had such shares of Common Stock been held by the Holder upon the consummation of such Corporate Event or (ii) in lieu of the shares of Common Stock otherwise receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets received by the holders of Common Stock in connection with the consummation of such Corporate Event in such amounts as the Holder would have been entitled to receive had this Note initially been issued with conversion rights for the form of such consideration (as opposed to shares of Common Stock) at a conversion rate for such consideration commensurate with the Conversion Rate. Provision made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be in a form and substance satisfactory to the holders of Notes representing a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. (7) RIGHTS UPON ISSUANCE OF OTHER SECURITIES. (a) Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Issuance of Common Stock. If and whenever on or after the issuance date of the First Notes, the Company issues or sells, or in accordance with this Section 7(a) is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of Common Stock (including the issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock owned or held by or for the account of the Company, but excluding shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold by the Company (I) in connection with the Xcel Energy Direct Purchase Plan or any employee benefit plan which has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, pursuant to which the Company's securities may be issued to any employee, officer or director for services provided to the Company or its Subsidiaries (each, an "APPROVED STOCK PLAN") or (II) upon conversion of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes) for a consideration per share less than the higher of the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the date of such issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale and the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale (such higher price is referred to herein as the "APPLICABLE PRICE"), then immediately after such issue or sale (subject to Section 7(a)(vi)), the Conversion Price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to the product of (x) the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale or deemed issuance or sale and (y) the quotient determined by dividing (1) the sum of the product of the Applicable Price and the number of shares of Common Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale or deemed issue or sale and the consideration, if any, received by the Company upon such issue or sale, by (2) the product of the Applicable Price multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately after such issue or sale or deemed issue or sale. For purposes of determining the adjusted Conversion Price under this Section 7(a), the following shall be applicable: (i) Issuance of Options. If the Company in any manner grants or sells any Options and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the 10
exercise of any such Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of such Option is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the granting or sale of such Option for such price per share. For purposes of this Section 7(a)(i), the "lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of such Option" shall be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon granting or sale of the Option, upon exercise of the Option and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon exercise of such Option. No further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock or of such Convertible Securities upon the exercise of such Options or upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities. If the Company issues or sells any Options which are Variable Securities, no adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made pursuant to this Section 7(a), and no shares of Common Stock shall be deemed outstanding with respect to such Variable Securities, as a result of the issuance of such Variable Securities until the actual issuance of Common Stock or Convertible Securities upon exercise of such Variable Securities, except to the extent such Variable Security also includes as a component of the exercise price a price which does not vary with the market price of the Common Stock. (ii) Issuance of Convertible Securities. If the Company in any manner issues or sells any Convertible Securities and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion, exercise or exchange thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the issuance of sale of such Convertible Securities for such price per share. For the purposes of this Section 7(a)(ii), the "price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion, exercise or exchange" shall be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the issuance or sale of the Convertible Security and upon the conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Security. No further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities, and if any such issue or sale of such Convertible Securities is made upon exercise of any Options for which adjustment of the Conversion Price had been or are to be made pursuant to other provisions of this Section 7(a), no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made by reason of such issue or sale. If the Company issues or sells any Convertible Securities which are Variable Securities, no adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made pursuant to this Section 7(a), and no shares of Common Stock shall be deemed outstanding with respect to such Variable Security, as a result of the issuance of such Variable Securities until the actual issuance of Common Stock upon exercise of such Variable Securities, except to the extent such Variable Security also includes as a 11
component of the conversion, exercise or exchange price a price which does not vary with the market price of the Common Stock. (iii) Change in Option Price or Rate of Conversion. If the purchase price provided for in any Options, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issue, conversion or exchange of any Convertible Securities, or the rate at which any Convertible Securities are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock changes at any time, the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such change shall be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been in effect at such time had such Options or Convertible Securities provided for such changed purchase price, additional consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold. For purposes of this Section 7(a)(iii), if the terms of any Option or Convertible Security that was outstanding as of the Issuance Date are changed in the manner described in the immediately preceding sentence, then such Option or Convertible Security and the Common Stock deemed issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such change. No adjustment shall be made if such adjustment would result in an increase of the Conversion Price then in effect. (iv) Calculation of Consideration Received. In case any Option is issued in connection with the issue or sale of other securities of the Company, together comprising one integrated transaction in which no specific consideration is allocated to such Options by the parties thereto, the Options will be deemed to have been issued for a consideration of $.01. If any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor will be deemed to be the net amount received by the Company therefor. If any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the Company will be the fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of securities, in which case the amount of consideration received by the Company will be the Closing Sale Price of such securities on the date of receipt. If any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the Company is the surviving entity, the amount of consideration therefor will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to such Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, as the case may be. The fair value of any consideration other than cash or securities will be determined jointly by the Company and the holders of Notes representing a majority of the principal amounts of the Notes then outstanding. If such parties are unable to reach agreement within ten days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the "VALUATION Event"), the fair value of such consideration will be determined within five Business Days after the tenth day following the Valuation Event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly selected by the Company and the holders of Notes representing a majority of the principal amounts of the Notes then outstanding. The determination of such appraiser shall be deemed binding upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the Company. 12
(v) Record Date. If the Company takes a record of the holders of Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (A) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in Common Stock, Options or in Convertible Securities or (B) to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date will be deemed to be the date of the issue or sale of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. (vi) Common Stock Deemed Outstanding. "COMMON STOCK DEEMED OUTSTANDING" means, at any given time, the number of shares of Common Stock actually outstanding at such time, plus the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be outstanding pursuant to Sections 7(a)(i) and 7(a)(ii) hereof regardless of whether the Options or Convertible Securities are actually exercisable at such time, but excluding any shares of Common Stock owned or held by or for the account of the Company or issuable upon conversion of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes. (vii) Delayed Adjustment. In addition to the foregoing provisions of this Section 7(a), the Weighted Average Price, Closing Sales Price and Closing Bid Price shall be subject to adjustment, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, for any days during any measuring period, including, without limitation, the Tranche A Pricing Period, used herein that occur prior to any of the aforementioned events if such events occur prior to the end of such measuring period. (b) Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock. If the Company at any time subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. If the Company at any time combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased. (c) Other Events. If any event occurs of the type contemplated by the provisions of this Section 7 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then the Company's Board of Directors will make an appropriate adjustment in the Conversion Price so as to protect the rights of the Holder under this Note; provided that no such adjustment will increase the Conversion Price as otherwise determined pursuant to this Section 7. (8) NONCIRCUMVENTION. The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Articles of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the 13
terms of, or enter into any agreement which by its terms restricts or otherwise impairs the Company's performance of the terms of, this Note or any of the other Transaction Documents (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement), and will at all times in good faith carry out all of the provisions of this Note and take all action as may be required to protect the rights of the Holder of this Note. (9) RESERVATION OF AUTHORIZED SHARES. (a) Reservation. The Company shall initially reserve out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock a number of shares of Common Stock for each of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes equal to 115% of the Conversion Rate with respect to the Conversion Amount of each such Note and Separate Tranche Note. Thereafter, the Company shall, so long as any of the Notes or Separate Tranche Notes are outstanding, take all action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Notes and Separate Tranche Note, at least 100% of the number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion of all of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes then outstanding; provided that at no time shall the number of shares of Common Stock so reserved be less than the number of shares required to be reserved by the previous sentence (without regard to any limitations on conversions) (the "REQUIRED RESERVE AMOUNT"). The initial number of shares of Common Stock reserved for conversions of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Note and each increase in the number of shares so reserved shall be allocated pro rata among the holders of the Notes and Separate Tranche Note based on the principal amount of the Notes and Separate Tranche Notes held by each holder at the time of Issuance Date or increase in the number of reserved shares, as the case may be (the "AUTHORIZED SHARE ALLOCATION"). In the event that a holder shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such holder's Notes, each transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such holder's Authorized Share Allocation. Any shares of Common Stock reserved and allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Notes shall be allocated to the remaining holders of Notes, pro rata based on the principal amount of the Notes then held by such holders. (b) Insufficient Authorized Shares. If at any time while any of the Notes or Separate Tranche Note remain outstanding the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved shares of Common Stock to satisfy its obligation to reserve for issuance upon conversion of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes at least a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Required Reserve Amount (an "AUTHORIZED SHARE FAILURE"), then the Company shall immediately take all action necessary to increase the Company's authorized shares of Common Stock to an amount sufficient to allow the Company to reserve the Required Reserve Amount for the Notes and Separate Tranche Note then outstanding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the date of the occurrence of an Authorized Share Failure, but in no event later than 60 days after the occurrence of such Authorized Share Failure, the Company shall hold a meeting of its shareholders for the approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock. In connection with such meeting, the Company shall provide each shareholder with a proxy statement and shall use its best efforts to solicit its shareholders' approval of such increase in authorized shares of Common Stock and to cause its board of directors to recommend to the shareholders that they approve such proposal. 14
(10) REDEMPTION. (a) Mechanics. In the event that the Holder has sent a Redemption Notice to the Company pursuant to Section 4(b) or Section 5(c), the Holder shall promptly submit this Note to the Company. The Company shall deliver the applicable Event of Default Redemption Price to the Holder within five Business Days after the Company's receipt of the Holder's Event of Default Redemption Notice and thereafter the Holder shall promptly deliver this Note to the Company. If the Holder has submitted a Change of Control Redemption Notice in accordance with Section 5(c), the Company shall deliver the applicable Change of Control Redemption Price to the Holder concurrently with the consummation of such Change of Control if such notice is received prior to the consummation of such Change of Control and within five Business Days after the Company's receipt of such notice otherwise.

If the Company shall fail to credit the Holder's balance account with DTC (as defined in Section 3(c)(i)) or, if requested in writing by the Holder, to issue a certificate to the Holder for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled upon conversion of any Conversion Amount or to issue a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) representing the Principal portion of the Conversion Amount (as defined in Section 3(b)(i)) to which the Holder is entitled, in each case within the time periods set out in Section 3(c)(i) (in each case, a "CONVERSION FAILURE"), then during each period beginning on and including the date of each such Conversion Failure and ending on and including the date such Conversion Failure is cured, the Interest Rate then in effect shall be increased by two percentage points (2%). If (i) the Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) covering all the Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) issuable upon conversion of this Note and required to be filed by 2
the Company pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement is not declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on or before the applicable Mandatory Effective Date (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) or (ii) on any day after such Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC that sales of all the Registrable Securities required to be included on such Registration Statement cannot be made (other than during an Allowable Grace Period (as defined in Section 3(t) of the Registration Rights Agreement) pursuant to such Registration Statement (including, without limitation, because of a failure to keep such Registration Statement effective, to disclose such information as is necessary for sales to be made pursuant to such Registration Statement or to register sufficient shares of Common Stock) (collectively with the event described in the immediately preceding clause (i), each a "REGISTRATION FAILURE"), then, as partial relief for the damages to any holder by reason of any such delay in or reduction of its ability to sell Registrable Securities (which remedy shall not be exclusive of any other remedies available at law or in equity) the Interest Rate then in effect shall be increased by two percentage points (2%) during each period beginning on and including the first date of each such Registration Failure and ending on and including the date such Registration Failure is cured. (3) CONVERSION OF NOTES. This Note shall be convertible into shares of the Common Stock, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 3. (a) Conversion Right. Subject to the provisions of Section 3(d), at any time or times on or after the Issuance Date, the Holder shall be entitled to convert any portion of the outstanding and unpaid Conversion Amount (as defined below) into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 3(c), at the Conversion Rate (as defined below). The Company shall not issue any fraction of a share of Common Stock upon any conversion. If the issuance would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of Common Stock, the Company shall round such fraction of a share of Common Stock up to the nearest whole share. The Company shall pay any and all taxes that may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of Common Stock upon conversion of any Conversion Amount. (b) Conversion Rate. The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any Conversion Amount pursuant to Section 3(a) shall be determined by dividing (x) such Conversion Amount by (y) the Conversion Price (as defined below) (the "CONVERSION RATE"). (i) "CONVERSION AMOUNT" means the sum of (A) the portion of the Principal to be converted, redeemed or otherwise surrendered with respect to which this determination is being made, (B) accrued and unpaid Interest with respect to such Principal and (C) accrued and unpaid Late Charges with respect to such Principal and Interest. (ii) "CONVERSION PRICE" means, 110% of the Weighted Average Price of the Common Stock during the Tranche B Pricing Period; provided that the Conversion Price shall not exceed 110% of the Tranche B Base Price; provided further, that in the event that the Company has not delivered a Company Optional Redemption Notice as of the date that is 35 Business Days after the date of issuance of the First Notes and 110% of the Closing Bid Price of the Common Stock on such date is less than the Conversion Price 3
then in effect (after giving effect to the calculation of the Conversion Price through the end of such day and the conclusion of the Tranche B Pricing Period), then the Conversion Price shall be reduced to equal such price. (c) Mechanics of Conversion. (i) Optional Conversion. To convert any Conversion Amount into shares of Common Stock on any date (a "CONVERSION DATE"), the Holder shall (A) transmit by facsimile (or otherwise deliver), for receipt on or prior to 11:59 p.m., Central Time on such date, a copy of an executed notice of conversion in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I (the "CONVERSION NOTICE") to the Company and (B) if required by Section 3(c)(ii), surrender this Note to a common carrier for delivery to the Company as soon as practicable on or following such date (or an indemnification undertaking with respect to this Note in the case of its loss, theft or destruction). On or before the first Business Day following the Company's receipt of a Conversion Notice, the Company shall transmit by facsimile a confirmation of receipt of such Conversion Notice to the Holder and the Transfer Agent (as defined below). On or before the second Business Day following the date of receipt of a Conversion Notice (the "SHARE DELIVERY DATE"), the Company shall (X) (if (Y) below does not apply) issue and deliver to the address as specified in the Conversion Notice, a certificate, registered in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled, or (Y) provided that the Company's transfer agent (the "TRANSFER AGENT") is participating in The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, upon the request of the Holder, credit such aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled to the Holder's or its designee's balance account with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission system. If this Note is physically surrendered for conversion as required by Section 3(c)(ii) and the outstanding Principal of this Note is greater than the Principal portion of the Conversion Amount being converted, then the Company shall as soon as practicable and in no event later than three Business Days after receipt of this Note (the "NOTE DELIVERY DATE") and at its own expense, issue and deliver to the holder a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) representing the outstanding Principal not converted. The person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon a conversion of this Note shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on the Conversion Date. (ii) Book-Entry. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of any portion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Company unless (A) the full Conversion Amount represented by this Note is being converted or (B) the Holder has provided the Company with prior written notice (which notice may be included in a Conversion Notice) requesting physical surrender and reissue of this Note. The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the Principal and Interest converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon conversion. 4
(iii) Pro Rata Conversion; Disputes. In the event that the Company receives a Conversion Notice from more than one holder of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes for the same Conversion Date and the Company can convert some, but not all, of such portions of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes submitted for conversion, the Company, subject to Section 3(d), shall convert from each holder of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes electing to have the Notes or Separate Tranche Notes converted on such date a pro rata amount of such holder's portion of its Notes or Separate Tranche Notes submitted for conversion based on the principal amount of the Notes or Separate Tranche Notes submitted for conversion on such date by such holder relative to the aggregate principal amount of all the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes submitted for conversion on such date. In the event of a dispute as to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable to the Holder in connection with a conversion of this Note, the Company shall issue to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock not in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 23. (d) Limitations on Conversions. (i) Beneficial Ownership. The Company shall not effect any conversion of this Note, and the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to convert any portion of this Note pursuant to Section 3(a), to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion, the Holder (together with the Holder's affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 5.0% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note with respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (A) conversion of the remaining, nonconverted portion of this Note beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its affiliates and (B) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any Other Notes, Separate Tranche Notes or warrants) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its affiliates. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 3(d)(i), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. For purposes of this Section 3(d)(i), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (x) the Company's most recent Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (z) any other notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of the Holder, the Company shall within one Business Day confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of 5
securities of the Company, including this Note, by the Holder or its affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. (ii) Principal Market Regulation. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Note if the issuance of such shares of Common Stock would exceed that number of shares of Common Stock which the Company may issue pursuant to the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes without breaching the Company's obligations under the rules or regulations of the Principal Market (the "EXCHANGE CAP"), except that such limitation shall not apply in the event that the Company (A) obtains the approval of its shareholders as required by the applicable rules of the Principal Market for issuances of Common Stock in excess of such amount or (B) obtains a written opinion from outside counsel to the Company that such approval is not required, which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the holders of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes representing a majority of the principal amounts of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes (voting as a single class) then outstanding. Until such approval or written opinion is obtained, no purchaser of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement (the "PURCHASERS") shall be issued, upon conversion of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes, shares of Common Stock in an amount greater than the product of the Exchange Cap multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the principal amount of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes issued to such Purchaser pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement as of the date of such determination and the denominator of which is the aggregate principal amount of all the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes issued to the Purchasers pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement as of the date of such determination (with respect to each Purchaser, the "EXCHANGE CAP ALLOCATION"). In the event that any Purchaser shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such Purchaser's Notes or Separate Tranche Notes, the transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such Purchaser's Exchange Cap Allocation, and the restrictions of the prior sentence shall apply to such transferee with respect to the portion of the Exchange Cap Allocation allocated to such transferee. In the event that any holder of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes shall convert all of such holder's Notes or Separate Tranche Notes into a number of shares of Common Stock which, in the aggregate, is less than such holder's Exchange Cap Allocation, then the difference between such holder's Exchange Cap Allocation and the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued to such holder shall be allocated to the respective Exchange Cap Allocations of the remaining holders of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes on a pro rata basis in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes then held by each such holder. (4) RIGHTS UPON EVENT OF DEFAULT. (a) Event of Default. Each of the following events shall constitute a "EVENT OF DEFAULT": (i) the failure of the Registration Statement covering all Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) required to be registered pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement to be declared effective by the SEC on or prior to the date 6
that is 180 days after the Issuance Date, or, while such Registration Statement is required to be maintained effective pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, the effectiveness of such Registration Statement lapses for any reason (including, without limitation, the issuance of a stop order) or is unavailable to any holder of the Notes for sale of all of such holder's Registrable Securities in accordance with the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, and such lapse or unavailability continues for a period of five consecutive Business Days or for more than an aggregate of 20 Business Days in any 365-day period; (ii) the suspension from trading on the Principal Market for a period of three consecutive Business Days or for more than an aggregate of three Business Days in any 30-day Trading Day period or the delisting of the Common Stock from the Principal Market; (iii) the Company's (A) failure to cure a Conversion Failure by delivery of the required number of shares of Common Stock or a new Note (in accordance with section 18(d)), as applicable, within 10 days after the receipt by the Company of a Conversion Notice or (B) notice, written or oral, to any holder of the Notes, including by way of public announcement or through any of its agents, at any time, of its intention not to comply with a request for conversion of any Notes into shares of Common Stock that is tendered in accordance with the provisions of the Notes; (iv) the Company's failure to pay to the Holder any amount of Principal, Interest, Late Charges or other amounts when and as due under this Note, the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement or any other agreement, document, certificate or other instrument delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby to which the Holder is a party; (v) any default under, redemption of or acceleration prior to maturity of any Indebtedness (as defined in Section 3(r) of the Securities Purchase Agreement) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 3(a) of the Securities Purchase Agreement) other than NRG (as defined below) (including, without limitation, the Other Notes) of at least $50,000,000; (vi) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than NRG (as defined below), pursuant to or within the meaning of Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar Federal or state law for the relief of debtors (collectively, "BANKRUPTCY LAW"), (A) commences a voluntary case, (B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case, (C) consents to the appointment of a receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator or similar official (a "CUSTODIAN"), (D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors or (E) admits in writing that it is generally unable to pay its debts as they become due; (vii) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that (A) is for relief against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than NRG (as defined below) in an involuntary case, (B) appoints a Custodian of the Company or 7
any of its Subsidiaries other than NRG (as defined below) or (C) orders the liquidation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than NRG (as defined below); or (viii) the Company breaches any representation, warranty, covenant (other than any covenant to deliver the NRG Opinion) or other term or condition of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement, this Note or any other agreement, document, certificate or other instrument delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby and hereby to which the Holder is a party, except, in the case of a breach of a covenant which is curable, only if such breach continues for a period of at least 10 consecutive days. (b) Redemption Right. Promptly after the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to this Note or the Other Notes, the Company shall deliver written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier (a "EVENT OF DEFAULT NOTICE") to the Holder. At any time after the earlier of the Holder's receipt of an Event of Default Notice and the Holder becoming aware of an Event of Default, the Holder may require the Company to redeem all or any portion of this Note by delivering written notice thereof (the "EVENT OF DEFAULT REDEMPTION NOTICE") to the Company, which Event of Default Redemption Notice shall indicate the portion of this Note the Holder is electing to redeem. Each portion of this Note subject to redemption by the Company pursuant to this Section 4(b) shall be redeemed by the Company at a price equal to the greater of (i) the product of (x) the Conversion Amount and (y) the quotient determined by dividing (A) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock immediately prior to such Event of Default by (B) the Conversion Price and (ii) the product of (x) the Conversion Amount and (y) the Redemption Premium (the "EVENT OF DEFAULT REDEMPTION PRICE"). Redemptions required by this Section 4(b) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 10. (5) RIGHTS UPON CHANGE OF CONTROL. (a) Change of Control. Each of the following events shall constitute a "CHANGE OF CONTROL": (i) the consolidation, merger or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization or recapitalization) of the Company with or into another Person in which holders of the Company's voting power immediately prior to the transaction cease after the transaction to hold, directly or indirectly, a majority of the voting power of the surviving entity or entities or the voting power necessary to elect a majority of the members of the board of directors (or their equivalent if other than a corporation) of such entity or entities; (ii) the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Company's assets; or (iii) a purchase, tender or exchange offer made to and accepted by the holders of more than the 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. (b) Assumption. Prior to the consummation of any Change of Control, the Company will secure from any Person purchasing the Company's assets or Common Stock 8
or any successor resulting from such Change of Control (in each case, an "ACQUIRING ENTITY") a written agreement (in form and substance satisfactory to the holders of Notes representing a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding) to deliver to each holder of Notes in exchange for such Notes, a security of the Acquiring Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to the Notes, including, without limitation, having a principal amount and interest rate equal to the principal amounts and the interest rates of the Notes held by such holder, and satisfactory to the holders of Notes representing a majority of the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. In the event that an Acquiring Entity is directly or indirectly controlled by a company or entity whose common stock or similar equity interest is listed, designated or quoted on a securities exchange or trading market, the holders of notes representing a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may elect to treat such Person as the Acquiring Entity for purposes of this Section 5(b). (c) Redemption Right. No sooner than 15 days nor later than 10 days prior to the consummation of a Change of Control, but not prior to the public announcement of such Change of Control, the Company shall deliver written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier to the Holder (a "CHANGE OF CONTROL NOTICE"). At any time on or after consummation of such Change of Control, the Holder may require the Company to redeem all or any portion of this Note by delivering written notice thereof ("CHANGE OF CONTROL REDEMPTION NOTICE" and, collectively with an Event of Default Redemption Notice, "REDEMPTION NOTICES" and, individually, each a "REDEMPTION NOTICE") to the Company, which Change of Control Redemption Notice shall indicate the Conversion Amount the Holder is electing to redeem. The portion of this Note subject to redemption pursuant to this Section 5(c) shall be redeemed by the Company at a price equal to the greater of (i) the product of (x) the Conversion Amount and (y) the quotient determined by dividing (A) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock immediately following the public announcement of such proposed Change of Control by (B) the Conversion Price and (ii) 115% of the Conversion Amount (the "CHANGE OF CONTROL REDEMPTION PRICE" and, together with the Event of Default Redemption Price, the "REDEMPTION PRICE"). Redemptions required by this Section 5(c) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 and shall have priority to payments to other shareholders in connection with a Change of Control. (6) RIGHTS UPON ISSUANCE OF PURCHASE RIGHTS AND OTHER CORPORATE EVENTS. (a) Purchase Rights. If at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of Common Stock (the "PURCHASE RIGHTS"), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of this Note) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, 9
or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights. (b) Other Corporate Events. Prior to the consummation of any recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation, merger or other business combination (other than a Change of Control) pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock (a "CORPORATE EVENT"), the Company shall make appropriate provision to insure that the Holder will thereafter have the right to receive upon a conversion of this Note, (i) in addition to the shares of Common Stock receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets to which the Holder would have been entitled with respect to such shares of Common Stock had such shares of Common Stock been held by the Holder upon the consummation of such Corporate Event or (ii) in lieu of the shares of Common Stock otherwise receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets received by the holders of Common Stock in connection with the consummation of such Corporate Event in such amounts as the Holder would have been entitled to receive had this Note initially been issued with conversion rights for the form of such consideration (as opposed to shares of Common Stock) at a conversion rate for such consideration commensurate with the Conversion Rate. Provision made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be in a form and substance satisfactory to the holders of Notes representing a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. (7) RIGHTS UPON ISSUANCE OF OTHER SECURITIES. (a) Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Issuance of Common Stock. If and whenever on or after the issuance date of the Second Notes, the Company issues or sells, or in accordance with this Section 7(a) is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of Common Stock (including the issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock owned or held by or for the account of the Company, but excluding shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold by the Company (I) in connection with the Xcel Energy Direct Purchase Plan or any employee benefit plan which has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, pursuant to which the Company's securities may be issued to any employee, officer or director for services provided to the Company or its Subsidiaries (each, an "APPROVED STOCK PLAN") or (II) upon conversion of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes) for a consideration per share less than the higher of the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the date of such issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale and the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale (such higher price is referred to herein as the "APPLICABLE PRICE"), then immediately after such issue or sale (subject to Section 7(a)(vi)), the Conversion Price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to the product of (x) the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale or deemed issuance or sale and (y) the quotient determined by dividing (1) the sum of the product of the Applicable Price and the number of shares of Common Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale or deemed issue or sale and the consideration, if any, received by the Company upon such issue or sale, by (2) the product of the Applicable Price multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately after such issue or sale or deemed issue or sale. For purposes of determining the adjusted Conversion Price under this Section 7(a), the following shall be applicable: 10
(i) Issuance of Options. If the Company in any manner grants or sells any Options and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of such Option is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the granting or sale of such Option for such price per share. For purposes of this Section 7(a)(i), the "lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of such Option" shall be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon granting or sale of the Option, upon exercise of the Option and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon exercise of such Option. No further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock or of such Convertible Securities upon the exercise of such Options or upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities. If the Company issues or sells any Options which are Variable Securities, no adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made pursuant to this Section 7(a), and no shares of Common Stock shall be deemed outstanding with respect to such Variable Securities, as a result of the issuance of such Variable Securities until the actual issuance of Common Stock or Convertible Securities upon exercise of such Variable Securities, except to the extent such Variable Security also includes as a component of the exercise price a price which does not vary with the market price of the Common Stock. (ii) Issuance of Convertible Securities. If the Company in any manner issues or sells any Convertible Securities and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion, exercise or exchange thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the issuance of sale of such Convertible Securities for such price per share. For the purposes of this Section 7(a)(ii), the "price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion, exercise or exchange" shall be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the issuance or sale of the Convertible Security and upon the conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Security. No further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities, and if any such issue or sale of such Convertible Securities is made upon exercise of any Options for which adjustment of the Conversion Price had been or are to be made pursuant to other provisions of this Section 7(a), no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made by reason of such issue or sale. If the Company issues or sells any Convertible Securities which are Variable Securities, no adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made pursuant to this Section 7(a), and no shares of Common Stock shall be deemed outstanding with respect to such Variable Security, as a result of the issuance of such Variable Securities until the actual issuance 11
of Common Stock upon exercise of such Variable Securities, except to the extent such Variable Security also includes as a component of the conversion, exercise or exchange price a price which does not vary with the market price of the Common Stock. (iii) Change in Option Price or Rate of Conversion. If the purchase price provided for in any Options, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issue, conversion or exchange of any Convertible Securities, or the rate at which any Convertible Securities are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock changes at any time, the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such change shall be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been in effect at such time had such Options or Convertible Securities provided for such changed purchase price, additional consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold. For purposes of this Section 7(a)(iii), if the terms of any Option or Convertible Security that was outstanding as of the Issuance Date are changed in the manner described in the immediately preceding sentence, then such Option or Convertible Security and the Common Stock deemed issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such change. No adjustment shall be made if such adjustment would result in an increase of the Conversion Price then in effect. (iv) Calculation of Consideration Received. In case any Option is issued in connection with the issue or sale of other securities of the Company, together comprising one integrated transaction in which no specific consideration is allocated to such Options by the parties thereto, the Options will be deemed to have been issued for a consideration of $.01. If any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor will be deemed to be the net amount received by the Company therefor. If any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the Company will be the fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of securities, in which case the amount of consideration received by the Company will be the Closing Sale Price of such securities on the date of receipt. If any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the Company is the surviving entity, the amount of consideration therefor will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to such Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, as the case may be. The fair value of any consideration other than cash or securities will be determined jointly by the Company and the holders of Notes representing a majority of the principal amounts of the Notes then outstanding. If such parties are unable to reach agreement within ten days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the "VALUATION EVENT"), the fair value of such consideration will be determined within five Business Days after the tenth day following the Valuation Event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly selected by the Company and the holders of Notes representing a majority of the principal amounts of the Notes then outstanding. The determination of such appraiser shall be deemed binding 12
upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the Company. (v) Record Date. If the Company takes a record of the holders of Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (A) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in Common Stock, Options or in Convertible Securities or (B) to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date will be deemed to be the date of the issue or sale of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. (vi) Common Stock Deemed Outstanding. "COMMON STOCK DEEMED OUTSTANDING" means, at any given time, the number of shares of Common Stock actually outstanding at such time, plus the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be outstanding pursuant to Sections 7(a)(i) and 7(a)(ii) hereof regardless of whether the Options or Convertible Securities are actually exercisable at such time, but excluding any shares of Common Stock owned or held by or for the account of the Company or issuable upon conversion of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes. (vii) Delayed Adjustment. In addition to the foregoing provisions of this Section 7(a), the Weighted Average Price, Closing Sales Price and Closing Bid Price shall be subject to adjustment, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, for any days during any measuring period, including, without limitation, the Tranche A Pricing Period, used herein that occur prior to any of the aforementioned events if such events occur prior to the end of such measuring period. (b) Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock. If the Company at any time subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. If the Company at any time combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased. (c) Other Events. If any event occurs of the type contemplated by the provisions of this Section 7 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then the Company's Board of Directors will make an appropriate adjustment in the Conversion Price so as to protect the rights of the Holder under this Note; provided that no such adjustment will increase the Conversion Price as otherwise determined pursuant to this Section 7. (8) NONCIRCUMVENTION. The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Articles of Incorporation or through any 13
reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of, or enter into any agreement which by its terms restricts or otherwise impairs the Company's performance of the terms of, this Note or any of the other Transaction Documents (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement), and will at all times in good faith carry out all of the provisions of this Note and take all action as may be required to protect the rights of the Holder of this Note. (9) RESERVATION OF AUTHORIZED SHARES. (a) Reservation. The Company shall initially reserve out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock a number of shares of Common Stock for each of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes equal to 115% of the Conversion Rate with respect to the Conversion Amount of each such Note and Separate Tranche Note. Thereafter, the Company shall, so long as any of the Notes or Separate Tranche Notes are outstanding, take all action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Notes and Separate Tranche Note, at least 100% of the number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion of all of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes then outstanding; provided that at no time shall the number of shares of Common Stock so reserved be less than the number of shares required to be reserved by the previous sentence (without regard to any limitations on conversions) (the "REQUIRED RESERVE AMOUNT"). The initial number of shares of Common Stock reserved for conversions of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Note and each increase in the number of shares so reserved shall be allocated pro rata among the holders of the Notes and Separate Tranche Note based on the principal amount of the Notes and Separate Tranche Notes held by each holder at the time of Issuance Date or increase in the number of reserved shares, as the case may be (the "AUTHORIZED SHARE ALLOCATION"). In the event that a holder shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such holder's Notes, each transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such holder's Authorized Share Allocation. Any shares of Common Stock reserved and allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Notes shall be allocated to the remaining holders of Notes, pro rata based on the principal amount of the Notes then held by such holders. (b) Insufficient Authorized Shares. If at any time while any of the Notes or Separate Tranche Note remain outstanding the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved shares of Common Stock to satisfy its obligation to reserve for issuance upon conversion of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes at least a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Required Reserve Amount (an "AUTHORIZED SHARE FAILURE"), then the Company shall immediately take all action necessary to increase the Company's authorized shares of Common Stock to an amount sufficient to allow the Company to reserve the Required Reserve Amount for the Notes and Separate Tranche Note then outstanding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the date of the occurrence of an Authorized Share Failure, but in no event later than 60 days after the occurrence of such Authorized Share Failure, the Company shall hold a meeting of its shareholders for the approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock. In connection with such meeting, the Company shall provide each shareholder with a proxy statement and shall use its best efforts to solicit its shareholders' approval of such increase 14
in authorized shares of Common Stock and to cause its board of directors to recommend to the shareholders that they approve such proposal. (10) REDEMPTION. (a) Mechanics. In the event that the Holder has sent a Redemption Notice to the Company pursuant to Section 4(b) or Section 5(c), the Holder shall promptly submit this Note to the Company. The Company shall deliver the applicable Event of Default Redemption Price to the Holder within five Business Days after the Company's receipt of the Holder's Event of Default Redemption Notice and thereafter the Holder shall promptly deliver this Note to the Company. If the Holder has submitted a Change of Control Redemption Notice in accordance with Section 5(c), the Company shall deliver the applicable Change of Control Redemption Price to the Holder concurrently with the consummation of such Change of Control if such notice is received prior to the consummation of such Change of Control and within five Business Days after the Company's receipt of such notice otherwise. In the event of a redemption of less than all of the Conversion Amount of this Note, the Company shall promptly cause to be issued and delivered to the Holder a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) representing the outstanding Principal which has not been redeemed. In the event that the Company does not pay the Redemption Price to the Holder within the time period required above in this Section 10(a) at any time thereafter and until the Company pays such unpaid Redemption Price in full, the Holder shall have the option to, in lieu of redemption, require the Company to promptly return to the Holder all or any portion of this Note representing the Conversion Amount that was submitted for redemption and for which the applicable Redemption Price (together with any Late Charges thereon) has not been paid. Upon the Company's receipt of such notice, (x) the Redemption Notice shall be null and void with respect to such Conversion Amount, (y) the Company shall immediately return this Note, or issue a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) to the Holder representing such Conversion Amount and (z) the Conversion Price of this Note or such new Notes shall be adjusted to the lesser of (A) the Conversion Price as in effect on the date on which the Redemption Notice is voided and (B) the lowest Closing Bid Price during the period beginning on and including the date on which the Redemption Notice is delivered to the Company and ending on and including the date on which the Redemption Notice is voided. The Holder's delivery of a notice voiding a Redemption Notice and exercise of its rights following such notice shall not affect the Company's obligations to make any payments of Late Charges which have accrued prior to the date of such notice with respect to the Conversion Amount subject to such notice. (b) Redemption by Other Holders. Upon the Company's receipt of notice from any of the holders of the Other Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes for redemption or repayment as a result of an event or occurrence substantially similar to the events or occurrences described in Section 4(b) or Section 5(c) (each an "OTHER REDEMPTION NOTICE"), the Company shall immediately forward to the Holder by facsimile a copy of such notice. If the Company receives a Redemption Notice and one or more Other Redemption Notices during the seven Business Day period beginning on and including the date which is three Business Days prior to the Company's receipt of the Holder's Redemption Notice and ending on and including the date which is three Business Days after the Company's receipt of the Holder's Redemption Notice and the Company is unable to redeem all principal, interest and other amounts designated 15
in such Redemption Notice and such Other Redemption Notices received during such seven Business Day period, then the Company shall redeem a pro rata amount from each holder of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes (including the Holder) based on the principal amount of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes submitted for redemption pursuant to such Redemption Notice and such Other Redemption Notices received by the Company during such seven Business Day period. (11) RESTRICTION ON REDEMPTION. Until all of the Notes have been converted, redeemed or otherwise satisfied in accordance with their terms, the Company shall not, directly or indirectly, redeem its capital stock without the prior express written consent of the holders of Notes representing at least two-thirds of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this Note, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of Section 3(c)(iii) and this Section 18(a), following conversion or redemption of any portion of this Note, the outstanding Principal represented by this Note may be less than the Principal stated on the face of this Note.

This Convertible Note (including all Convertible Notes issued in exchange, transfer or replacement hereof, this "NOTE") is one of an issue of Convertible Notes (collectively, the "NOTES" and such other Convertible Notes, the "OTHER NOTES") issued on the Issuance Date pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement (as defined below). Certain capitalized terms are defined in Section 28 and terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth for such terms in the Securities Purchase Agreement.
(1) MATURITY. On the Final Maturity Date, the Holder shall surrender this Note to the Company and the Company shall pay to the Holder an amount in cash representing all outstanding Principal, accrued and unpaid Interest and accrued and unpaid Late Charges (as defined in Section 24(b)), if any. The "MATURITY DATE" shall be the date that is 364 days after the Issuance Date; provided that, if the Holder has given notice in writing to the Company of its desire to extend the Maturity Date on or prior to the date that is 10 Business Days prior to the Maturity Date, the Maturity Date shall be extended (on one or more occasions) for an additional 364 days; provided, further, that the Maturity Date shall not be extended (except as provided in the following proviso) to more than five years after the Issuance Date (such date that is five years after the Issuance Date or such earlier Maturity Date prior to which the Holder has not requested an extension thereof, the "FINAL MATURITY DATE"); and provided, further, that the Final Maturity Date may be extended at the option of the Holder (x) in the event that, and for so long as, an Event of Default (as defined in Section 4(a)) shall have occurred and be continuing or any event shall have occurred and be continuing which with the passage of time and the failure to cure would result in an Event of Default and (y) through the date that is ten days after a Change of Control Termination Date in the event that the Announcement Date giving rise to such Change of Control Termination Date occurred prior to the Final Maturity Date. (2) INTEREST; INTEREST RATE. Interest on this Note shall commence accruing on the Issuance Date and shall be computed on the basis of the actual days elapsed during any period, and a calendar year of 365 or 366 calendar days, as applicable, and shall be payable in cash on each May 1 and each November 1 during the period beginning on the Issuance Date and ending on, and including, the Final Maturity Date (each an "INTEREST DATE"); provided that interest on any Conversion Amount of this Note that is accrued but unpaid as of the Conversion Date of such Conversion Amount shall be paid in shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate. From and after the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in Section 4(a)) or the failure to deliver timely the Non-Consolidation Opinion (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement) pursuant to Section 4(f) of the Securities Purchase Agreement (the "NRG OPINION"), the Interest Rate shall be increased by two percentage points (2%). In the event that such Event of Default is subsequently cured, the adjustment referred to in the preceding sentence shall cease to be effective as of the date of such cure; provided that the Interest as calculated at such increased rate during the continuance of such Event of Default shall continue to apply to the extent relating to the days after the occurrence of such Event of Default through and including the date of cure of such Event of Default. If the Company shall fail to credit the Holder's balance account with DTC (as defined in Section 3(c)(i)) or, if requested in writing by the Holder, to issue a certificate to the Holder for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled upon conversion of any Conversion Amount or to issue a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) representing the Principal portion of the Conversion Amount (as defined in Section 3(b)(i)) to which the Holder is entitled, in each case within the time periods set out in Section 3(c)(i) (in each case, a "CONVERSION FAILURE"), then during each period beginning on and including the date of each such Conversion Failure and ending on and including the date such Conversion Failure is cured, the Interest Rate then in effect shall be increased by two percentage points (2%). If (i) the Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) covering all the Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) issuable upon conversion of this Note and required to be filed by 2
the Company pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement is not declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on or before the applicable Mandatory Effective Date (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) or (ii) on any day after such Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC that sales of all the Registrable Securities required to be included on such Registration Statement cannot be made (other than during an Allowable Grace Period (as defined in Section 3(t) of the Registration Rights Agreement) pursuant to such Registration Statement (including, without limitation, because of a failure to keep such Registration Statement effective, to disclose such information as is necessary for sales to be made pursuant to such Registration Statement or to register sufficient shares of Common Stock) (collectively with the event described in the immediately preceding clause (i), each a "REGISTRATION FAILURE"), then, as partial relief for the damages to any holder by reason of any such delay in or reduction of its ability to sell Registrable Securities (which remedy shall not be exclusive of any other remedies available at law or in equity) the Interest Rate then in effect shall be increased by two percentage points (2%) during each period beginning on and including the first date of each such Registration Failure and ending on and including the date such Registration Failure is cured. (3) CONVERSION OF NOTES. This Note shall be convertible into shares of the Common Stock, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 3. (a) Conversion Right. Subject to the provisions of Section 3(d), at any time or times on or after the Issuance Date, the Holder shall be entitled to convert any portion of the outstanding and unpaid Conversion Amount (as defined below) into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 3(c), at the Conversion Rate (as defined below). The Company shall not issue any fraction of a share of Common Stock upon any conversion. If the issuance would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of Common Stock, the Company shall round such fraction of a share of Common Stock up to the nearest whole share. The Company shall pay any and all taxes that may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of Common Stock upon conversion of any Conversion Amount. (b) Conversion Rate. The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any Conversion Amount pursuant to Section 3(a) shall be determined by dividing (x) such Conversion Amount by (y) the Conversion Price (as defined below) (the "CONVERSION RATE"). (i) "CONVERSION AMOUNT" means the sum of (A) the portion of the Principal to be converted, redeemed or otherwise surrendered with respect to which this determination is being made, (B) accrued and unpaid Interest with respect to such Principal and (C) accrued and unpaid Late Charges with respect to such Principal and Interest. (ii) "CONVERSION PRICE" means, 110% of the arithmetic average of the Weighted Average Price of the Common Stock during the 20 Trading Day period beginning 90 days after the issuance date of the First Notes, not to exceed the Weighted Average Price of the Common Stock during the 20 Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day that is immediately prior to the 90th day after the issuance date of the First Notes. 3
(c) Mechanics of Conversion. (i) Optional Conversion. To convert any Conversion Amount into shares of Common Stock on any date (a "CONVERSION DATE"), the Holder shall (A) transmit by facsimile (or otherwise deliver), for receipt on or prior to 11:59 p.m., Central Time on such date, a copy of an executed notice of conversion in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I (the "CONVERSION NOTICE") to the Company and (B) if required by Section 3(c)(ii), surrender this Note to a common carrier for delivery to the Company as soon as practicable on or following such date (or an indemnification undertaking with respect to this Note in the case of its loss, theft or destruction). On or before the first Business Day following the Company's receipt of a Conversion Notice, the Company shall transmit by facsimile a confirmation of receipt of such Conversion Notice to the Holder and the Transfer Agent (as defined below). On or before the second Business Day following the date of receipt of a Conversion Notice (the "SHARE DELIVERY DATE"), the Company shall (X) (if (Y) below does not apply) issue and deliver to the address as specified in the Conversion Notice, a certificate, registered in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled, or (Y) provided that the Company's transfer agent (the "TRANSFER AGENT") is participating in The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, upon the request of the Holder, credit such aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled to the Holder's or its designee's balance account with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission system. If this Note is physically surrendered for conversion as required by Section 3(c)(ii) and the outstanding Principal of this Note is greater than the Principal portion of the Conversion Amount being converted, then the Company shall as soon as practicable and in no event later than three Business Days after receipt of this Note (the "NOTE DELIVERY DATE") and at its own expense, issue and deliver to the holder a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) representing the outstanding Principal not converted. The person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon a conversion of this Note shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on the Conversion Date. (ii) Book-Entry. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of any portion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Company unless (A) the full Conversion Amount represented by this Note is being converted or (B) the Holder has provided the Company with prior written notice (which notice may be included in a Conversion Notice) requesting physical surrender and reissue of this Note. The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the Principal and Interest converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon conversion. (iii) Pro Rata Conversion; Disputes. In the event that the Company receives a Conversion Notice from more than one holder of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes for the same Conversion Date and the Company can convert some, but not all, of such 4
portions of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes submitted for conversion, the Company, subject to Section 3(d), shall convert from each holder of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes electing to have the Notes or Separate Tranche Notes converted on such date a pro rata amount of such holder's portion of its Notes or Separate Tranche Notes submitted for conversion based on the principal amount of the Notes or Separate Tranche Notes submitted for conversion on such date by such holder relative to the aggregate principal amount of all the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes submitted for conversion on such date. In the event of a dispute as to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable to the Holder in connection with a conversion of this Note, the Company shall issue to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock not in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 23. (d) Limitations on Conversions. (i) Beneficial Ownership. The Company shall not effect any conversion of this Note, and the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to convert any portion of this Note pursuant to Section 3(a), to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion, the Holder (together with the Holder's affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 5.0% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note with respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (A) conversion of the remaining, nonconverted portion of this Note beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its affiliates and (B) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any Other Notes, Separate Tranche Notes or warrants) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its affiliates. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 3(d)(i), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. For purposes of this Section 3(d)(i), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (x) the Company's most recent Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (z) any other notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of the Holder, the Company shall within one Business Day confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Note, by the Holder or its affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. (ii) Principal Market Regulation. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Note if the issuance of such shares of Common 5
Stock would exceed that number of shares of Common Stock which the Company may issue pursuant to the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes without breaching the Company's obligations under the rules or regulations of the Principal Market (the "EXCHANGE CAP"), except that such limitation shall not apply in the event that the Company (A) obtains the approval of its shareholders as required by the applicable rules of the Principal Market for issuances of Common Stock in excess of such amount or (B) obtains a written opinion from outside counsel to the Company that such approval is not required, which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the holders of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes representing a majority of the principal amounts of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes (voting as a single class) then outstanding. Until such approval or written opinion is obtained, no purchaser of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement (the "PURCHASERS") shall be issued, upon conversion of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes, shares of Common Stock in an amount greater than the product of the Exchange Cap multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the principal amount of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes issued to such Purchaser pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement as of the date of such determination and the denominator of which is the aggregate principal amount of all the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes issued to the Purchasers pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement as of the date of such determination (with respect to each Purchaser, the "EXCHANGE CAP ALLOCATION"). In the event that any Purchaser shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such Purchaser's Notes or Separate Tranche Notes, the transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such Purchaser's Exchange Cap Allocation, and the restrictions of the prior sentence shall apply to such transferee with respect to the portion of the Exchange Cap Allocation allocated to such transferee. In the event that any holder of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes shall convert all of such holder's Notes or Separate Tranche Notes into a number of shares of Common Stock which, in the aggregate, is less than such holder's Exchange Cap Allocation, then the difference between such holder's Exchange Cap Allocation and the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued to such holder shall be allocated to the respective Exchange Cap Allocations of the remaining holders of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes on a pro rata basis in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes then held by each such holder. (4) RIGHTS UPON EVENT OF DEFAULT. (a) Event of Default. Each of the following events shall constitute a "EVENT OF DEFAULT": (i) the failure of the Registration Statement covering all Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) required to be registered pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement to be declared effective by the SEC on or prior to the date that is 180 days after the Issuance Date, or, while such Registration Statement is required to be maintained effective pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, the effectiveness of such Registration Statement lapses for any reason (including, without limitation, the issuance of a stop order) or is unavailable to any holder of the Notes for sale of all of such holder's Registrable Securities in accordance with the terms of the 6
Registration Rights Agreement, and such lapse or unavailability continues for a period of five consecutive Business Days or for more than an aggregate of 20 Business Days in any 365-day period; (ii) the suspension from trading on the Principal Market for a period of three consecutive Business Days or for more than an aggregate of three Business Days in any 30-day Trading Day period or the delisting of the Common Stock from the Principal Market; (iii) the Company's (A) failure to cure a Conversion Failure by delivery of the required number of shares of Common Stock or a new Note (in accordance with section 17(d)), as applicable, within 10 days after the receipt by the Company of a Conversion Notice or (B) notice, written or oral, to any holder of the Notes, including by way of public announcement or through any of its agents, at any time, of its intention not to comply with a request for conversion of any Notes into shares of Common Stock that is tendered in accordance with the provisions of the Notes; (iv) the Company's failure to pay to the Holder any amount of Principal, Interest, Late Charges or other amounts when and as due under this Note, the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement or any other agreement, document, certificate or other instrument delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby to which the Holder is a party; (v) any default under, redemption of or acceleration prior to maturity of any Indebtedness (as defined in Section 3(r) of the Securities Purchase Agreement) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 3(a) of the Securities Purchase Agreement) other than NRG (as defined below) (including, without limitation, the Other Notes) of at least $50,000,000; (vi) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than NRG (as defined below), pursuant to or within the meaning of Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar Federal or state law for the relief of debtors (collectively, "BANKRUPTCY LAW"), (A) commences a voluntary case, (B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case, (C) consents to the appointment of a receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator or similar official (a "CUSTODIAN"), (D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors or (E) admits in writing that it is generally unable to pay its debts as they become due; (vii) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that (A) is for relief against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than NRG (as defined below) in an involuntary case, (B) appoints a Custodian of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than NRG (as defined below) or (C) orders the liquidation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than NRG (as defined below); or (viii) the Company breaches any representation, warranty, covenant (other than any covenant to deliver the NRG Opinion) or other term or condition of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement, this Note or any other 7
agreement, document, certificate or other instrument delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby and hereby to which the Holder is a party, except, in the case of a breach of a covenant which is curable, only if such breach continues for a period of at least 10 consecutive days. (b) Redemption Right. Promptly after the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to this Note or the Other Notes, the Company shall deliver written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier (a "EVENT OF DEFAULT NOTICE") to the Holder. At any time after the earlier of the Holder's receipt of an Event of Default Notice and the Holder becoming aware of an Event of Default, the Holder may require the Company to redeem all or any portion of this Note by delivering written notice thereof (the "EVENT OF DEFAULT REDEMPTION NOTICE") to the Company, which Event of Default Redemption Notice shall indicate the portion of this Note the Holder is electing to redeem. Each portion of this Note subject to redemption by the Company pursuant to this Section 4(b) shall be redeemed by the Company at a price equal to the greater of (i) the product of (x) the Conversion Amount and (y) the quotient determined by dividing (A) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock immediately prior to such Event of Default by (B) the Conversion Price and (ii) the product of (x) the Conversion Amount and (y) the Redemption Premium (the "EVENT OF DEFAULT REDEMPTION PRICE"). Redemptions required by this Section 4(b) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 10. (5) RIGHTS UPON CHANGE OF CONTROL. (a) Change of Control. Each of the following events shall constitute a "CHANGE OF CONTROL": (i) the consolidation, merger or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization or recapitalization) of the Company with or into another Person in which holders of the Company's voting power immediately prior to the transaction cease after the transaction to hold, directly or indirectly, a majority of the voting power of the surviving entity or entities or the voting power necessary to elect a majority of the members of the board of directors (or their equivalent if other than a corporation) of such entity or entities; (ii) the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Company's assets; or (iii) a purchase, tender or exchange offer made to and accepted by the holders of more than the 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. (b) Assumption. Prior to the consummation of any Change of Control, the Company will secure from any Person purchasing the Company's assets or Common Stock or any successor resulting from such Change of Control (in each case, an "ACQUIRING ENTITY") a written agreement (in form and substance satisfactory to the holders of Notes representing a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding) to deliver to each holder of Notes in exchange for such Notes, a security of the Acquiring Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to the Notes, including, without limitation, having a principal amount and interest rate equal to the principal amounts and the 8
interest rates of the Notes held by such holder, and satisfactory to the holders of Notes representing a majority of the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. In the event that an Acquiring Entity is directly or indirectly controlled by a company or entity whose common stock or similar equity interest is listed, designated or quoted on a securities exchange or trading market, the holders of notes representing a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may elect to treat such Person as the Acquiring Entity for purposes of this Section 5(b). (c) Redemption Right. No sooner than 15 days nor later than 10 days prior to the consummation of a Change of Control, but not prior to the public announcement of such Change of Control, the Company shall deliver written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier to the Holder (a "CHANGE OF CONTROL NOTICE"). At any time on or after consummation of such Change of Control, the Holder may require the Company to redeem all or any portion of this Note by delivering written notice thereof ("CHANGE OF CONTROL REDEMPTION NOTICE" and, collectively with an Event of Default Redemption Notice, "REDEMPTION NOTICES" and, individually, each a "REDEMPTION NOTICE") to the Company, which Change of Control Redemption Notice shall indicate the Conversion Amount the Holder is electing to redeem. The portion of this Note subject to redemption pursuant to this Section 5(c) shall be redeemed by the Company at a price equal to the greater of (i) the product of (x) the Conversion Amount and (y) the quotient determined by dividing (A) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock immediately following the public announcement of such proposed Change of Control by (B) the Conversion Price and (ii) 115% of the Conversion Amount (the "CHANGE OF CONTROL REDEMPTION PRICE" and, together with the Event of Default Redemption Price, the "REDEMPTION PRICE"). Redemptions required by this Section 5(c) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 and shall have priority to payments to other shareholders in connection with a Change of Control. (6) RIGHTS UPON ISSUANCE OF PURCHASE RIGHTS AND OTHER CORPORATE EVENTS. (a) Purchase Rights. If at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of Common Stock (the "PURCHASE RIGHTS"), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of this Note) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights. (b) Other Corporate Events. Prior to the consummation of any recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation, merger or other business combination (other than a Change of Control) pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock (a "CORPORATE 9
EVENT"), the Company shall make appropriate provision to insure that the Holder will thereafter have the right to receive upon a conversion of this Note, (i) in addition to the shares of Common Stock receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets to which the Holder would have been entitled with respect to such shares of Common Stock had such shares of Common Stock been held by the Holder upon the consummation of such Corporate Event or (ii) in lieu of the shares of Common Stock otherwise receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets received by the holders of Common Stock in connection with the consummation of such Corporate Event in such amounts as the Holder would have been entitled to receive had this Note initially been issued with conversion rights for the form of such consideration (as opposed to shares of Common Stock) at a conversion rate for such consideration commensurate with the Conversion Rate. Provision made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be in a form and substance satisfactory to the holders of Notes representing a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. (7) RIGHTS UPON ISSUANCE OF OTHER SECURITIES. (a) Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Issuance of Common Stock. If and whenever on or after the issuance date of the First Notes, the Company issues or sells, or in accordance with this Section 7(a) is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of Common Stock (including the issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock owned or held by or for the account of the Company, but excluding shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold by the Company (I) in connection with the Xcel Energy Direct Purchase Plan or any employee benefit plan which has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, pursuant to which the Company's securities may be issued to any employee, officer or director for services provided to the Company or its Subsidiaries (each, an "APPROVED STOCK PLAN") or (II) upon conversion of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes) for a consideration per share less than the higher of the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the date of such issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale and the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale (such higher price is referred to herein as the "APPLICABLE PRICE"), then immediately after such issue or sale (subject to Section 7(a)(vi)), the Conversion Price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to the product of (x) the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale or deemed issuance or sale and (y) the quotient determined by dividing (1) the sum of the product of the Applicable Price and the number of shares of Common Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale or deemed issue or sale and the consideration, if any, received by the Company upon such issue or sale, by (2) the product of the Applicable Price multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately after such issue or sale or deemed issue or sale. For purposes of determining the adjusted Conversion Price under this Section 7(a), the following shall be applicable: (i) Issuance of Options. If the Company in any manner grants or sells any Options and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of such Option is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the granting or sale of such Option for such price 10
per share. For purposes of this Section 7(a)(i), the "lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of such Option" shall be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon granting or sale of the Option, upon exercise of the Option and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon exercise of such Option. No further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock or of such Convertible Securities upon the exercise of such Options or upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities. If the Company issues or sells any Options which are Variable Securities, no adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made pursuant to this Section 7(a), and no shares of Common Stock shall be deemed outstanding with respect to such Variable Securities, as a result of the issuance of such Variable Securities until the actual issuance of Common Stock or Convertible Securities upon exercise of such Variable Securities, except to the extent such Variable Security also includes as a component of the exercise price a price which does not vary with the market price of the Common Stock. (ii) Issuance of Convertible Securities. If the Company in any manner issues or sells any Convertible Securities and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion, exercise or exchange thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the issuance of sale of such Convertible Securities for such price per share. For the purposes of this Section 7(a)(ii), the "price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion, exercise or exchange" shall be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the issuance or sale of the Convertible Security and upon the conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Security. No further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities, and if any such issue or sale of such Convertible Securities is made upon exercise of any Options for which adjustment of the Conversion Price had been or are to be made pursuant to other provisions of this Section 7(a), no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made by reason of such issue or sale. If the Company issues or sells any Convertible Securities which are Variable Securities, no adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made pursuant to this Section 7(a), and no shares of Common Stock shall be deemed outstanding with respect to such Variable Security, as a result of the issuance of such Variable Securities until the actual issuance of Common Stock upon exercise of such Variable Securities, except to the extent such Variable Security also includes as a component of the conversion, exercise or exchange price a price which does not vary with the market price of the Common Stock. (iii) Change in Option Price or Rate of Conversion. If the purchase price provided for in any Options, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issue, conversion or 11
exchange of any Convertible Securities, or the rate at which any Convertible Securities are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock changes at any time, the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such change shall be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been in effect at such time had such Options or Convertible Securities provided for such changed purchase price, additional consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold. For purposes of this Section 7(a)(iii), if the terms of any Option or Convertible Security that was outstanding as of the Issuance Date are changed in the manner described in the immediately preceding sentence, then such Option or Convertible Security and the Common Stock deemed issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such change. No adjustment shall be made if such adjustment would result in an increase of the Conversion Price then in effect. (iv) Calculation of Consideration Received. In case any Option is issued in connection with the issue or sale of other securities of the Company, together comprising one integrated transaction in which no specific consideration is allocated to such Options by the parties thereto, the Options will be deemed to have been issued for a consideration of $.01. If any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor will be deemed to be the net amount received by the Company therefor. If any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the Company will be the fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of securities, in which case the amount of consideration received by the Company will be the Closing Sale Price of such securities on the date of receipt. If any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the Company is the surviving entity, the amount of consideration therefor will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to such Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, as the case may be. The fair value of any consideration other than cash or securities will be determined jointly by the Company and the holders of Notes representing a majority of the principal amounts of the Notes then outstanding. If such parties are unable to reach agreement within ten days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the "VALUATION EVENT"), the fair value of such consideration will be determined within five Business Days after the tenth day following the Valuation Event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly selected by the Company and the holders of Notes representing a majority of the principal amounts of the Notes then outstanding. The determination of such appraiser shall be deemed binding upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the Company. (v) Record Date. If the Company takes a record of the holders of Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (A) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in Common Stock, Options or in Convertible Securities or (B) to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date will be deemed 12
to be the date of the issue or sale of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. (vi) Common Stock Deemed Outstanding. "COMMON STOCK DEEMED OUTSTANDING" means, at any given time, the number of shares of Common Stock actually outstanding at such time, plus the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be outstanding pursuant to Sections 7(a)(i) and 7(a)(ii) hereof regardless of whether the Options or Convertible Securities are actually exercisable at such time, but excluding any shares of Common Stock owned or held by or for the account of the Company or issuable upon conversion of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes. (vii) Delayed Adjustment. In addition to the foregoing provisions of this Section 7(a), the Weighted Average Price, Closing Sales Price and Closing Bid Price shall be subject to adjustment, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, for any days during any measuring period, including, without limitation, the Tranche A Pricing Period, used herein that occur prior to any of the aforementioned events if such events occur prior to the end of such measuring period. (b) Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock. If the Company at any time subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. If the Company at any time combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased. (c) Other Events. If any event occurs of the type contemplated by the provisions of this Section 7 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then the Company's Board of Directors will make an appropriate adjustment in the Conversion Price so as to protect the rights of the Holder under this Note; provided that no such adjustment will increase the Conversion Price as otherwise determined pursuant to this Section 7. (8) NONCIRCUMVENTION. The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Articles of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of, or enter into any agreement which by its terms restricts or otherwise impairs the Company's performance of the terms of, this Note or any of the other Transaction Documents (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement), and will at all times in good faith carry out all of the provisions of this Note and take all action as may be required to protect the rights of the Holder of this Note. 13
(9) RESERVATION OF AUTHORIZED SHARES. (a) Reservation. The Company shall initially reserve out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock a number of shares of Common Stock for each of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes equal to 115% of the Conversion Rate with respect to the Conversion Amount of each such Note and Separate Tranche Note. Thereafter, the Company shall, so long as any of the Notes or Separate Tranche Notes are outstanding, take all action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Notes and Separate Tranche Note, at least 100% of the number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion of all of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes then outstanding; provided that at no time shall the number of shares of Common Stock so reserved be less than the number of shares required to be reserved by the previous sentence (without regard to any limitations on conversions) (the "REQUIRED RESERVE AMOUNT"). The initial number of shares of Common Stock reserved for conversions of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Note and each increase in the number of shares so reserved shall be allocated pro rata among the holders of the Notes and Separate Tranche Note based on the principal amount of the Notes and Separate Tranche Notes held by each holder at the time of Issuance Date or increase in the number of reserved shares, as the case may be (the "AUTHORIZED SHARE ALLOCATION"). In the event that a holder shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such holder's Notes, each transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such holder's Authorized Share Allocation. Any shares of Common Stock reserved and allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Notes shall be allocated to the remaining holders of Notes, pro rata based on the principal amount of the Notes then held by such holders. (b) Insufficient Authorized Shares. If at any time while any of the Notes or Separate Tranche Note remain outstanding the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved shares of Common Stock to satisfy its obligation to reserve for issuance upon conversion of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes at least a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Required Reserve Amount (an "AUTHORIZED SHARE FAILURE"), then the Company shall immediately take all action necessary to increase the Company's authorized shares of Common Stock to an amount sufficient to allow the Company to reserve the Required Reserve Amount for the Notes and Separate Tranche Note then outstanding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the date of the occurrence of an Authorized Share Failure, but in no event later than 60 days after the occurrence of such Authorized Share Failure, the Company shall hold a meeting of its shareholders for the approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock. In connection with such meeting, the Company shall provide each shareholder with a proxy statement and shall use its best efforts to solicit its shareholders' approval of such increase in authorized shares of Common Stock and to cause its board of directors to recommend to the shareholders that they approve such proposal. (10) REDEMPTION. (a) Mechanics. In the event that the Holder has sent a Redemption Notice to the Company pursuant to Section 4(b) or Section 5(c), the Holder shall promptly 14
submit this Note to the Company. The Company shall deliver the applicable Event of Default Redemption Price to the Holder within five Business Days after the Company's receipt of the Holder's Event of Default Redemption Notice and thereafter the Holder shall promptly deliver this Note to the Company. If the Holder has submitted a Change of Control Redemption Notice in accordance with Section 5(c), the Company shall deliver the applicable Change of Control Redemption Price to the Holder concurrently with the consummation of such Change of Control if such notice is received prior to the consummation of such Change of Control and within five Business Days after the Company's receipt of such notice otherwise. In the event of a redemption of less than all of the Conversion Amount of this Note, the Company shall promptly cause to be issued and delivered to the Holder a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) representing the outstanding Principal which has not been redeemed. In the event that the Company does not pay the Redemption Price to the Holder within the time period required above in this Section 10(a) at any time thereafter and until the Company pays such unpaid Redemption Price in full, the Holder shall have the option to, in lieu of redemption, require the Company to promptly return to the Holder all or any portion of this Note representing the Conversion Amount that was submitted for redemption and for which the applicable Redemption Price (together with any Late Charges thereon) has not been paid. Upon the Company's receipt of such notice, (x) the Redemption Notice shall be null and void with respect to such Conversion Amount, (y) the Company shall immediately return this Note, or issue a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) to the Holder representing such Conversion Amount and (z) the Conversion Price of this Note or such new Notes shall be adjusted to the lesser of (A) the Conversion Price as in effect on the date on which the Redemption Notice is voided and (B) the lowest Closing Bid Price during the period beginning on and including the date on which the Redemption Notice is delivered to the Company and ending on and including the date on which the Redemption Notice is voided. The Holder's delivery of a notice voiding a Redemption Notice and exercise of its rights following such notice shall not affect the Company's obligations to make any payments of Late Charges which have accrued prior to the date of such notice with respect to the Conversion Amount subject to such notice. (b) Redemption by Other Holders. Upon the Company's receipt of notice from any of the holders of the Other Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes for redemption or repayment as a result of an event or occurrence substantially similar to the events or occurrences described in Section 4(b) or Section 5(c) (each an "OTHER REDEMPTION NOTICE"), the Company shall immediately forward to the Holder by facsimile a copy of such notice. If the Company receives a Redemption Notice and one or more Other Redemption Notices during the seven Business Day period beginning on and including the date which is three Business Days prior to the Company's receipt of the Holder's Redemption Notice and ending on and including the date which is three Business Days after the Company's receipt of the Holder's Redemption Notice and the Company is unable to redeem all principal, interest and other amounts designated in such Redemption Notice and such Other Redemption Notices received during such seven Business Day period, then the Company shall redeem a pro rata amount from each holder of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes (including the Holder) based on the principal amount of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes submitted for redemption pursuant to such Redemption Notice and such Other Redemption Notices received by the Company during such seven Business Day period. 15
(11) RESTRICTION ON REDEMPTION. Until all of the Notes have been converted, redeemed or otherwise satisfied in accordance with their terms, the Company shall not, directly or indirectly, redeem its capital stock without the prior express written consent of the holders of Notes representing at least two-thirds of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. (12) SUBORDINATION; ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS.

"Permitted Indebtedness" shall mean any Indebtedness that is unsecured and is not senior in right of payment to the Notes and is otherwise on terms that are no more favorable to the holders thereof than the terms of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes unless such more favorable terms are offered to the Holders. (b) Liens. The Company shall not create, incur, assume or suffer to exist, or permit any of its Subsidiaries (other than NRG Energy Inc. or its subsidiaries (collectively, "NRG")) to create, incur, assume or suffer to exist, any Lien upon or with respect to any of its properties, whether now owned or hereafter acquired; sign or suffer to exist any security agreement authorizing any secured party thereunder to file a Uniform Commercial Code financing statement (or the equivalent thereof) as notice of a Lien on any property of the Company or its Subsidiaries; sell any of its property or assets subject to an understanding or agreement, contingent or otherwise, to repurchase such property or assets (including sales of accounts receivable) with recourse to it or any of its Subsidiaries or assign or otherwise transfer, or permit any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Existing Utility Subsidiaries (as defined in the Bank Facility)) to assign or otherwise transfer, any account or other right to receive income; other than, as to all of the above, Permitted Liens.

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, effect any transaction with any Affiliate (as defined in the Bank Facility) that is (a) outside the ordinary course of business or (b) on a basis less favorable than would at the time be obtainable for a comparable transaction in arms-length dealing with an unrelated third party, provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, no loan, payment or other form of contribution shall be made to NRG unless it is in an amount not in excess of (i) $300 Million payable pursuant to the Support Agreement and Capital Subscription Agreement, dated as of May 29, 2002, by and between the Company and NRG Energy Inc. and (ii) $250 Million in respect of guarantee obligations relating to the power marketing business of NRG; provided further that with respect to any payment permitted pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Company shall, in the context of a restructuring of NRG, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain a full release of all obligations and liabilities of the Company relating to NRG.

This Convertible Note (including all Convertible Notes issued in exchange, transfer or replacement hereof, this "NOTE") is one of an issue of Convertible Notes (collectively, the "NOTES" and such other Convertible Notes, the "OTHER NOTES") issued on the Issuance Date pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement (as defined below). Certain capitalized terms are defined in Section 28 and terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth for such terms in the Securities Purchase Agreement.
(1) MATURITY. On the Final Maturity Date, the Holder shall surrender this Note to the Company and the Company shall pay to the Holder an amount in cash representing all outstanding Principal, accrued and unpaid Interest and accrued and unpaid Late Charges (as defined in Section 24(b)), if any. The "MATURITY DATE" shall be the date that is 364 days after the Issuance Date; provided that, if the Holder has given notice in writing to the Company of its desire to extend the Maturity Date on or prior to the date that is 10 Business Days prior to the Maturity Date, the Maturity Date shall be extended (on one or more occasions) for an additional 364 days; provided, further, that the Maturity Date shall not be extended (except as provided in the following proviso) to more than five years after the Issuance Date (such date that is five years after the Issuance Date or such earlier Maturity Date prior to which the Holder has not requested an extension thereof, the "FINAL MATURITY DATE"); and provided, further, that the Final Maturity Date may be extended at the option of the Holder (x) in the event that, and for so long as, an Event of Default (as defined in Section 4(a)) shall have occurred and be continuing or any event shall have occurred and be continuing which with the passage of time and the failure to cure would result in an Event of Default and (y) through the date that is ten days after a Change of Control Termination Date in the event that the Announcement Date giving rise to such Change of Control Termination Date occurred prior to the Final Maturity Date. (2) INTEREST; INTEREST RATE. Interest on this Note shall commence accruing on the Issuance Date and shall be computed on the basis of the actual days elapsed during any period, and a calendar year of 365 or 366 calendar days, as applicable, and shall be payable in cash on each May 1 and each November 1 during the period beginning on the Issuance Date and ending on, and including, the Final Maturity Date (each an "INTEREST DATE"); provided that interest on any Conversion Amount of this Note that is accrued but unpaid as of the Conversion Date of such Conversion Amount shall be paid in shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate. From and after the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in Section 4(a)) or the failure to deliver timely the Non-Consolidation Opinion (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement) pursuant to Section 4(f) of the Securities Purchase Agreement (the "NRG OPINION"), the Interest Rate shall be increased by two percentage points (2%). In the event that such Event of Default is subsequently cured, the adjustment referred to in the preceding sentence shall cease to be effective as of the date of such cure; provided that the Interest as calculated at such increased rate during the continuance of such Event of Default shall continue to apply to the extent relating to the days after the occurrence of such Event of Default through and including the date of cure of such Event of Default. If the Company shall fail to credit the Holder's balance account with DTC (as defined in Section 3(c)(i)) or, if requested in writing by the Holder, to issue a certificate to the Holder for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled upon conversion of any Conversion Amount or to issue a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) representing the Principal portion of the Conversion Amount (as defined in Section 3(b)(i)) to which the Holder is entitled, in each case within the time periods set out in Section 3(c)(i) (in each case, a "CONVERSION FAILURE"), then during each period beginning on and including the date of each such Conversion Failure and ending on and including the date such Conversion Failure is cured, the Interest Rate then in effect shall be increased by two percentage points (2%). If (i) the Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) covering all the Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) issuable upon conversion of this Note and required to be filed by 2
the Company pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement is not declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on or before the applicable Mandatory Effective Date (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) or (ii) on any day after such Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC that sales of all the Registrable Securities required to be included on such Registration Statement cannot be made (other than during an Allowable Grace Period (as defined in Section 3(t) of the Registration Rights Agreement) pursuant to such Registration Statement (including, without limitation, because of a failure to keep such Registration Statement effective, to disclose such information as is necessary for sales to be made pursuant to such Registration Statement or to register sufficient shares of Common Stock) (collectively with the event described in the immediately preceding clause (i), each a "REGISTRATION FAILURE"), then, as partial relief for the damages to any holder by reason of any such delay in or reduction of its ability to sell Registrable Securities (which remedy shall not be exclusive of any other remedies available at law or in equity) the Interest Rate then in effect shall be increased by two percentage points (2%) during each period beginning on and including the first date of each such Registration Failure and ending on and including the date such Registration Failure is cured. (3) CONVERSION OF NOTES. This Note shall be convertible into shares of the Common Stock, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 3. (a) Conversion Right. Subject to the provisions of Section 3(d), at any time or times on or after the Issuance Date, the Holder shall be entitled to convert any portion of the outstanding and unpaid Conversion Amount (as defined below) into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 3(c), at the Conversion Rate (as defined below). The Company shall not issue any fraction of a share of Common Stock upon any conversion. If the issuance would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of Common Stock, the Company shall round such fraction of a share of Common Stock up to the nearest whole share. The Company shall pay any and all taxes that may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of Common Stock upon conversion of any Conversion Amount. (b) Conversion Rate. The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any Conversion Amount pursuant to Section 3(a) shall be determined by dividing (x) such Conversion Amount by (y) the Conversion Price (as defined below) (the "CONVERSION RATE"). (i) "CONVERSION AMOUNT" means the sum of (A) the portion of the Principal to be converted, redeemed or otherwise surrendered with respect to which this determination is being made, (B) accrued and unpaid Interest with respect to such Principal and (C) accrued and unpaid Late Charges with respect to such Principal and Interest. (ii) "CONVERSION PRICE" means, 110% of the arithmetic average of the Weighted Average Price of the Common Stock during the 20 Trading Day period beginning 90 days after the issuance date of the First Notes, not to exceed the Weighted Average Price of the Common Stock during the 20 Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day that is immediately prior to the 90th day after the issuance date of the First Notes. 3
(c) Mechanics of Conversion. (i) Optional Conversion. To convert any Conversion Amount into shares of Common Stock on any date (a "CONVERSION DATE"), the Holder shall (A) transmit by facsimile (or otherwise deliver), for receipt on or prior to 11:59 p.m., Central Time on such date, a copy of an executed notice of conversion in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I (the "CONVERSION NOTICE") to the Company and (B) if required by Section 3(c)(ii), surrender this Note to a common carrier for delivery to the Company as soon as practicable on or following such date (or an indemnification undertaking with respect to this Note in the case of its loss, theft or destruction). On or before the first Business Day following the Company's receipt of a Conversion Notice, the Company shall transmit by facsimile a confirmation of receipt of such Conversion Notice to the Holder and the Transfer Agent (as defined below). On or before the second Business Day following the date of receipt of a Conversion Notice (the "SHARE DELIVERY DATE"), the Company shall (X) (if (Y) below does not apply) issue and deliver to the address as specified in the Conversion Notice, a certificate, registered in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled, or (Y) provided that the Company's transfer agent (the "TRANSFER AGENT") is participating in The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, upon the request of the Holder, credit such aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled to the Holder's or its designee's balance account with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission system. If this Note is physically surrendered for conversion as required by Section 3(c)(ii) and the outstanding Principal of this Note is greater than the Principal portion of the Conversion Amount being converted, then the Company shall as soon as practicable and in no event later than three Business Days after receipt of this Note (the "NOTE DELIVERY DATE") and at its own expense, issue and deliver to the holder a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) representing the outstanding Principal not converted. The person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon a conversion of this Note shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on the Conversion Date. (ii) Book-Entry. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of any portion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Company unless (A) the full Conversion Amount represented by this Note is being converted or (B) the Holder has provided the Company with prior written notice (which notice may be included in a Conversion Notice) requesting physical surrender and reissue of this Note. The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the Principal and Interest converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon conversion. (iii) Pro Rata Conversion; Disputes. In the event that the Company receives a Conversion Notice from more than one holder of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes for the same Conversion Date and the Company can convert some, but not all, of such 4
portions of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes submitted for conversion, the Company, subject to Section 3(d), shall convert from each holder of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes electing to have the Notes or Separate Tranche Notes converted on such date a pro rata amount of such holder's portion of its Notes or Separate Tranche Notes submitted for conversion based on the principal amount of the Notes or Separate Tranche Notes submitted for conversion on such date by such holder relative to the aggregate principal amount of all the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes submitted for conversion on such date. In the event of a dispute as to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable to the Holder in connection with a conversion of this Note, the Company shall issue to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock not in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 23. (d) Limitations on Conversions. (i) Beneficial Ownership. The Company shall not effect any conversion of this Note, and the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to convert any portion of this Note pursuant to Section 3(a), to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion, the Holder (together with the Holder's affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 5.0% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note with respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (A) conversion of the remaining, nonconverted portion of this Note beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its affiliates and (B) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any Other Notes, Separate Tranche Notes or warrants) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its affiliates. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 3(d)(i), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. For purposes of this Section 3(d)(i), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (x) the Company's most recent Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (z) any other notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of the Holder, the Company shall within one Business Day confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Note, by the Holder or its affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. (ii) Principal Market Regulation. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Note if the issuance of such shares of Common 5
Stock would exceed that number of shares of Common Stock which the Company may issue pursuant to the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes without breaching the Company's obligations under the rules or regulations of the Principal Market (the "EXCHANGE CAP"), except that such limitation shall not apply in the event that the Company (A) obtains the approval of its shareholders as required by the applicable rules of the Principal Market for issuances of Common Stock in excess of such amount or (B) obtains a written opinion from outside counsel to the Company that such approval is not required, which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the holders of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes representing a majority of the principal amounts of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes (voting as a single class) then outstanding. Until such approval or written opinion is obtained, no purchaser of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement (the "PURCHASERS") shall be issued, upon conversion of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes, shares of Common Stock in an amount greater than the product of the Exchange Cap multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the principal amount of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes issued to such Purchaser pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement as of the date of such determination and the denominator of which is the aggregate principal amount of all the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes issued to the Purchasers pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement as of the date of such determination (with respect to each Purchaser, the "EXCHANGE CAP ALLOCATION"). In the event that any Purchaser shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such Purchaser's Notes or Separate Tranche Notes, the transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such Purchaser's Exchange Cap Allocation, and the restrictions of the prior sentence shall apply to such transferee with respect to the portion of the Exchange Cap Allocation allocated to such transferee. In the event that any holder of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes shall convert all of such holder's Notes or Separate Tranche Notes into a number of shares of Common Stock which, in the aggregate, is less than such holder's Exchange Cap Allocation, then the difference between such holder's Exchange Cap Allocation and the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued to such holder shall be allocated to the respective Exchange Cap Allocations of the remaining holders of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes on a pro rata basis in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes then held by each such holder. (4) RIGHTS UPON EVENT OF DEFAULT. (a) Event of Default. Each of the following events shall constitute a "EVENT OF DEFAULT": (i) the failure of the Registration Statement covering all Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) required to be registered pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement to be declared effective by the SEC on or prior to the date that is 180 days after the Issuance Date, or, while such Registration Statement is required to be maintained effective pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, the effectiveness of such Registration Statement lapses for any reason (including, without limitation, the issuance of a stop order) or is unavailable to any holder of the Notes for sale of all of such holder's Registrable Securities in accordance with the terms of the 6
Registration Rights Agreement, and such lapse or unavailability continues for a period of five consecutive Business Days or for more than an aggregate of 20 Business Days in any 365-day period; (ii) the suspension from trading on the Principal Market for a period of three consecutive Business Days or for more than an aggregate of three Business Days in any 30-day Trading Day period or the delisting of the Common Stock from the Principal Market; (iii) the Company's (A) failure to cure a Conversion Failure by delivery of the required number of shares of Common Stock or a new Note (in accordance with section 18(d)), as applicable, within 10 days after the receipt by the Company of a Conversion Notice or (B) notice, written or oral, to any holder of the Notes, including by way of public announcement or through any of its agents, at any time, of its intention not to comply with a request for conversion of any Notes into shares of Common Stock that is tendered in accordance with the provisions of the Notes; (iv) the Company's failure to pay to the Holder any amount of Principal, Interest, Late Charges or other amounts when and as due under this Note, the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement or any other agreement, document, certificate or other instrument delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby to which the Holder is a party; (v) any default under, redemption of or acceleration prior to maturity of any Indebtedness (as defined in Section 3(r) of the Securities Purchase Agreement) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 3(a) of the Securities Purchase Agreement) other than NRG (as defined below) (including, without limitation, the Other Notes) of at least $50,000,000; (vi) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than NRG (as defined below), pursuant to or within the meaning of Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar Federal or state law for the relief of debtors (collectively, "BANKRUPTCY LAW"), (A) commences a voluntary case, (B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case, (C) consents to the appointment of a receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator or similar official (a "CUSTODIAN"), (D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors or (E) admits in writing that it is generally unable to pay its debts as they become due; (vii) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that (A) is for relief against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than NRG (as defined below) in an involuntary case, (B) appoints a Custodian of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than NRG (as defined below) or (C) orders the liquidation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than NRG (as defined below); or (viii) the Company breaches any representation, warranty, covenant (other than any covenant to deliver the NRG Opinion) or other term or condition of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement, this Note or any other 7
agreement, document, certificate or other instrument delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby and hereby to which the Holder is a party, except, in the case of a breach of a covenant which is curable, only if such breach continues for a period of at least 10 consecutive days. (b) Redemption Right. Promptly after the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to this Note or the Other Notes, the Company shall deliver written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier (a "EVENT OF DEFAULT NOTICE") to the Holder. At any time after the earlier of the Holder's receipt of an Event of Default Notice and the Holder becoming aware of an Event of Default, the Holder may require the Company to redeem all or any portion of this Note by delivering written notice thereof (the "EVENT OF DEFAULT REDEMPTION NOTICE") to the Company, which Event of Default Redemption Notice shall indicate the portion of this Note the Holder is electing to redeem. Each portion of this Note subject to redemption by the Company pursuant to this Section 4(b) shall be redeemed by the Company at a price equal to the greater of (i) the product of (x) the Conversion Amount and (y) the quotient determined by dividing (A) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock immediately prior to such Event of Default by (B) the Conversion Price and (ii) the product of (x) the Conversion Amount and (y) the Redemption Premium (the "EVENT OF DEFAULT REDEMPTION PRICE"). Redemptions required by this Section 4(b) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 10. (5) RIGHTS UPON CHANGE OF CONTROL. (a) Change of Control. Each of the following events shall constitute a "CHANGE OF CONTROL": (i) the consolidation, merger or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization or recapitalization) of the Company with or into another Person in which holders of the Company's voting power immediately prior to the transaction cease after the transaction to hold, directly or indirectly, a majority of the voting power of the surviving entity or entities or the voting power necessary to elect a majority of the members of the board of directors (or their equivalent if other than a corporation) of such entity or entities; (ii) the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Company's assets; or (iii) a purchase, tender or exchange offer made to and accepted by the holders of more than the 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. (b) Assumption. Prior to the consummation of any Change of Control, the Company will secure from any Person purchasing the Company's assets or Common Stock or any successor resulting from such Change of Control (in each case, an "ACQUIRING ENTITY") a written agreement (in form and substance satisfactory to the holders of Notes representing a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding) to deliver to each holder of Notes in exchange for such Notes, a security of the Acquiring Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to the Notes, including, without limitation, having a principal amount and interest rate equal to the principal amounts and the 8
interest rates of the Notes held by such holder, and satisfactory to the holders of Notes representing a majority of the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. In the event that an Acquiring Entity is directly or indirectly controlled by a company or entity whose common stock or similar equity interest is listed, designated or quoted on a securities exchange or trading market, the holders of notes representing a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may elect to treat such Person as the Acquiring Entity for purposes of this Section 5(b). (c) Redemption Right. No sooner than 15 days nor later than 10 days prior to the consummation of a Change of Control, but not prior to the public announcement of such Change of Control, the Company shall deliver written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier to the Holder (a "CHANGE OF CONTROL NOTICE"). At any time on or after consummation of such Change of Control, the Holder may require the Company to redeem all or any portion of this Note by delivering written notice thereof ("CHANGE OF CONTROL REDEMPTION NOTICE" and, collectively with an Event of Default Redemption Notice, "REDEMPTION NOTICES" and, individually, each a "REDEMPTION NOTICE") to the Company, which Change of Control Redemption Notice shall indicate the Conversion Amount the Holder is electing to redeem. The portion of this Note subject to redemption pursuant to this Section 5(c) shall be redeemed by the Company at a price equal to the greater of (i) the product of (x) the Conversion Amount and (y) the quotient determined by dividing (A) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock immediately following the public announcement of such proposed Change of Control by (B) the Conversion Price and (ii) 115% of the Conversion Amount (the "CHANGE OF CONTROL REDEMPTION PRICE" and, together with the Event of Default Redemption Price, the "REDEMPTION PRICE"). Redemptions required by this Section 5(c) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 and shall have priority to payments to other shareholders in connection with a Change of Control. (6) RIGHTS UPON ISSUANCE OF PURCHASE RIGHTS AND OTHER CORPORATE EVENTS. (a) Purchase Rights. If at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of Common Stock (the "PURCHASE RIGHTS"), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of this Note) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights. (b) Other Corporate Events. Prior to the consummation of any recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation, merger or other business combination (other than a Change of Control) pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock (a "CORPORATE 9
EVENT"), the Company shall make appropriate provision to insure that the Holder will thereafter have the right to receive upon a conversion of this Note, (i) in addition to the shares of Common Stock receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets to which the Holder would have been entitled with respect to such shares of Common Stock had such shares of Common Stock been held by the Holder upon the consummation of such Corporate Event or (ii) in lieu of the shares of Common Stock otherwise receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets received by the holders of Common Stock in connection with the consummation of such Corporate Event in such amounts as the Holder would have been entitled to receive had this Note initially been issued with conversion rights for the form of such consideration (as opposed to shares of Common Stock) at a conversion rate for such consideration commensurate with the Conversion Rate. Provision made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be in a form and substance satisfactory to the holders of Notes representing a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. (7) RIGHTS UPON ISSUANCE OF OTHER SECURITIES. (a) Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Issuance of Common Stock. If and whenever on or after the issuance of the Third Notes, the Company issues or sells, or in accordance with this Section 7(a) is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of Common Stock (including the issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock owned or held by or for the account of the Company, but excluding shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold by the Company (I) in connection with the Xcel Energy Direct Purchase Plan or any employee benefit plan which has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, pursuant to which the Company's securities may be issued to any employee, officer or director for services provided to the Company or its Subsidiaries (each, an "APPROVED STOCK PLAN") or (II) upon conversion of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes) for a consideration per share less than the higher of the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the date of such issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale and the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale (such higher price is referred to herein as the "APPLICABLE PRICE"), then immediately after such issue or sale (subject to Section 7(a)(vi)), the Conversion Price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to the product of (x) the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale or deemed issuance or sale and (y) the quotient determined by dividing (1) the sum of the product of the Applicable Price and the number of shares of Common Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale or deemed issue or sale and the consideration, if any, received by the Company upon such issue or sale, by (2) the product of the Applicable Price multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately after such issue or sale or deemed issue or sale. For purposes of determining the adjusted Conversion Price under this Section 7(a), the following shall be applicable: (i) Issuance of Options. If the Company in any manner grants or sells any Options and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of such Option is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the granting or sale of such Option for such price 10
per share. For purposes of this Section 7(a)(i), the "lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of such Option" shall be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon granting or sale of the Option, upon exercise of the Option and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon exercise of such Option. No further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock or of such Convertible Securities upon the exercise of such Options or upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities. If the Company issues or sells any Options which are Variable Securities, no adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made pursuant to this Section 7(a), and no shares of Common Stock shall be deemed outstanding with respect to such Variable Securities, as a result of the issuance of such Variable Securities until the actual issuance of Common Stock or Convertible Securities upon exercise of such Variable Securities, except to the extent such Variable Security also includes as a component of the exercise price a price which does not vary with the market price of the Common Stock. (ii) Issuance of Convertible Securities. If the Company in any manner issues or sells any Convertible Securities and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion, exercise or exchange thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the issuance of sale of such Convertible Securities for such price per share. For the purposes of this Section 7(a)(ii), the "price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion, exercise or exchange" shall be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the issuance or sale of the Convertible Security and upon the conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Security. No further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities, and if any such issue or sale of such Convertible Securities is made upon exercise of any Options for which adjustment of the Conversion Price had been or are to be made pursuant to other provisions of this Section 7(a), no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made by reason of such issue or sale. If the Company issues or sells any Convertible Securities which are Variable Securities, no adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made pursuant to this Section 7(a), and no shares of Common Stock shall be deemed outstanding with respect to such Variable Security, as a result of the issuance of such Variable Securities until the actual issuance of Common Stock upon exercise of such Variable Securities, except to the extent such Variable Security also includes as a component of the conversion, exercise or exchange price a price which does not vary with the market price of the Common Stock. (iii) Change in Option Price or Rate of Conversion. If the purchase price provided for in any Options, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issue, conversion or 11
exchange of any Convertible Securities, or the rate at which any Convertible Securities are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock changes at any time, the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such change shall be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been in effect at such time had such Options or Convertible Securities provided for such changed purchase price, additional consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold. For purposes of this Section 7(a)(iii), if the terms of any Option or Convertible Security that was outstanding as of the Issuance Date are changed in the manner described in the immediately preceding sentence, then such Option or Convertible Security and the Common Stock deemed issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such change. No adjustment shall be made if such adjustment would result in an increase of the Conversion Price then in effect. (iv) Calculation of Consideration Received. In case any Option is issued in connection with the issue or sale of other securities of the Company, together comprising one integrated transaction in which no specific consideration is allocated to such Options by the parties thereto, the Options will be deemed to have been issued for a consideration of $.01. If any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor will be deemed to be the net amount received by the Company therefor. If any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the Company will be the fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of securities, in which case the amount of consideration received by the Company will be the Closing Sale Price of such securities on the date of receipt. If any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the Company is the surviving entity, the amount of consideration therefor will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to such Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, as the case may be. The fair value of any consideration other than cash or securities will be determined jointly by the Company and the holders of Notes representing a majority of the principal amounts of the Notes then outstanding. If such parties are unable to reach agreement within ten days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the "VALUATION EVENT"), the fair value of such consideration will be determined within five Business Days after the tenth day following the Valuation Event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly selected by the Company and the holders of Notes representing a majority of the principal amounts of the Notes then outstanding. The determination of such appraiser shall be deemed binding upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the Company. (v) Record Date. If the Company takes a record of the holders of Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (A) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in Common Stock, Options or in Convertible Securities or (B) to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date will be deemed 12
to be the date of the issue or sale of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. (vi) Common Stock Deemed Outstanding. "COMMON STOCK DEEMED OUTSTANDING" means, at any given time, the number of shares of Common Stock actually outstanding at such time, plus the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be outstanding pursuant to Sections 7(a)(i) and 7(a)(ii) hereof regardless of whether the Options or Convertible Securities are actually exercisable at such time, but excluding any shares of Common Stock owned or held by or for the account of the Company or issuable upon conversion of the Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes. (vii) Delayed Adjustment. In addition to the foregoing provisions of this Section 7(a), the Weighted Average Price, Closing Sales Price and Closing Bid Price shall be subject to adjustment, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, for any days during any measuring period, including, without limitation, the Tranche A Pricing Period, used herein that occur prior to any of the aforementioned events if such events occur prior to the end of such measuring period. (b) Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock. If the Company at any time subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. If the Company at any time combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased. (c) Other Events. If any event occurs of the type contemplated by the provisions of this Section 7 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then the Company's Board of Directors will make an appropriate adjustment in the Conversion Price so as to protect the rights of the Holder under this Note; provided that no such adjustment will increase the Conversion Price as otherwise determined pursuant to this Section 7. (8) NONCIRCUMVENTION. The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Articles of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of, or enter into any agreement which by its terms restricts or otherwise impairs the Company's performance of the terms of, this Note or any of the other Transaction Documents (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement), and will at all times in good faith carry out all of the provisions of this Note and take all action as may be required to protect the rights of the Holder of this Note. 13
(9) RESERVATION OF AUTHORIZED SHARES. (a) Reservation. The Company shall initially reserve out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock a number of shares of Common Stock for each of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes equal to 115% of the Conversion Rate with respect to the Conversion Amount of each such Note and Separate Tranche Note. Thereafter, the Company shall, so long as any of the Notes or Separate Tranche Notes are outstanding, take all action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Notes and Separate Tranche Note, at least 100% of the number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion of all of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes then outstanding; provided that at no time shall the number of shares of Common Stock so reserved be less than the number of shares required to be reserved by the previous sentence (without regard to any limitations on conversions) (the "REQUIRED RESERVE AMOUNT"). The initial number of shares of Common Stock reserved for conversions of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Note and each increase in the number of shares so reserved shall be allocated pro rata among the holders of the Notes and Separate Tranche Note based on the principal amount of the Notes and Separate Tranche Notes held by each holder at the time of Issuance Date or increase in the number of reserved shares, as the case may be (the "AUTHORIZED SHARE ALLOCATION"). In the event that a holder shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such holder's Notes, each transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such holder's Authorized Share Allocation. Any shares of Common Stock reserved and allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Notes shall be allocated to the remaining holders of Notes, pro rata based on the principal amount of the Notes then held by such holders. (b) Insufficient Authorized Shares. If at any time while any of the Notes or Separate Tranche Note remain outstanding the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved shares of Common Stock to satisfy its obligation to reserve for issuance upon conversion of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes at least a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Required Reserve Amount (an "AUTHORIZED SHARE FAILURE"), then the Company shall immediately take all action necessary to increase the Company's authorized shares of Common Stock to an amount sufficient to allow the Company to reserve the Required Reserve Amount for the Notes and Separate Tranche Note then outstanding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the date of the occurrence of an Authorized Share Failure, but in no event later than 60 days after the occurrence of such Authorized Share Failure, the Company shall hold a meeting of its shareholders for the approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock. In connection with such meeting, the Company shall provide each shareholder with a proxy statement and shall use its best efforts to solicit its shareholders' approval of such increase in authorized shares of Common Stock and to cause its board of directors to recommend to the shareholders that they approve such proposal. (10) REDEMPTION. (a) Mechanics. In the event that the Holder has sent a Redemption Notice to the Company pursuant to Section 4(b) or Section 5(c), the Holder shall promptly 14
submit this Note to the Company. The Company shall deliver the applicable Event of Default Redemption Price to the Holder within five Business Days after the Company's receipt of the Holder's Event of Default Redemption Notice and thereafter the Holder shall promptly deliver this Note to the Company. If the Holder has submitted a Change of Control Redemption Notice in accordance with Section 5(c), the Company shall deliver the applicable Change of Control Redemption Price to the Holder concurrently with the consummation of such Change of Control if such notice is received prior to the consummation of such Change of Control and within five Business Days after the Company's receipt of such notice otherwise. In the event of a redemption of less than all of the Conversion Amount of this Note, the Company shall promptly cause to be issued and delivered to the Holder a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) representing the outstanding Principal which has not been redeemed. In the event that the Company does not pay the Redemption Price to the Holder within the time period required above in this Section 10(a) at any time thereafter and until the Company pays such unpaid Redemption Price in full, the Holder shall have the option to, in lieu of redemption, require the Company to promptly return to the Holder all or any portion of this Note representing the Conversion Amount that was submitted for redemption and for which the applicable Redemption Price (together with any Late Charges thereon) has not been paid. Upon the Company's receipt of such notice, (x) the Redemption Notice shall be null and void with respect to such Conversion Amount, (y) the Company shall immediately return this Note, or issue a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) to the Holder representing such Conversion Amount and (z) the Conversion Price of this Note or such new Notes shall be adjusted to the lesser of (A) the Conversion Price as in effect on the date on which the Redemption Notice is voided and (B) the lowest Closing Bid Price during the period beginning on and including the date on which the Redemption Notice is delivered to the Company and ending on and including the date on which the Redemption Notice is voided. The Holder's delivery of a notice voiding a Redemption Notice and exercise of its rights following such notice shall not affect the Company's obligations to make any payments of Late Charges which have accrued prior to the date of such notice with respect to the Conversion Amount subject to such notice. (b) Redemption by Other Holders. Upon the Company's receipt of notice from any of the holders of the Other Notes or the Separate Tranche Notes for redemption or repayment as a result of an event or occurrence substantially similar to the events or occurrences described in Section 4(b) or Section 5(c) (each an "OTHER REDEMPTION NOTICE"), the Company shall immediately forward to the Holder by facsimile a copy of such notice. If the Company receives a Redemption Notice and one or more Other Redemption Notices during the seven Business Day period beginning on and including the date which is three Business Days prior to the Company's receipt of the Holder's Redemption Notice and ending on and including the date which is three Business Days after the Company's receipt of the Holder's Redemption Notice and the Company is unable to redeem all principal, interest and other amounts designated in such Redemption Notice and such Other Redemption Notices received during such seven Business Day period, then the Company shall redeem a pro rata amount from each holder of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes (including the Holder) based on the principal amount of the Notes and the Separate Tranche Notes submitted for redemption pursuant to such Redemption Notice and such Other Redemption Notices received by the Company during such seven Business Day period. 15
(11) RESTRICTION ON REDEMPTION. Until all of the Notes have been converted, redeemed or otherwise satisfied in accordance with their terms, the Company shall not, directly or indirectly, redeem its capital stock without the prior express written consent of the holders of Notes representing at least two-thirds of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. (12) SUBORDINATION; ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS. Payments of Principal and Interest and other payments due under this Note shall rank pari passu in right of payment with all (and shall not be subordinated to any) unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company and will be senior in right of payment to all subordinated indebtedness of the Company. (13) COVENANTS. (a) Indebtedness. The Company shall not create, incur, assume, guarantee or suffer to exist, or otherwise become or remain liable with respect to, any Indebtedness other than Permitted Indebtedness and Subordinated Indebtedness. "Subordinated Indebtedness" shall mean Indebtedness that is unsecured and subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and other obligations owing to the Holders in accordance with a subordination agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Holders. "Permitted Indebtedness" shall mean any Indebtedness that is unsecured and is not senior in right of payment to the Notes and is otherwise on terms that are no more favorable to the holders thereof than the terms of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes unless such more favorable terms are offered to the Holders. (b) Liens. The Company shall not create, incur, assume or suffer to exist, or permit any of its Subsidiaries (other than NRG Energy Inc. or its subsidiaries (collectively, "NRG")) to create, incur, assume or suffer to exist, any Lien upon or with respect to any of its properties, whether now owned or hereafter acquired; sign or suffer to exist any security agreement authorizing any secured party thereunder to file a Uniform Commercial Code financing statement (or the equivalent thereof) as notice of a Lien on any property of the Company or its Subsidiaries; sell any of its property or assets subject to an understanding or agreement, contingent or otherwise, to repurchase such property or assets (including sales of accounts receivable) with recourse to it or any of its Subsidiaries or assign or otherwise transfer, or permit any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Existing Utility Subsidiaries (as defined in the Bank Facility)) to assign or otherwise transfer, any account or other right to receive income; other than, as to all of the above, Permitted Liens.

(c) Transactions With Affiliates. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, effect any transaction with any Affiliate (as defined in the Bank Facility) that is (a) outside the ordinary course of business or (b) on a basis less favorable than would at the time be obtainable for a comparable transaction in arms-length dealing with an unrelated third party, provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, no loan, payment or other form of contribution shall be made to NRG unless it is in an amount not in excess of (i) $300 Million payable pursuant to the Support Agreement and Capital Subscription Agreement, dated as of May 29, 2002, by and between the Company and NRG Energy Inc. and (ii) $250 Million in respect of guarantee obligations relating to the power marketing business of NRG; provided further that with respect to any payment permitted pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Company shall, in the context of a restructuring of NRG, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain a full release of all obligations and liabilities of the Company relating to NRG.

(f) Scope of Business.

(15) PARTICIPATION.

Payments under the preceding sentence shall be made concurrently with the dividend or distribution to the holders of Common Stock. (16) VOTE TO ISSUE, OR CHANGE THE TERMS OF, NOTES. The affirmative vote at a meeting duly called for such purpose or the written consent without a 17

If this Note is to be transferred, the Holder shall surrender this Note to the Company, whereupon the Company will forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of the Holder a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)), registered as the Holder may request, representing the outstanding Principal being transferred by the Holder and, if less then the entire outstanding Principal is being transferred, a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) to the Holder representing the outstanding Principal not being transferred. The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this Note, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of Section 3(c)(iii) and this Section 18(a), following conversion or redemption of any portion of this Note, the outstanding Principal represented by this Note may be less than the Principal stated on the face of this Note. (b) Lost, Stolen or Mutilated Note.

The remedies provided in this Note shall be cumulative and in addition to all other remedies available under this Note, the Securities Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement, at law or in equity (including a decree of specific performance and/or other injunctive relief), and nothing herein shall limit the Holder's right to pursue actual and consequential damages for any failure by the Company to comply with the terms of this Note. Amounts set forth or provided for herein with respect to payments, conversion and the like (and the computation thereof) shall be the amounts to be received by the Holder and shall not, except as expressly provided herein, be subject to any other obligation of the Company (or the performance thereof). The Company acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to the Holder and that the remedy at law for any such breach may be inadequate. The Company therefore agrees that, in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, the Holder shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies, to an injunction restraining any breach, without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required. (20) PAYMENT OF COLLECTION, ENFORCEMENT AND OTHER COSTS.

No failure or delay on the part of the Holder in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privilege.

Bid Price or the Closing Sale Price or any other calculation hereunder to an independent, reputable investment bank selected by the Company and approved by the Holder or (b) the disputed arithmetic calculation of the Conversion Rate or the Redemption Price to the Company's independent, outside accountant. The Company, at the Company's expense, shall cause the investment bank or the accountant, as the case may be, to perform the determinations or calculations and notify the Company and the Holder of the results no later than five Business Days from the time it receives the disputed determinations or calculations.

Any amount of Interest, Principal or other amount due under the Transaction Documents (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement) which is not paid when due shall result in a late charge being incurred and payable by the Company in an amount equal to interest on such amount at the rate of 12% per annum from the date such amount was due until the same is paid in full ("LATE CHARGE"). 20
(25) CANCELLATION. After all Principal, accrued Interest and other amounts at any time owed on this Note has been paid in full, this Note shall automatically be deemed canceled, shall be surrendered to the Company for cancellation and shall not be reissued.

At any time while this Agreement is in effect, in the event that Form S-3 is not available for the registration of the resale of Registrable Securities hereunder, the Company shall (i) register the resale of the Registrable Securities on another appropriate form, reasonably acceptable to the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities, and (ii) undertake to register the Registrable Securities on Form S-3 as soon as such form is available, provided that the Company shall maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement then in effect until such time as a Registration Statement on Form S-3 covering the Registrable Securities has been declared effective by the SEC. (e) Sufficient Number of Shares Registered. In the event that the number of shares available under (i) a Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2(a) together with (ii) any Registration Statements filed pursuant to this Section 2(e) is insufficient to cover the 6
resale of 100% of the Registrable Securities required to be covered by such Registration Statement or an Investor's allocated portion of the registered shares pursuant to Section 2(b), the Company shall, subject to Section 3(t), amend any such Registration Statement, or file a new Registration Statement (on the short form available therefor, if applicable), or both, so as to cover at least 100% of the Registrable Securities calculated as of the trading day immediately preceding the date of the filing of such amendment or new Registration Statement, in each case, as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than 15 days after the necessity therefor arises. The Company shall use its best efforts to cause such amendment and/or new Registration Statement to become effective as soon as practicable following the filing thereof. 3. RELATED OBLIGATIONS. In connection with the Company's obligation to file a Registration Statement with the SEC pursuant to Section 2(a) or 2(e), the Company shall have the following obligations: (a) The Company shall submit to the SEC, within two (2) Business Days after the Company learns that no review of a particular Registration Statement will be made by the staff of the SEC or that the staff has no further comments on a Registration Statement, as the case may be, a request for acceleration of effectiveness of such Registration Statement to a time and date not later than 48 hours after the submission of such request. The Company shall keep a particular Registration Statement effective pursuant to Rule 415 at all times until the earlier of (i) the date as of which all the Investors are eligible to sell all of the Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the 1933 Act (or any successor thereto) or (ii) the date the Investors have sold all the Covered Securities and Registrable Securities pursuant to an effective Registration Statement (the "REGISTRATION PERIOD"). The Company shall ensure that each Registration Statement (including any amendments or supplements thereto and prospectuses contained therein) shall not, when it becomes effective, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. (b) Subject to Section 3(t), the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and supplements to a Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection with such Registration Statement, which prospectus is to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 promulgated under the 1933 Act, as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective at all times during the Registration Period, and, during such period, comply with the provisions of the 1933 Act with respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities of the Company covered by such Registration Statement until such time as all of such Registrable Securities shall have been disposed of in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the seller or sellers thereof as set forth in such Registration Statement. In the case of amendments and supplements to a Registration Statement which are required to be filed pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant to this Section 3(b)) by reason of the Company filing a report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q or Form 8-K or any analogous report under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 ACT"), the Company shall have incorporated such report by reference into the Registration Statement, if applicable, or shall file such amendments or supplements with the SEC on the same day on which the 1934 Act report is filed which created the requirement for the Company to amend or supplement the Registration Statement. Without limiting the generality of the obligation set forth in this Section 3(b), the Company shall, from time to time as may be required by applicable laws, file a supplement to the prospectus included in a Registration Statement which updates the 7
information contained in the Registration Statement relating to (i) the aggregate principal amount of Registrable Securities outstanding, (ii) the conversion price of the Registrable Securities, (iii) the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding Registrable Securities, (iv) the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by each Investor whose shares are included in the Registration Statement, and (v) the number of shares of Common Stock being offered by each Investor whose shares are included in the Registration Statement. The Company shall file any such supplement with the SEC under Rule 424(b)(3) of the 1933 Act, or if the supplement may not be filed under Rule 424(b)(3) of the 1933 Act, then under such other applicable provisions of the 1933 Act.

The Company shall furnish to Legal Counsel, without charge, (i) any correspondence from the SEC or the staff of the SEC to the Company or its representatives relating to any Registration Statement, (ii) promptly after the same is prepared and filed with the SEC, one copy of any Registration Statement and any amendment(s) thereto, including financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated therein by reference and all exhibits and (iii) upon the effectiveness of any Registration Statement, one copy of the prospectus included in such Registration Statement and all amendments and supplements thereto.

(e) The Company shall use its best efforts to (i) register and qualify, unless an exemption from registration or qualification applies, all the Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement under all securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions in the United States, (ii) prepare and file in those jurisdictions, such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and supplements to such registrations and qualifications as may be necessary to maintain the effectiveness thereof during the Registration Period, (iii) take such other actions as may be necessary to maintain such registrations and qualifications in effect at all times during the Registration Period, and (iv) take all other actions reasonably necessary or advisable to qualify the Registrable Securities for sale in such jurisdictions; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to (x) qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this Section 3(e), (y) subject itself to general taxation in any such jurisdiction, or (z) file a general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction. The Company shall promptly notify Legal Counsel and each Investor who holds Registrable Securities of the receipt by the 8
Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the registration or qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale under the securities or "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction in the United States or its receipt of actual notice of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. (f) The Company shall (i) notify Legal Counsel and each Investor in writing (provided that in no event shall such notice include any material, nonpublic information) as promptly as practicable upon its discovery that the prospectus included in a Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, (ii) promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to such Registration Statement to correct such untrue statement or omission, and (iii) deliver ten copies of such supplement or amendment to Legal Counsel and each Investor (or such other number of copies as Legal Counsel or such Investor may reasonably request). The Company shall also promptly notify Legal Counsel and each Investor in writing (provided that in no event shall such notice include any material, nonpublic information) (x) when a prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and when a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment has become effective (notification of such effectiveness shall be delivered to Legal Counsel and each Investor by facsimile on the same day of such effectiveness and by overnight mail), (y) of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to a Registration Statement or related prospectus or related information, and (z) of the Company's reasonable determination that a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement would be appropriate. (g) The Company shall use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or other suspension of effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or the suspension of the qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction and, if such an order or suspension is issued, to obtain the withdrawal of such order or suspension at the earliest possible moment and to notify (provided that in no event shall such notification include any material, nonpublic information) Legal Counsel and each Investor who holds Registrable Securities being sold of the issuance of such order and the resolution thereof or its receipt of actual notice of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for such purpose. (h) At the request of any Investor to satisfy its obligations, if any, in connection with offerings under the 1933 Act, the Company shall furnish to such Investor, on the date of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and thereafter from time to time on such dates as an Investor may reasonably request (i) a letter, dated such date, from the Company's independent certified public accountants in form and substance as is customarily given by independent certified public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the Investors, and (ii) an opinion, dated as of such date, of counsel representing the Company for purposes of such Registration Statement, in form, scope and substance as is customarily given in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the Investors.

directors and employees to supply all information which any Inspector may reasonably request that is customarily supplied in connection with such a transaction; provided, however, that each Inspector shall hold in strict confidence and shall not make any disclosure (except to an Investor) or use of any Record or other information which the Company determines in good faith to be confidential, and of which determination the Inspectors are so notified, unless (a) the disclosure of such Records is necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in any Registration Statement or is otherwise required under the 1933 Act, (b) the release of such Records is ordered pursuant to a final, non-appealable subpoena or order from a court or government body of competent jurisdiction, or (c) the information in such Records has been made generally available to the public other than by disclosure in violation of this or any other agreement of which the Inspector has knowledge. Each Investor agrees that it shall, upon learning that disclosure of such Records is sought in or by a court or governmental body of competent jurisdiction or through other means, give prompt notice to the Company and allow the Company, at its expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of, or to obtain a protective order for, the Records deemed confidential. (j) The Company shall hold in confidence and not make any disclosure of information concerning an Investor provided to the Company unless (i) disclosure of such information is necessary to comply with federal or state securities laws, (ii) the disclosure of such information is necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in any Registration Statement, (iii) the release of such information is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other final, non-appealable order from a court or governmental body of competent jurisdiction, (iv) such information has been made generally available to the public other than by disclosure in violation of this Agreement or any other agreement or (v) such information has been made available to the Company by a third party in good faith and not under or in breach of a requirement of confidentiality. The Company agrees that it shall, upon learning that disclosure of such information concerning an Investor is sought in or by a court or governmental body of competent jurisdiction or through other means, give prompt written notice to such Investor and allow such Investor, at the Investor's expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of, or to obtain a protective order for, such information. (k) The Company shall use its best efforts either to (i) cause all the Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement to be listed on each securities exchange on which securities of the same class or series issued by the Company are then listed, if any, if the listing of such Registrable Securities is then permitted under the rules of such exchange, or (ii) secure designation and quotation of all the Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement on the Nasdaq National Market System or, if, despite the Company's best efforts to satisfy the preceding clause (i) or (ii), the Company is unsuccessful in satisfying the preceding clause (i) or (ii), to secure the inclusion for quotation on The Nasdaq SmallCap Market for such Registrable Securities and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to arrange for at least two market makers to register with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD") as such with respect to such Registrable Securities. The Company shall pay all fees and expenses in connection with satisfying its obligation under this Section 3(k). (l) The Company shall cooperate with the Investors who hold Registrable Securities being offered to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates (not bearing any restrictive legend) representing the Registrable Securities to be offered pursuant to a Registration Statement and enable such certificates to be in such denominations or amounts, as the case may be, as the Investors may reasonably request and registered in such names as the Investors may request. 10
(m) The Company shall provide a transfer agent and registrar of all such Registrable Securities not later than the effective date of the applicable Registration Statement. (n) If requested by an Investor, the Company as promptly as practicable shall: (i) incorporate in a prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment to the extent required by the 1933 Act such information as an Investor requests to be included therein relating to the sale and distribution of Registrable Securities, including, without limitation, information with respect to the number of Registrable Securities being offered or sold, the purchase price being paid therefor, the persons selling the Registrable Securities and any other terms of the offering of the Registrable Securities; (ii) make all required filings of such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment promptly after being notified of the matters to be incorporated in such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment; and (iii) supplement or make amendments to any Registration Statement if reasonably requested by a holder of such Registrable Securities. (o) The Company shall use its best efforts to cause the Registrable Securities covered by the applicable Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities in the United States as may be necessary to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities. (p) The Company shall make generally available to its security holders as soon as practical, but not later than 90 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement (in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 under the 1933 Act) covering a twelve-month period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the effective date of the Registration Statement. (q) The Company shall otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC in connection with any registration hereunder. (r) Within two (2) Business Days after any Registration Statement which includes the applicable Registrable Securities is ordered effective by the SEC, the Company shall deliver, and shall cause legal counsel for the Company to deliver, to the transfer agent for such Registrable Securities (with copies to the Investors whose Registrable Securities are included in such Registration Statement) confirmation that such Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A. (s) The Company shall take all other reasonable actions necessary to expedite and facilitate disposition by the Investors of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement. (t) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall have the right to defer filing any Registration Statement or, at any time after a Registration Statement has been filed with the SEC, the Company may suspend sales under any such filed Registration Statement or delay the disclosure of material, nonpublic information concerning the Company, if in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with its outside counsel to be certain that any such disclosure is not required, it is in the best interest of the Company to do so (a "GRACE PERIOD"); provided, that the Company shall promptly (i) notify each Investor in writing of the existence of material, nonpublic information 11
giving rise to a Grace Period (provided that in no event shall such notice include any material, nonpublic information) and the date on which the Grace Period will begin, and (ii) notify each Investor in writing of the date on which the Grace Period ends; and, provided further, that no Grace Period shall exceed 10 consecutive days and during any 365 day period such Grace Periods shall not exceed an aggregate of 30 days (an "ALLOWABLE GRACE PERIOD"). For purposes of determining the length of a Grace Period above, the Grace Period shall begin on and include the date that each Investor receives the notice referred to in clause (i) above and shall end on the date for which the Company provides the notice referred to in clause (ii) above (not to exceed 10 days). The provisions of Sections 2(a), 2(e), 3(a), 3(b), 3(g) and the first sentence of Section 3(f) hereof shall not be applicable during the period of any Allowable Grace Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to deliver unlegended shares of Common Stock to a transferee of an Investor in accordance with the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement in connection with any sale of Registrable Securities with respect to which an Investor has entered into a contract for sale prior to the Investor's receipt of the notice of a Grace Period and for which the Investor has not yet settled. 4. OBLIGATIONS OF THE INVESTORS. (a) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the first anticipated filing date of a Registration Statement or an amendment thereto, the Company shall notify each Investor in writing of the information the Company requires from each such Investor if such Investor elects to have any of such Investor's Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement or, with respect to an amendment or supplement, if such Investor's Registrable Securities are included in such Registration Statement. It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the Company to complete the registration pursuant to this Agreement with respect to the Registrable Securities of a particular Investor that such Investor shall furnish to the Company such information regarding itself, the Registrable Securities held by it and the intended method of disposition of the Registrable Securities held by it as shall be reasonably required to effect the registration of such Registrable Securities and shall execute such documents in connection with such registration as the Company may reasonably request. If an Investor fails to provide the Company with the information so requested which the Company reasonably requires within five (5) Business Days after the Investor's receipt of such request, then the applicable Mandatory Filing Date, Mandatory Effective Date and the 15-day period referred to in Section 2(e) shall be extended solely with respect to such Investor by one day for each day after such fifth (5th) Business Day that the Investor fails to provide such information; provided, however, that the failure of an Investor to timely provide such information pursuant to the Company's request shall not otherwise affect the Company's obligations under this Agreement to the other Investors; provided, further, however, that any Investor which fails to provide the Company with such information within the applicable time period set forth above in response to a request prior to the filing of a Registration Statement or amendment or supplement thereto shall bear the costs actually incurred by the Company of any additional Registration Statement or amendment(s) or supplement(s) thereto which the Company is required to file due solely to such failure. (b) Each Investor, by such Investor's acceptance of the Registrable Securities, agrees to cooperate with the Company as reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of any Registration Statement hereunder, unless such Investor has notified the Company in writing of such Investor's election to exclude all of such Investor's Registrable Securities from such Registration Statement. 12
(c) Each Investor agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(g) or the first sentence of 3(f) or notice from the Company of a Grace Period, such Investor will immediately discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement(s) covering such Registrable Securities until such Investor's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 3(g) or the first sentence of 3(f) or receipt of notice that no supplement or amendment is required or that the Grace Period has ended. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to deliver unlegended shares of Common Stock to a transferee of an Investor in accordance with the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement in connection with any sale of Registrable Securities with respect to which an Investor has entered into a contract for sale prior to the Investor's receipt of a notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(g) or the first sentence of 3(f) or notice from the Company of a Grace Period and for which the Investor has not yet settled. 5. EXPENSES OF REGISTRATION. All reasonable expenses, other than underwriting discounts and brokerage commissions, incurred in connection with registrations, filings or qualifications pursuant to Sections 2 and 3, including, without limitation, all registration, listing and qualifications fees, printers and accounting fees, and fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company shall be paid by the Company. 6. INDEMNIFICATION. In the event any Registrable Securities are included in a Registration Statement under this Agreement: (a) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company will, and hereby does, indemnify, hold harmless and defend each Investor, the directors, officers, partners, employees, agents, representatives of, and each Person, if any, who controls any Investor within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PERSON"), against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, fines, penalties, charges, costs, reasonable attorneys' fees, amounts paid in settlement or expenses, joint or several, (collectively, "CLAIMS") incurred in investigating, preparing or defending any action, claim, suit, inquiry, proceeding, investigation or appeal taken from the foregoing by or before any court or governmental, administrative or other regulatory agency, body or the SEC, whether pending or threatened, whether or not an indemnified party is or may be a party thereto ("INDEMNIFIED DAMAGES"), to which any of them may become subject insofar as such Claims (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact in a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto or in any filing made in connection with the qualification of the offering under the securities or other "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction in which Registrable Securities are offered ("BLUE SKY FILING"), or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus if used prior to the effective date of such Registration Statement, or contained in the final prospectus (as amended or supplemented, if the Company files any amendment thereof or supplement thereto with the SEC) or the omission or alleged omission to state therein any 13
material fact necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which the statements therein were made, not misleading, (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, any other law, including, without limitation, any state securities law, or any rule or regulation thereunder relating to the offer or sale of the Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement or (iv) any material violation of this Agreement (the matters in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) being, collectively, "VIOLATIONS"). Subject to Section 6(d), the Company shall reimburse the Indemnified Persons, promptly as such expenses are incurred and are due and payable, for any legal fees or other reasonable expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the indemnification agreement contained in this Section 6(a) and the agreement with respect to contribution contained in Section 7: (i) shall not apply to a Claim by an Indemnified Person arising out of or based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by such Indemnified Person expressly for use in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement or any such amendment thereof or supplement thereto, if such prospectus was timely made available by the Company pursuant to Section 3(d); (ii) shall not be available to the extent such Claim is based on a failure of the Investor to deliver or to cause to be delivered the prospectus made available by the Company, if such prospectus was timely made available by the Company pursuant to Section 3(d); and (iii) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person and shall survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities by the Investors pursuant to Section 9. (b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which an Investor is participating, each such Investor agrees to severally and not jointly indemnify, hold harmless and defend, to the same extent and in the same manner as is set forth in Section 6(a), the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act (each an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") against any Claim or Indemnified Damages to which any of them may become subject, under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise, insofar as such Claim or Indemnified Damages arise out of or are based upon any Violation, in each case to the extent, and only to the extent, that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Investor expressly for use in connection with such Registration Statement; and, subject to Section 6(d), such Investor will reimburse any legal or other reasonable expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6(b) and the agreement with respect to contribution contained in Section 7 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of such Investor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, further, however, that the Investor shall be liable under this Section 6(b) for only that amount of a Claim or Indemnified Damages as does not exceed the net proceeds to such Investor as a result of the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party and shall survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities by the Investors pursuant to Section 9. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the indemnification agreement contained in this Section 6(b) with respect to any prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Indemnified Party if the untrue statement or omission of material fact contained in the prospectus was corrected on a timely basis in the prospectus, as then amended or supplemented. 14
(c) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including any governmental action or proceeding) involving a Claim, such Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party shall, if a Claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 6, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof, and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume control of the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the indemnifying party and the Indemnified Person or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party may retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of that counsel will be at the expense of that Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party, as the case may be, unless (i) the indemnifying party and the Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party, as applicable, shall have mutually agreed to the retention of that counsel, (ii) the indemnifying party does not assume the defense of such proceeding in a timely manner or (iii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party, as applicable, and the indemnified party reasonably objects to such assumption on the ground that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party or another indemnifying party. The Company shall pay reasonable fees for only one separate legal counsel for the Investors, and such legal counsel shall be selected by the Investors holding a majority in interest of the Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement to which the Claim relates. The Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person shall cooperate fully with the indemnifying party in connection with any negotiation or defense of any such action or Claim by the indemnifying party and shall furnish to the indemnifying party all information reasonably available to the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person which relates to such action or Claim. The indemnifying party shall keep the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person fully apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action, claim or proceeding effected without its prior written consent, provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its consent. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or other compromise which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person of a release from all liability in respect to such Claim or litigation. Following indemnification as provided for hereunder, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person with respect to all third parties, firms or corporations relating to the matter for which indemnification has been made. The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party under this Section 6, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced in its ability to defend such action. (d) The indemnification required by this Section 6 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or Indemnified Damages are incurred. 15
(e) The indemnity agreements contained herein shall be in addition to (i) any cause of action or similar right of the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person against the indemnifying party or others, and (ii) any liabilities the indemnifying party may be subject to pursuant to the law. 7. CONTRIBUTION. To the extent any indemnification by an indemnifying party is prohibited or limited by law, the indemnifying party agrees to make the maximum contribution with respect to any amounts for which it would otherwise be liable under Section 6 to the fullest extent permitted by law; provided, however, that: (i) no person involved in the sale of Registrable Securities which person is guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person involved in such sale of Registrable Securities who was not guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation; and (ii) contribution by any seller of Registrable Securities shall be limited in amount to the net amount of proceeds received by such seller from the sale of such Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement. 8. REPORTS UNDER THE 1934 ACT. With a view to making available to the Investors the benefits of Rule 144 promulgated under the 1933 Act or any other similar rule or regulation of the SEC that may at any time permit the Investors to sell securities of the Company to the public without registration ("RULE 144"), the Company agrees to: (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144; (b) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act so long as the Company remains subject to such requirements (it being understood that nothing herein shall limit the Company's obligations under Section 4(c) of the Securities Purchase Agreement) and the filing of such reports and other documents is required for the applicable provisions of Rule 144; and (c) furnish to each Investor so long as such Investor owns Registrable Securities, promptly upon request, (i) a written statement by the Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144, the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act, (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company and such other reports and documents so filed by the Company, and (iii) such other information as may be reasonably requested to permit the investors to sell such securities pursuant to Rule 144 without registration. 9. ASSIGNMENT OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS. The rights under this Agreement shall be automatically assignable by the Investors to any transferee of all or any portion of Registrable Securities if: (i) the Investor agrees in writing with the transferee or assignee to assign such rights, and a copy of such agreement is furnished to the Company within a reasonable time after such transfer or assignment; (ii) the Company is, within a reasonable time after such transfer or assignment, 16
furnished with written notice of (a) the name and address of such transferee or assignee, and (b) the securities with respect to which such registration rights are being transferred or assigned; (iii) immediately following such transfer or assignment the further disposition of such securities by the transferee or assignee is restricted under the 1933 Act and applicable state securities laws; (iv) at or before the time the Company receives the written notice contemplated by clause (ii) of this sentence the transferee or assignee provides the Company with a writing agreeing to be bound by all of the provisions contained herein; and (v) such transfer shall have been made in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Securities Purchase Agreement. 10. AMENDMENT OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS. Provisions of this Agreement may be amended and the observance thereof may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively), only with the written consent of the Company and Investors who then hold a majority of the Registrable Securities. Any amendment or waiver effected in accordance with this Section 10 shall be binding upon each Investor and the Company. No such amendment shall be effective to the extent that it applies to less than all of the holders of the Registrable Securities. No consideration shall be offered or paid to any Person to amend or consent to a waiver or modification of any provision of this Agreement unless the same consideration also is offered to all of the parties to this Agreement. 11. MISCELLANEOUS. (a) A Person is deemed to be a holder of Registrable Securities whenever such Person owns or is deemed to own of record such Registrable Securities. If the Company receives conflicting instructions, notices or elections from two or more Persons with respect to the same Registrable Securities, the Company shall act upon the basis of instructions, notice or election received from the registered owner of such Registrable Securities. (b) Any notices, consents, waivers or other communications required or permitted to be given under the terms of this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been delivered: (i) upon receipt, when delivered personally; (ii) upon receipt, when sent by facsimile (provided confirmation of transmission is mechanically or electronically generated and kept on file by the sending party); or (iii) one (1) Business Day after deposit with an overnight courier service, in each case properly addressed to the party to receive the same.

SCHEDULE OF BUYERS
EXHIBIT A FORM OF NOTICE OF EFFECTIVENESS OF REGISTRATION STATEMENT [TRANSFER AGENT] ATTN: ------------------------------- RE: XCEL ENERGY INC. Ladies and Gentlemen: We are counsel to XCEL ENERGY INC., a Minnesota corporation (the "COMPANY"), and have represented the Company in connection with that certain Securities Purchase Agreement (the "PURCHASE AGREEMENT") entered into by and among the Company and the buyers named therein (collectively, the "HOLDERS") pursuant to which the Company issued to the Holders convertible notes of the Company (the "Notes") convertible into shares of the Company's common stock, par value $2.50 per share (the "COMMON STOCK"). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company also has entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the Holders (the "REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT") pursuant to which the Company agreed, among other things, to register the Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), including the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 ACT"). In connection with the Company's obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement, on ____________ ___, 200__, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-_ (File No. 333-_____________) (the "REGISTRATION STATEMENT") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") relating to the Registrable Securities which names each of the Holders as a selling stockholder thereunder. In connection with the foregoing, we advise you that a member of the SEC's staff has advised us by telephone that the SEC has entered an order declaring the Registration Statement effective under the 1933 Act at [ENTER TIME OF EFFECTIVENESS] on [ENTER DATE OF EFFECTIVENESS] and we have no knowledge, after telephonic inquiry of a member of the SEC's staff, that any stop order suspending its effectiveness has been issued or that any proceedings for that purpose are pending before, or threatened by, the SEC and the Registrable Securities are available for resale under the 1933 Act pursuant to the Registration Statement. Very truly yours, [ISSUER'S COUNSEL] By: -------------------------------- cc: [LIST HOLDERS]
