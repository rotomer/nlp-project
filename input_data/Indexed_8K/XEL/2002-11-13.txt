Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business and is in good standing in every jurisdiction in which its ownership of property or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" means any material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, operations, results of operations, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on the transactions contemplated hereby or by the agreements and instruments to be entered into in connection herewith, or on the authority or ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents (as defined below). The Company has no Subsidiaries except as set forth in the SEC Documents (as defined below). (b) Authorization; Enforcement; Validity. The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Notes, the Registration Rights Agreement, the Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions (as defined in Section 5) and each of the other agreements entered into by the parties hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS") and to issue the Securities in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof. The execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including without limitation the issuance of the Notes and the reservation for issuance and the issuance of the Conversion Shares issuable upon conversion thereof, have been duly authorized by the Company's Board of Directors and no further consent or authorization is required by the Company, its Board of Directors or its stockholders. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents of even date herewith have been duly executed and delivered by the Company, and constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in 9
accordance with their terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by general principles of equity or applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, liquidation or similar laws relating to, or affecting generally, the enforcement of creditors' rights and remedies. (c) Issuance of Securities. The Notes are duly authorized and, upon issuance in accordance with the terms hereof, shall be free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof. At least 115% of the number of shares of Common Stock necessary to satisfy all of the Company's obligations pursuant to the First Notes and Second Notes have been duly authorized and reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Notes. Upon conversion in accordance with the Notes, the Conversion Shares will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof, with the holders being entitled to all rights accorded to a holder of Common Stock. Assuming the accuracy of the representations, warranties and covenants of the Buyers set forth herein, the issuance by the Company of the Securities is exempt from registration under the 1933 Act. (d) No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction Documents by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including, without limitation, the issuance of the Notes and reservation for issuance and issuance of the Conversion Shares) will not (i) result in a violation of the certificate of incorporation, any certificate of designations, preferences and rights of any outstanding series of preferred stock or bylaws of the Company or any Subsidiary or (ii) conflict with, or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, any material agreement, indenture or instrument to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or (iii) result in a violation of any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree (including federal and state utilities and securities laws and regulations and the rules and regulations of the Principal Market (as defined below)) applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or affected. (e) Consents. Except as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, the Company is not required to obtain any consent, authorization or order of, or make any filing or registration with, any court, governmental agency or any regulatory or self-regulatory agency or any other Person in order for it to execute, deliver or perform any of its obligations under or contemplated by the Transaction Documents, in each case in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof, except for such consents, authorizations, orders, filings and registrations which have been obtained or effected on or prior to the date hereof. The Company and its Subsidiaries are unaware of any facts or circumstances which might prevent the Company from obtaining or effecting any of the foregoing. The Company is not in violation of the listing requirements of the Principal Market and has no actual knowledge of any facts which would reasonably lead to delisting or suspension of the Common Stock in the foreseeable future.

The Company shall not, in any manner, issue or sell any rights, warrants or options to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock or directly or indirectly convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock at a price which varies or may vary with the market price of the Common Stock, including by way of one or more reset(s) to any fixed price unless the conversion, exchange or exercise price of any such security cannot be less than the then applicable Conversion Price (as defined in the Notes) under any Note. (o) Proxy Statement. If the Company at any time determines that in connection with the issuance of the Securities, Stockholder Approval is required by the Principal Market in connection with the Exchange Cap (as defined in the Notes), the Company shall provide each stockholder entitled to vote at the next meeting of stockholders of the Company, which meeting shall occur on or before ninety days from the date of such determination (the "STOCKHOLDER MEETING DEADLINE"), a proxy statement, which has been previously reviewed by the Buyers and a counsel of their choice, soliciting each such stockholder's affirmative vote at such stockholder meeting for approval of the Company's issuance of all of the Securities as described in the Transaction Documents in accordance with applicable law and the rules and regulations of the Principal Market (such affirmative approval being referred to herein as the "STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL"), and the Company shall use its best efforts to solicit its stockholders' approval of such issuance of the Securities and to cause the Board of Directors of the Company to recommend to the stockholders that they approve such proposal. The Company shall be obligated to obtain the Stockholder Approval by the Stockholder Meeting Deadline. 5. REGISTER; TRANSFER AGENT INSTRUCTIONS. (a) Register. The Company shall maintain at its principal executive offices (or such other office or agency of the Company as it may designate by notice to each holder of Notes), a register for the Notes, in which the Company shall record the name and address of the Person in whose name the Notes have been issued (including the name and address of each 20
transferee) and the amount of Notes held by such Person. The Company shall keep the register open and available at all times during business hours for inspection of any Buyer or its legal representatives. (b) Transfer Agent Instructions. The Company shall issue irrevocable instructions to its transfer agent, and any subsequent transfer agent, to issue certificates or credit shares to the applicable balance accounts at DTC, registered in the name of each Buyer or its respective nominee(s), for the Conversion Shares in such amounts as specified from time to time by each Buyer to the Company upon conversion of the Notes in the form of Exhibit I attached hereto (the "IRREVOCABLE TRANSFER AGENT INSTRUCTIONS"). The Company warrants that no instruction other than the Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions referred to in this Section 5(b), and stop transfer instructions to give effect to Section 2(f) hereof will be given by the Company to its transfer agent, and that the Securities shall otherwise be freely transferable on the books and records of the Company as and to the extent provided in this Agreement, the Notes and the Registration Rights Agreement. If a Buyer effects a sale, assignment or transfer of the Securities in accordance with Section 2(f), the Company shall permit the transfer, and shall promptly instruct its transfer agent to issue one or more certificates or credit shares to the applicable balance accounts at DTC in such name and in such denominations as specified by such Buyer to effect such sale, transfer or assignment. In the event that such sale, assignment or transfer involves Conversion Shares sold, assigned or transferred pursuant to an effective registration statement or pursuant to Rule 144, the transfer agent shall issue such Securities to the Buyer, assignee or transferee, as the case may be, without any restrictive legend.

(k) Indemnification. In consideration of each Buyer's execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents and acquiring the Securities thereunder and in addition to all of 34
the Company's other obligations under the Transaction Documents, the Company shall defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless each Buyer and each other holder of the Securities and all of their stockholders, partners, members, officers, directors, employees and direct or indirect investors and any of the foregoing Persons' agents or other representatives (including, without limitation, those retained in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (collectively, the "INDEMNITEES") from and against any and all actions, causes of action, suits, claims, losses, costs, penalties, fees, liabilities and damages, and expenses in connection therewith (irrespective of whether any such Indemnitee is a party to the action for which indemnification hereunder is sought), and including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements (the "INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES"), incurred by any Indemnitee as a result of, or arising out of, or relating to (a) any misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company in the Transaction Documents or any other certificate, instrument or document contemplated hereby or thereby, (b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation of the Company contained in the Transaction Documents or any other certificate, instrument or document contemplated hereby or thereby or (c) any cause of action, suit or claim brought or made against such Indemnitee by a third party (including for these purposes a derivative action brought on behalf of the Company) and arising out of or resulting from (i) the execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of the Transaction Documents or any other certificate, instrument or document contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) any transaction financed or to be financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, with the proceeds of the issuance of the Securities, (iii) any disclosure made by such Buyer pursuant to Section 4(j), or (iv) the status of such Buyer or holder of the Securities as an investor in the Company. To the extent that the foregoing undertaking by the Company may be unenforceable for any reason, the Company shall make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the Indemnified Liabilities which is permissible under applicable law. Except as otherwise set forth herein, the mechanics and procedures with respect to the rights and obligations under this Section 9(k) shall be the same as those set forth in Section 6 of the Registration Rights Agreement. (l) No Strict Construction. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rules of strict construction will be applied against any party. (m) Remedies. Each Buyer and each holder of the Securities shall have all rights and remedies set forth in the Transaction Documents and all rights and remedies which such holders have been granted at any time under any other agreement or contract and all of the rights which such holders have under any law. Any Person having any rights under any provision of this Agreement shall be entitled to enforce such rights specifically (without posting a bond or other security), to recover damages by reason of any breach of any provision of this Agreement and to exercise all other rights granted by law. Furthermore, the Company recognizes that in the event that it fails to perform, observe, or discharge any or all of its obligations under this Agreement, any remedy at law may prove to be inadequate relief to the Buyers. The Company therefore agrees that the Buyers shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief in any such case without the necessity of proving actual damages and without posting a bond or other security. (n) Payment Set Aside. To the extent that the Company makes a payment or 35
payments to the Buyers hereunder or pursuant to any of the other Transaction Documents or the Buyers enforce or exercise their rights hereunder or thereunder, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or exercise or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, recovered from, disgorged by or are required to be refunded, repaid or otherwise restored to the Company, a trustee, receiver or any other Person under any law (including, without limitation, any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause of action), then to the extent of any such restoration the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.
