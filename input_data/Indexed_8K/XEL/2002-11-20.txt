November 19, 2002
     MINNEAPOLIS Xcel Energy, Inc. (NYSE: XEL), announced today that it agreed to issue $200 million through a private offering of convertible senior notes with a coupon of 7.5 percent. The senior notes are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $12.33 and mature in 2007. The conversion price represents a 25-percent premium over the $9.86 closing price of the Company's stock today. Xcel Energy anticipates that the transaction will close on Nov. 21, 2002. Xcel Energy also has granted the initial purchasers a 30-day over-allotment for up to 15 percent of the amount of this offering.
     The offering was made only to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. A portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes will be used to redeem on January 8, 2003, the $100-million principal amount of 8 percent convertible senior notes issued on November 8, 2002. The remaining net proceeds will be used for other general corporate purposes, including working capital.
     The securities to be offered have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or any state securities laws, and unless so registered may not be offered or sold in the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and applicable state securities laws.
