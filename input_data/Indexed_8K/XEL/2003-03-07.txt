On Feb. 26, 2003, Fortistar Capital, Inc. and Fortistar Methane, LLC filed a lawsuit in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of New York against Xcel Energy Inc. and five former NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG) or NEO Corporation employees. NRG is a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy, and NEO Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of NRG. In the lawsuit, Fortistar claims that the defendants violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and committed fraud by engaging in a pattern of negotiating and executing agreements "they intended not to comply with" and "made false statements later to conceal their fraudulent promises." The allegations against Xcel Energy are, for the most part, limited to purported activities related to the contract for the Pike Energy power facility in Mississippi and statements related to an "equity infusion" into NRG by Xcel Energy. Xcel Energy believes these allegations are completely unfounded and the lawsuit is without merit.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
