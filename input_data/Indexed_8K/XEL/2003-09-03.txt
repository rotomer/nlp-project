Item 5. Other Events
Xcel Energy has completed its evaluation of additional tax benefits that are available related to its investment in NRG. This evaluation included an analysis of potential state tax effects of the NRG investment write-off and refinements of Xcel Energy's tax basis calculations. Xcel Energy plans to record $105 million of additional tax benefits in its third quarter 2003 results, which will increase Xcel Energy's cumulative income tax benefits related to its investment in NRG to $811 million.
On September 4, 2003, Xcel Energy will present information regarding Xcel Energy's recent results of operations and financial condition. The presentation contains material, non-public information. In addition, it contains financial measures, which are not based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These measures have adjusted GAAP earnings guidance to reflect the impact of historic and expected future events, which management believes to be more indicative of future earnings performance. The pro-forma information reflects the future divestiture of NRG Energy, Inc. expected as a result of its bankruptcy filing and financial restructuring. The measures also reflect the divestiture of Viking Gas Transmission, which was sold in January 2003.
See additional information in the presentation furnished as exhibit 99.01.
