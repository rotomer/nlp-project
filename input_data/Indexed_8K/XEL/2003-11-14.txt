Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On November 17, 2003, Xcel Energy will present information regarding Xcel Energy's recent results of operations and financial condition. The presentation contains material, non-public information. In addition, it contains financial measures, which are not based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These measures have adjusted GAAP earnings guidance to reflect the impact of historic and expected future events, which management believes to be more indicative of future earnings performance. The pro-forma information reflects the future divestiture of NRG Energy, Inc. expected as a result of its bankruptcy filing and financial restructuring. The measures also reflect the divestiture of Viking Gas Transmission, which was sold in January 2003.
See additional information in the presentation furnished as exhibit 99.01.
