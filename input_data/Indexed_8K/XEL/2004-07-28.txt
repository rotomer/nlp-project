Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
July 28, 2004
MINNEAPOLIS  Xcel Energy Inc. (NYSE: XEL) reported income from continuing operations of $81 million, or 20 cents per share on a diluted basis, for the second quarter of 2004, compared with $55 million, or 13 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2003.
Net income for the quarter was $86 million, or 21 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2004, compared with net losses of $283 million, or 71 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2003.
Xcel Energy's net income for the second quarter included the following:
The improvement in 2004 earnings from continuing operations is primarily attributable to lower depreciation expense, better results from nonregulated subsidiaries, higher short-term wholesale margins and retail electric sales growth, partially offset by higher utility operating and maintenance expenses, as expected.
"Our second quarter earnings are on track with our business plan, and we are maintaining our annual earnings guidance of $1.15 to $1.25 per share," said Wayne H. Brunetti, chairman and chief executive officer. "We've delivered two solid quarters, and just last week our shareholders received their dividend checks, which reflect the increased annual dividend of 8 cents per share. This increased dividend was approved by our Board of Directors in May based on their confidence in our strategy of building the core utility operations."
At 9 a.m. CDT today, Xcel Energy will host a conference call to review second quarter financial results. To participate in the conference call, please dial in five to 10 minutes prior to the scheduled start and follow the operator's instructions.

Due to the seasonality of Xcel Energy's operating results, quarterly financial results are not an appropriate base from which to project annual results.
Note 1. Earnings Per Share Summary
The following table summarizes the earnings-per-share contributions of Xcel Energy's businesses.
The following table highlights significant components contributing to the changes in the three months ended June 30, 2004 and the first six months of 2004 earnings per share, compared with the same periods in 2003, which are discussed in more detail later in this release.
Note 2. Regulated Utility Segment Results  Continuing Operations
 The following summarizes the estimated impact of temperature variations on utility results included in continuing operations, compared with sales under normal weather conditions.
Estimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings
 
 The following table summarizes Xcel Energy's regulated utility growth from continuing operations for actual and weather-normalized energy sales for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2004, compared with the same periods in 2003.
Sales Growth
 The following table details the changes in revenues, costs and margins (including the trading activity that is reported net on the income statement) from Xcel Energy's electric utility and commodity trading operations that are included in continuing operations.
Electric Utility and Commodity Trading Margins
Note  The wholesale and trading margins in the above table reflect the estimated impacts of the regulatory sharing of certain margins under the energy cost adjustment mechanisms in Colorado.
 
Base electric utility margins, which are primarily derived from retail customer sales, decreased approximately $1 million for the second quarter of 2004, compared with the second quarter of 2003, and remained constant for the first six months of 2004 compared with the first six months of 2003. The relatively flat margins are a result of the following:
Short-term wholesale margins consist of asset-based electric sales for resale. Electric commodity trading margins consist of non-asset-based purchases and sales. Short-term wholesale and electric commodity trading margins increased approximately $14 million during the second quarter of 2004 compared with the second quarter of 2003. Second quarter 2004 short-term wholesale results reflect a number of market factors, including higher market prices and additional resources available for sale.
Short-term wholesale margins increased $35 million for the first six months of 2004 compared with the same period in 2003. The higher results reflect a number of market factors, including higher market prices, additional resources available for sale in the second quarter of 2004 and a pre-existing contract, which expired in the first quarter of 2004. A comparable contract was not in place in the first half of 2003.
 Other operating and maintenance expenses for the second quarter of 2004 increased by approximately $14 million, or 3.8 percent, compared with the same period in 2003. The increase is primarily due to higher reliability costs of $6 million, lower pension credits of $5 million, higher information technology expense of $2 million and costs associated with the implementation of a new customer billing system of $2 million. The higher costs are partially offset by lower restricted stock expense related to the 2003 grant of $9 million. In second quarter 2004, no restricted stock expense was recorded.
Other Operating and Maintenance Expenses  Utility
Other operating and maintenance expenses for the first six months of 2004 increased $31 million, or 4.0 percent, compared with the same period in 2003. The increase is primarily due to lower pension credits of $12 million, higher medical and health insurance costs of $6 million, higher reliability costs of $6 million, higher information technology expense of $6 million, costs associated with the implementation of a new customer billing system of $2 million and higher transmission system costs of $2 million. The higher costs are partially offset by lower plant outage costs of $9 million.
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by approximately $26 million, or 12.8 percent, for the second quarter of 2004, compared with the second quarter of 2003. Depreciation and amortization expense for the six months ended June 30, 2004, decreased $42 million, or 10.5 percent, compared with the six months ended June 30, 2003. During the second quarter of 2003, $10 million of depreciation expense was recorded for renewable development fund costs, which are largely recovered through NSP-Minnesota's fuel clause rate adjustment mechanism
Depreciation and Amortization
During 2003, the Minnesota Legislature authorized additional spent nuclear fuel storage at the Prairie Island nuclear plant. In December 2003, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) extended the authorized useful lives of the two generating units at the Prairie Island nuclear plant, retroactive to Jan. 1, 2003. The 2003 annual reduction was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003. Annual depreciation expense for 2004 is expected to be approximately $18 million lower than 2003, due to a change in the decommissioning accruals resulting from a related MPUC order.
 
In addition, effective July 1, 2003, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) lengthened the depreciable lives of certain electric utility plant at PSCo as a part of the general Colorado rate case, which will reduce annual depreciation expense by $20 million.
 Interest charges and financing costs decreased $14 million, or 11.6 percent, for the second quarter of 2004, compared with the same period in 2003, and $21 million, or 8.9 percent, for the six month period ended June 30, 2004, compared with the same period in 2003. The decreases reflect savings from refinancing higher coupon debt during 2003.
Interest Charges and Financing Costs
 Income taxes increased by $14 million during the second quarter of 2004 compared with the same period in 2003. The increase was primarily due to increased pretax income in 2004 and a lower effective tax rate in 2003. The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 14.0 percent for the second quarter of 2004, compared with (2.2) percent for the same period in 2003. The second quarter 2004 effective rate is higher than in 2003 due to adjustments recorded in 2003 relating to state tax accruals and favorable income tax audit settlements. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2004 is lower than the forecasted 2004 annual rate due mainly to a larger ratio of tax credits to lower pretax income levels.
Income Taxes
Income taxes increased for the six months ended June 30, 2004, compared with June 30, 2003, by $23 million. The increase was primarily due to increased pretax income in 2004. The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 26.9 percent for the period ended June 30, 2004, compared with 24.7 percent for the same period in 2003. The increased rate in 2004 is due mainly to adjustments in the second quarter of 2003, discussed above.
Note 3. Nonregulated and Holding Company Results  Continuing Operations
The following table summarizes the earnings-per-share contributions of the continuing operations of Xcel Energy's nonregulated businesses and holding company.
 Seren operates a combination cable television, telephone and high-speed Internet access system in St. Cloud, Minn., and Contra Costa County, California. Operation of its broadband communications network has resulted in losses. Seren has completed its build-out phase and has been experiencing improvement in its operating results. On June 30, 2004, Xcel Energy's investment in Seren was approximately $256 million.
Seren
 Nonregulated and holding company results include interest expense and preferred dividend costs, which are incurred at the Xcel Energy and intermediate holding company levels and are not directly assigned to individual subsidiaries.
Financing Costs and Preferred Dividends
 Other nonregulated results improved for the second quarter of 2004 and the six months ended June 30, 2004, compared with the same periods in 2003 due to 2003 restructuring charges related to NRG and to reduced losses at Planergy and Utility Engineering. The restructuring charges, related to NRG, were incurred by Xcel Energy and are not considered discontinued operations. The majority of Planergy's operations were closed in 2003 with the remaining operating units sold in December 2003 and January 2004. In the second quarter of 2003, Utility Engineering experienced losses related to fixed costs in excess of project income and project write downs, which did not recur in 2004.
Other Nonregulated Results
 
Note 4. Discontinued Operations
A summary of the earnings per share components of discontinued operations is as follows:
 During January 2004, Xcel Energy reached an agreement to sell its regulated electric and natural gas subsidiary Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power Company (CLF&P). As a result of this agreement, Xcel Energy is reporting CLF&P results as a component of discontinued operations for all periods presented. The sale is pending regulatory approval and is expected to be completed in 2004.
Discontinued Utility Operations
During 2003, Xcel Energy completed the sale of two subsidiaries in its regulated natural gas utility segment, Black Mountain Gas (BMG) and Viking Gas Transmission Co. (Viking), including Viking's interest in Guardian Pipeline, LLC. As a result, a gain of 5 cents per share was recorded in the first quarter of 2003, related to the sale of Viking. The BMG sale was completed in the third quarter of 2003.
 Xcel Energy's share of NRG's results for 2003 and prior periods are reported as a component of discontinued operations due to NRG's emergence from bankruptcy in December 2003 and Xcel Energy's corresponding relinquishment of its ownership interest in NRG.
Discontinued Nonregulated Operations  NRG
 During 2003, the board of directors of Xcel Energy approved management's plan to exit businesses conducted by Xcel Energy International, Inc. (Xcel Energy International) and e prime, Inc. (e prime). Xcel Energy International's operations primarily include power generation projects in Argentina. e prime provided energy-related products and services, which included natural gas commodity trading and marketing and energy consulting. The exit of all business conducted by e prime was completed in 2004.
Discontinued Nonregulated Operations  Other Subsidiaries
During the first quarter of 2004, Xcel Energy completed the sale of one of its Argentina subsidiaries, Hidroelectrica del Sur S.A. (HDS). The sale price of HDS was immaterial and approximated the book value of Xcel Energy's investment in HDS.
On June 3, 2004, Xcel Energy sold another of its Argentina subsidiaries, Corporacion Independiente de Energia S.A. (CIESA), which has as its primary asset a 620-megawatt gas/oil-fired facility in Argentina. The sale also included the stock of IPC Operations Limited, an energy services company with operations in Argentina. The total purchase price was approximately $26 million. Approximately $15 million of the purchase price has been placed in escrow, which is expected to remain in place until the first quarter of 2005, to support customary indemnity obligations under the purchase agreement. In addition to the purchase price, Xcel Argentina also received approximately $21 million at closing as a redemption of its capital from CIESA. The sale resulted in an after-tax gain of $6.1 million, or 1 cent per share, in the second quarter of 2004. The gain includes the realization of $6.9 million of tax benefits related to the now-realizable tax loss from disposition of Xcel Argentina assets.
Xcel Energy International is in the process of marketing its remaining assets and operations to prospective buyers and expects to exit the businesses during 2004.
 
Note 5. Xcel Energy Liquidity
 As of July 20, 2004, Xcel Energy had the following credit facilities available to meet its liquidity needs:
Xcel Energy and Utility Subsidiary Credit Facilities
*Includes short-term borrowings and letters of credit.
The liquidity table above reflects the payment of common dividends on July 20, 2004.
NSP-Wisconsin has approval from the Wisconsin Public Service Commission to borrow up to $50 million in short-term debt from either external financial institutions or NSP-Minnesota. Currently, NSP-Wisconsin borrows on a short-term basis through an intercompany borrowing agreement with NSP-Minnesota. At July 20, 2004, NSP-Wisconsin had $5.7 million in short-term borrowings from NSP-Minnesota and no short-term investments.
NSP-Minnesota replaced its $275 million secured credit facility, which expired in May 2004, with a $300 million unsecured, 364-day credit agreement. PSCo replaced its $350 million secured credit facility, which expired in May 2004, with a $350 million unsecured, 364-day credit agreement. Both new facilities include a term-out provision and one financial ratio covenant in the form of a debt to total capitalization ratio.
 Following is the preliminary capital structure of Xcel Energy at June 30, 2004:
Capital Structure
*Includes current portion of long-term debt.
Note 6. Rates and Regulation
 On April 30, 2004, PSCo filed its least-cost resource plan (LCP) with the CPUC. PSCo has identified that it needs to provide for 3,600 megawatts of capacity through 2013 to meet load growth and replace expiring contracts. The LCP identifies the resources necessary to meet PSCo's estimated load requirements. Of the amount needed, PSCo believes 2,000 megawatts will come from new resources and 1,600 megawatts will come from entering into new contracts with existing suppliers whose contracts expire during the resource acquisition period.
PSCo Least Cost Resource Plan
As part of its resource plan, PSCo is seeking the waiver of certain CPUC rules, which would allow it to build a new 750-megawatt coal-fired unit at its existing Comanche power plant site located in Pueblo, Colorado. PSCo plans to own 500 megawatts of this new facility. Two of PSCo's wholesale customers have options to participate in the ownership of the remaining 250 megawatts, and PSCo is in discussions with them regarding the plant's development.
 
On April 30, 2004, PSCo also filed an application requesting a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the new coal unit. PSCo also filed a separate application for a specific regulatory plan to address the impacts of purchased capacity contracts on its capital structure and to accelerate the recovery of the costs of financing the new power plant and related transmission prior to commercial operations. The CPUC has consolidated these three applications and has scheduled hearings in November 2004. A decision is expected in late 2004 or early 2005. The procedural schedule is as follows:
The CPUC is expected to decide in a separate docket PSCo's request for approval of a 500-megawatt renewable energy solicitation with a hearing scheduled for August 2004.
- In October 2003, PSCo filed an application to recover incremental capacity costs through a purchased capacity cost adjustment (PCCA) rider. The PCCA will recover purchased capacity payments to power suppliers that are not included in the determination of PSCo's base electric rates determined in its 2002 general rate case or other recovery mechanisms. In May 2004, the CPUC granted the PSCo PCCA application in part with new rates effective June 1, 2004. Primary provisions of the CPUC ruling include a capped PCCA recovery for the period June 1, 2004 through Dec. 31, 2006 at PSCo's current predicted capacity payments for a group of specific contracts, which will provide recovery of $20.4 million in 2004, $33.5 million in 2005 and $19.8 million in 2006. In addition, it excluded seven of the existing contracts from incremental recovery under the PCCA calculation.
PSCo Capacity Cost Adjustment
 As a part of PSCo's annual electric earnings test, the CPUC has opened a docket to consider whether PSCo's cost of debt has been adversely affected by the financial difficulties at NRG and, if so, whether any adjustments to PSCo's cost of capital are appropriate. In its earnings test for 2002, PSCo did not earn above its allowed authorized return on equity and, accordingly, has not recorded any refund obligations. There was no earnings test for 2003.
PSCo Electric Department Earning Test Proceedings
On May 28, 2004, the CPUC staff and the Office of Consumer Counsel (OCC) filed testimony recommending the CPUC order the use of a pro forma regulatory adjustment to the cost of debt, on $600 million of debt issued by PSCo in September 2002, reducing the cost of debt in this and future proceedings. The CPUC staff recommendation would result in an exclusion of interest costs of $12 million and the OCC recommendation would result in an exclusion of $17 million. PSCo does not anticipate its 2002 earnings will be above its allowed authorized return on equity with these recommended changes in the cost of debt. Hearings are scheduled in October 2004.
- The PSCo quality of service plan (QSP) provides for bill credits to Colorado retail customers, if PSCo does not achieve certain operational performance targets. During the second quarter of 2004, PSCo filed its calendar year 2003 operating performance results for electric service unavailability, phone response time, customer complaints, accurate meter reading and gas leak repair time measures. PSCo did not achieve the 2003 performance targets for the electric service unavailability measure or the customer complaint measure. Additionally, PSCo filed revisions to its previously filed 2002 electric QSP results for the service unavailability measure. Based on the revised results, PSCo did not achieve the 2002 performance targets for the electric service unavailability measure, creating a bill credit obligation for 2002 and increasing the maximum bill credit obligation for subsequent years' performance.
PSCo Quality of Service Plan
 
As of Dec. 31, 2003, PSCo had accrued an aggregate estimated bill credit obligation of $6.4 million for the 2002 and 2003 calendar years. Based on the updated information and filings discussed above, during second quarter of 2004, PSCo increased its estimated bill credit liability for these years to $13.4 million. The CPUC's final approval of the achieved performance measures for 2002 and 2003 is pending. For calendar year 2004, PSCo has evaluated its year to date performance under the QSP and has recorded an additional liability of $5.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2004. Under the electric QSP, the estimated maximum potential bill credit obligation for calendar 2004 performance is approximately $15.2 million, assuming none of the performance targets are met.
