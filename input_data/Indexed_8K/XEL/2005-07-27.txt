Exhibit 99.01
 
 
July 27, 2005
 
MINNEAPOLIS  Xcel Energy Inc. (NYSE: XEL) announced income from continuing operations of $78 million, or 19 cents per share on a diluted basis, for the second quarter of 2005 compared with $86 million, or 21 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2004.
 
Total earnings for the quarter, which include the impact of discontinued operations, were $83 million, or 20 cents per share, in 2005, compared with $86 million, or 21 cents per share, in 2004.
 
Xcel Energy's total earnings for the second quarter of 2005 included the following:
 
 - 
                 
Regulated utility earnings from continuing operations were $94 million, or 22 cents per share, compared with $89 million, or 21 cents per share, in 2004;
 - 
                 
Nonregulated subsidiary and holding company losses from continuing operations were $13 million, or 3 cents per share, compared with a loss of $0.5 million, or 0 cents per share in 2004; and
 - 
                 
Results from discontinued operations were earnings of $5 million, or 1 cent per share, compared with income of $0.8 million, or 0 cents per share, in 2004.
 
While regulated earnings improved during the quarter, total earnings declined by 1 cent per share, when compared with the same period last year.  Regulated earnings for the second quarter of 2005 increased due to higher electric margins resulting from favorable weather in 2005 compared with unfavorable weather in 2004 and sales growth, particularly in the northern regions.  Partially offsetting the increase were increased operating and maintenance expense, primarily attributable to a planned nuclear outage and higher depreciation expense resulting from major plant and software additions completed in 2004 and early 2005.
 
"The company's results are in line with our objectives for the quarter and the year," said Richard C. Kelly, president and chief executive officer.  "The performance of our power plants and transmission and distribution systems have met or exceeded expectations during an extended heat wave that began in the latter half of June and has extended into July.   We are also moving forward with our strategy of investing in our core businesses while improving environmental performance.  We have broken ground on the first phase of our Minnesota Metro Emissions Reduction Project, and we received air permits for our Comanche 3 coal plant in Colorado and expect to start construction later this fall.   Overall, we are pleased with our year-to-date performance and we are maintaining our 2005 earnings guidance of $1.18 to $1.28 per share from continuing operations."

Notes to Investor Relations Release (Unaudited)
 
Due to the seasonality of Xcel Energy's operating results, quarterly financial results are not an appropriate base from which to project annual results.
 
Note 1.  Earnings per Share Summary
 
The following table summarizes the earnings-per-share contributions of Xcel Energy's businesses.
 
 
The following table summarizes significant components contributing to the changes in the second quarter and year-to-date 2005 earnings per share compared with the same periods in 2004, which are discussed in more detail later in the release.
 
 
Note 2.  Regulated Utility Segment Results  Continuing Operations
 
The following summarizes the estimated impact of temperature variations on utility results included in continuing operations, compared with sales under normal weather conditions.
Estimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings
 
 The following table summarizes Xcel Energy's regulated utility growth from continuing operations for actual and weather-normalized energy sales for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2005, compared with the same period in 2004.
Sales Growth
 
The following table details the revenue and margin for base electric utility, short-term wholesale and commodity trading activities that are included in continuing operations:
Base Electric Utility, Short-term Wholesale and
Commodity Trading Margins
 
 
Note  The short-term wholesale and commodity trading results in the above table reflect the estimated impacts of the regulatory sharing of certain margins.
 
Base electric utility margins, which are primarily derived from retail customer sales, increased approximately $60 million for the second quarter of 2005, compared with the second quarter of 2004.  Base electric utility margins increased approximately $71 million for the first six months of 2005 compared with the same period in 2004.  For more information see the following table:
Base Electric Utility Margin
 
 
Short-term wholesale margins consist of energy-related purchase and sales activity and the use of certain financial instruments associated with the fuel required for and energy produced from Xcel Energy's generation assets and energy and capacity purchased to serve native load.  Commodity trading margins are not associated with Xcel Energy's generation assets or the capacity and energy purchased to serve native load.
 
Short-term wholesale and commodity trading margins decreased approximately $23 million for the first six months of 2005 compared with the same period in 2004.  The 2004 short-term wholesale results reflect the impact of higher trading volumes and a preexisting contract, which contributed $17 million in the first quarter of 2004 and expired at that time.
 
 Other operating and maintenance expenses for the second quarter of 2005 increased by approximately $45 million, or 11.4 percent, compared with the same period in 2004.  The increase is primarily due to a planned nuclear plant refueling and upgrade outage in 2005, with no comparable outage in the second quarter of 2004, which increased costs by approximately $20 million.  In addition, employee benefit costs increased approximately $10 million compared with 2004, and performance-based compensation costs were approximately $7 million higher in 2005 than 2004.  The accruals for these performance-based plans fluctuate based on Xcel Energy's stock price, which can create variances on a quarter-to-quarter basis.
Other Operating and Maintenance Expenses  Utility
 
Other operating and maintenance expenses for the first six months of 2005 increased $54 million, or 6.8 percent, compared with the same period in 2004.  Two nuclear plant refueling, inspection and upgrade outages in 2005, with no comparable outages in the first six months of 2004, increased costs by approximately $44 million.  In addition, employee benefit costs were approximately $14 million higher in 2005 than 2004.  The increases were partially offset by lower maintenance costs at the fossil-fuel plants of approximately $10 million.
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately $20 million, or 11.8 percent, for the second quarter, and $43 million, or 12.4 percent, for the first six-months of 2005, when compared with the same periods in 2004.  These changes were primarily due to the installation of new steam generators at the Prairie Island nuclear plant and software system additions in 2004 and early 2005, both of which have relatively short depreciable lives compared with other capital additions.  In addition, depreciation expense increased for other plant additions.
Depreciation and Amortization
 
 Income taxes for continuing operations increased by $9 million for the second quarter of 2005 compared with the same period in 2004.  The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 24.0 percent for the second quarter of 2005, compared with 15.7 percent for the same period in 2004.  Additional income tax expense was recorded in the second quarter of 2005 to eliminate the difference in tax expense computed based on the actual year-to-date effective tax rate at the subsidiary level as compared to the forecasted annual consolidated effective tax rate.  Second quarter 2005 and second quarter 2004 had lower actual effective tax rates as compared to forecast due to a variation in the year-to-date levels and mix of income earned in various jurisdictions with different tax rates.
Income Taxes
Income taxes for continuing operations decreased by $18 million for the first six months of 2005 compared with the same period in 2004.  The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 25.6 percent for the first six months of 2005, compared with 27.3 percent for the same period in 2004.  The decrease in the effective tax rate was due to additional tax credits and lower pretax income levels for the first six months of 2005 as compared with the same period in 2004, partially offset by the additional income tax expense recorded, as discussed above.
 
Note 3.  Xcel Energy Capital Structure
 
Following is the preliminary capital structure of Xcel Energy at June 30, 2005:
 
 
On July 21, 2005, Northern States Power Co., a Minnesota corporation (NSP-Minnesota) issued $250 million of first mortgage bonds.  The bonds mature in 2035 and have a coupon interest rate of 5.25 percent.  NSP-Minnesota intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the first mortgage bonds to repay borrowings under its credit facility and approximately $75 million of debt maturing during 2005.
 
Note 4.  Rates and Regulation
 
- In September 2004, NSP-Minnesota filed a natural gas rate case for its Minnesota retail customers, seeking a rate increase of $9.9 million, based on a return on equity of 11.5 percent.  Interim rates collecting $6.4 million per year were implemented December 1, 2004, subject to refund.
NSP-Minnesota Natural Gas Rate Case
 
On April 19, 2005, NSP-Minnesota and the Department of Commerce filed with an administrative law judge and the MPUC an offer of settlement related to the natural gas rate case.  The settlement agreement includes an annual rate increase of $5.8 million, based on a return on equity of 10.4 percent.  The settlement also reflects an increase in the residential customer charge from $6.50 to $8.00 per month.  The administrative law judge issued a report to the MPUC recommending approval of the settlement agreement.  The Office of the Attorney General filed exceptions to the report regarding the residential customer charge issue.  On July 21, 2005, the MPUC voted to approve the settlement agreement with one slight modification on the reconnection fee that does not impact the revenue deficiency.  A final order is expected by Aug. 22, 2005.
 
- On June 1, 2005, Northern States Power Co., a Wisconsin corporation (NSP-Wisconsin) filed a general rate case application for 2006, in accordance with the biennial rate case-filing schedule established by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW).  In the application, NSP-Wisconsin requested an increase of $40.8 million, or 10.3 percent, for the Wisconsin retail electric jurisdiction, and an increase of $7 million, or 4.4 percent, for the Wisconsin natural gas jurisdiction.  The indicated revenue deficiencies are based on a 2006 test year, the currently authorized 11.90 percent return on equity and a common equity ratio of 56.32 percent.  The increase is necessary to maintain and improve existing facilities, as well as to invest in new facilities to meet growing customer needs.  Also contributing to the electric increase are rising fuel and purchased power costs.  NSP-Wisconsin has requested the new rates be effective Jan. 1, 2006.  On July 22, 2005, the PSCW held a pre-hearing conference.  Hearings were scheduled for November 2005.
NSP-Wisconsin 2006 General Rate Case
 In December 2004, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approved a settlement agreement between Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo) and many intervening parties concerning its future resource plan.  As a part of the settlement the CPUC approved PSCo's plan to construct a 750-megawatt net output pulverized coal-fired unit at the Comanche Station located near Pueblo, Colo.
PSCo Resource Plan
 
On July 5, 2005, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment issued final air quality permits for the new coal-fired unit, as well as additional emission controls on Comanche's two existing units. Construction on the plant is planned to commence in the fall of 2005.
 
 On May 27, 2005, PSCo filed for an increase of natural gas base rates in Colorado. The proposed increase, factoring in current costs of natural gas, would increase overall customer bills by approximately $34 million, or 3 percent annually.  PSCo supplemented its filing with the CPUC on July 8, 2005.  The CPUC has scheduled a prehearing conference for Aug. 3, 2005.  It is anticipated that the request, if approved by the CPUC, would become effective early in 2006.
PSCo Natural Gas Rate Case
 
Note 5.  Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures
 
 On Sept. 27, 2004, Xcel Energy's board of directors approved management's plan to pursue the sale of Seren Innovations, Inc., a wholly owned broadband communications services subsidiary. Seren delivers cable television, high-speed Internet and telephone service over an advanced network to approximately 46,000 customers in St. Cloud, Minn., and Concord and Walnut Creek, Calif.
Seren
 
As a result of the sales agreements, the total after-tax impairment charge related to Seren, including disposition charges, was $138 million, which was recorded primarily in 2004.
In May 2005, Xcel Energy also reached an agreement to sell Seren's California assets to WaveDivision Holdings.  In July 2005, Xcel Energy reached an agreement to sell Seren's Minnesota assets to Charter Communications.  The sale of Seren in its entirety is expected to be completed in the second half of 2005. 
 
Note 6.  Corporate-Owned Life Insurance
 
 As previously disclosed in Note 3 to Xcel Energy's financial statements in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, in April 2004, Xcel Energy filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota against the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to establish its entitlement to deduct, for tax years 1993 and 1994, policy loan interest related to corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) policies on some current and former employees of PSCo.  These COLI policies are owned and managed by PSR Investments, Inc. (PSRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of PSCo.  In December 2004, Xcel Energy filed suit in U.S. Tax Court in Washington, D.C., for tax years 1995 through 1997 and again in March 2005 for tax years 1998 and 1999.  The IRS had challenged the deductibility of such interest expense deductions and has disallowed the deductions taken in tax years 1993 through 2001.
Tax Matters
 
Xcel Energy requested that the tax court consolidate and stay its petitions pending the decision in the district court litigation, and Xcel Energy brought a motion for summary judgment in the district court litigation.  Oral arguments on Xcel Energy's summary judgment motion were expected to be presented to the district court on June 17, 2005.  On June 14, 2005, the IRS filed its own motion for summary judgment, arguing that PSCo was not entitled to the COLI deductions because PSCo had no insurable interest in its employees' lives.  Xcel Energy denies that this claim has any merit.  A court hearing is scheduled for August 19, 2005 to hear both motions.
 
 In July 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) discussed potential changes or clarifications in the criteria for recognition of tax benefits, which may result in raising the threshold for recognizing tax benefits that have some degree of uncertainty.  On July 14, 2005, the FASB issued an exposure draft on accounting for uncertain tax positions under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109.  If adopted as proposed, the interpretation will be effective Dec. 31, 2005 and only tax benefits that meet the probable recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized on the effective date.
Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions
Initial derecognition amounts will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.  The exposure draft requires a 60-day comment period, which will be followed by deliberations.  Accordingly, if adopted as proposed, Xcel Energy would report as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in its 2005 income statement a charge of approximately $350 million relating to COLI tax benefits and additional interest costs.  Under the proposed interpretation penalties are to be accrued when a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold.  Xcel Energy believes the COLI position exceeds the minimum statutory threshold and, therefore, does not expect to accrue penalties under the interpretation.  However, if penalties were required to be accrued, they would be approximately $65 million.  Xcel Energy has not yet evaluated the impact the proposed interpretation would have on other existing income tax positions.
