Financial results for regulatory reporting frequently differ from GAAP.
Regulatory reporting includes the use of 12 and 13 month averages for capitalization, eliminates inter-company transactions, excludes non-regulated investments, includes or excludes revenues and or expenses associated with various recovery mechanisms and other factors, all of which may vary from one regulatory jurisdiction to another.
