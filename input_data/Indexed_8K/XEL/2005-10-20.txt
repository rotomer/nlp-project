As reported in Xcel Energy Inc.'s (the Company's) Form 8-K filed on September 14, 2005, on September 9, 2005, the Company's board of directors elected Richard H. Truly, 67, to fill a vacancy on the board of directors for a term expiring at the Company's 2006 annual meeting of shareholders or until his successor is elected and duly qualified.  At that time, he was not named to any committees of the board of directors.  On October 19, 2005, the board of directors appointed Mr. Truly to serve on its Finance Committee and its Operations, Nuclear and Environmental Committee.  Also on October 19, 2005, the board of directors granted Mr. Truly a pro-rated portion of the stock equivalent units awarded annually to non-employee members of the board of directors under the Stock Equivalent Plan for Non-Employee Directors.  Mr. Truly was granted stock equivalent units valued at approximately $37,100, representing the pro-rated portion of the award for service from September 9, 2005 until the Company's annual meeting of shareholders in 2006.
 
On October 19, 2005, Mr. Ralph R. Peterson, 61, a member of the Company's board of directors since May 2004, announced his resignation from the board.  Mr. Peterson is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CH2M Hill Companies, Ltd.  From time to time, subsidiaries of the Company have engaged CH2M Hill Companies, Ltd. and its subsidiaries to provide limited engineering and construction technical services.  At all times during his tenure as a director of the Company, however, Mr. Peterson was an independent director, according to the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, as well as the Company's Guidelines on Corporate Governance.
 
It is expected that subsidiaries of the Company will engage CH2M Hill Companies, Ltd. or its subsidiaries to provide more significant services.  Mr. Peterson resigned from the board to eliminate any actual and/or perceived conflicts between the interests of CH2M Hill Companies, Ltd. or its subsidiaries and the interests of the Company or its subsidiaries. Mr. Peterson also resigned to avoid the possibility that he would no longer qualify as an independent director of the Company.  Mr. Peterson's resignation was effective upon acceptance, which occurred on October 19, 2005.
