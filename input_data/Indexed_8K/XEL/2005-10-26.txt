Exhibit 99.01
 
 
 
October 26, 2005
 
 
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS  Xcel Energy Inc. (NYSE: XEL) announced income from continuing operations of $198 million, or 47 cents per share on a diluted basis, for the third quarter of 2005, compared with $166 million, or 40 cents per share, in the third quarter of 2004.
 
Total earnings for the quarter, which include the impact of discontinued operations, were $196 million, or 47 cents per share, in 2005, compared with $47 million, or 12 cents per share, in 2004.
 
Xcel Energy's total earnings for the third quarter of 2005 included the following:
 - 
                 
Regulated utility earnings from continuing operations were $194 million, or 46 cents per share, compared with $174 million, or 41 cents per share, in 2004;
 - 
                 
Nonregulated subsidiary and holding company income from continuing operations was $6 million, or 1 cent per share, compared with a loss of $5 million, or 1 cent per share in 2004; and
 - 
                 
Results from discontinued operations were a loss of $2 million, or less than 1 cent per share, compared with losses of $119 million, or 28 cents per share, in 2004.  The loss in 2004 includes an after-tax impairment charge of $112 million, or 27 cents per share, related to Seren Innovations, Inc.
 
Regulated utility earnings for the third quarter of 2005 increased primarily due to higher electric margins resulting from warmer weather in 2005 compared with cooler weather in 2004, a lower effective tax rate and sales growth, particularly in the northern regions.  Partially offsetting these positive factors were higher operating and maintenance expense and higher depreciation expense resulting from major plant and software additions completed in 2004 and early 2005.
 
"Throughout the year, we have initiated activities that will begin to contribute to earnings in 2006 and beyond," said Ben Fowke, vice president and chief financial officer.  "While we are pleased with the company's third quarter results, we currently expect our fourth quarter financial performance to be somewhat lower than previously anticipated and 2005 earnings from continuing operations to be within the lower half of our $1.18 to $1.28 per share guidance range.  Today we are initiating 2006 earnings guidance of $1.25 to $1.35 per share," Fowke said.
At 9 a.m. CDT today, Xcel Energy will host a conference call to review third quarter financial results.  To participate in the conference call, please dial in five to 10 minutes prior to the scheduled start and follow the operator's instructions.
 
 
The conference call also will be simultaneously broadcast and archived on Xcel Energy's Web site at www.xcelenergy.com.  To access the presentation, click on Investor Information.

Notes to Investor Relations Release (Unaudited)
 
Due to the seasonality of Xcel Energy's operating results, quarterly financial results are not an appropriate base from which to project annual results.
 
Note 1.  Earnings per Share Summary
 
The following table summarizes the earnings-per-share contributions of Xcel Energy's businesses.
 
 
The loss from discontinued operations in 2004 includes an after-tax impairment charge of $112 million, or 27 cents per share, related to Seren Innovations, Inc.  Seren assets are expected to be sold to two parties with anticipated completion dates in late 2005 and early 2006.
 
The following table summarizes significant components contributing to the changes in the third quarter and year-to-date 2005 earnings per share compared with the same periods in 2004, which are discussed in more detail later in the release.
 
 
Note 2.  Regulated Utility Segment Results  Continuing Operations
 
The following summarizes the estimated impact of temperature variations on utility results included in continuing operations, compared with sales under normal weather conditions.
Estimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings
 
 The following table summarizes Xcel Energy's regulated utility growth from continuing operations for actual and weather-normalized energy sales for the three- and nine-month periods ended Sept. 30, 2005, compared with the same period in 2004.
Sales Growth
 
 
Due to the low volume of natural gas sales for the third quarter, the weather-normalized sales growth is not a meaningful measure.
*
                
 
The following table details the revenue and margin for base electric utility, short-term wholesale and commodity trading activities that are included in continuing operations:
Base Electric Utility, Short-term Wholesale and
Commodity Trading Margins
 
 
Note  The short-term wholesale and commodity trading results in the above table reflect the estimated impacts of the regulatory sharing of certain margins.
 
Base electric utility margins, which are primarily derived from retail customer sales, increased approximately $70 million for the third quarter of 2005, compared with the third quarter of 2004.  Base electric utility margins increased approximately $143 million for the first nine months of 2005, compared with the same period in 2004.  For more information see the following table:
Base Electric Utility Margin
 
 
Short-term wholesale margins consist of energy-related purchase and sales activity and the use of certain financial instruments associated with the fuel required for and energy produced from Xcel Energy's generation assets and energy and capacity purchased to serve native load.  Commodity trading margins are not associated with Xcel Energy's generation assets or the capacity and energy purchased to serve native load.
 
Short-term wholesale and commodity trading margins decreased approximately $12 million and $36 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2005, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2004.  The higher 2004 short-term wholesale results reflect the impact of more favorable market conditions and higher levels of surplus generation available to sell.  In addition, a preexisting contract contributed $17 million in the first quarter of 2004 and expired at that time.
 
 Other operating and maintenance expenses for the third quarter of 2005 increased by approximately $22 million, or 5.8 percent, compared with the same period in 2004.  The increase is primarily due to higher employee benefit costs of approximately $10 million compared with 2004. The higher employee benefit costs are primarily associated with increased pension expense.  In addition, the increase reflects the unfavorable impact of $8.5 million related to two accrued litigation adjustments recorded in 2005 and 2004, as well as $4.8 million related to a favorable inventory adjustment recorded in 2004.
Other Operating and Maintenance Expenses  Utility
 
Other operating and maintenance expenses for the first nine months of 2005 increased $76 million, or 6.5 percent, compared with the same period in 2004.   Two nuclear plant refueling, inspection and upgrade outages in 2005, with no comparable outages in the first nine months of 2004, increased costs by approximately $33 million.  In addition, employee benefit costs were approximately $20 million higher in 2005 than 2004, primarily due to increased performance-based compensation and pension benefits.  Also contributing to the increase was the unfavorable impact of $8.5 million related to two accrued litigation adjustments recorded in 2005 and 2004, as well as $4.8 million related to a favorable inventory adjustment in 2004.
 
Depreciation and Amortization
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately $13 million, or 7.5 percent, for the third quarter, and $56 million, or 10.8 percent, for the first nine months of 2005, compared with the same periods in 2004.  The changes were primarily due to the installation of new steam generators at the Prairie Island nuclear plant and software system additions during 2004 and early 2005, both of which have relatively short depreciable lives compared with other capital additions.  In addition, renewable development fund and renewable cost recovery amortization increased over 2004.  The increase was partially offset by the changes in lives and net salvage rates contained in two Northern States Power Co., a Minnesota corporation (NSP-Minnesota) depreciation filings approved by state regulators during August 2005.
 
 Income taxes for continuing operations decreased by $13 million for the third quarter of 2005, compared with the same period in 2004.  The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 23.5 percent for the third quarter of 2005, compared with 30.9 percent for the same period in 2004.  Income taxes for the third quarter
Income Taxes
of 2005 reflect tax benefits from increased research credits and a net operating loss carryback.  Income tax expense recorded in the third quarter of 2005 also reflects reductions to adjust to the forecasted annual effective tax rate.
 
Income taxes for continuing operations decreased by $32 million for the first nine months of 2005, compared with the same period in 2004.  The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 24.6 percent for the first nine months of 2005, compared with 28.9 percent for the same period in 2004.  Income taxes recorded in 2005 reflect tax benefits from increased research credits and a net operating loss carryback.
 
Note 3.  Xcel Energy Capital Structure
 
The following is the preliminary capital structure of Xcel Energy at September 30, 2005:
 
 
On July 21, 2005, NSP-Minnesota, issued $250 million of first mortgage bonds.  The bonds mature in 2035 and have a coupon interest rate of 5.25 percent.  NSP-Minnesota intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the first mortgage bonds to repay borrowings under its credit facility and approximately $75 million of debt maturing during 2005.
 
On Aug. 18, 2005, Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo) issued  $129.5 million of 4.375 percent pollution control refunding revenue bonds due September 2017.  The proceeds were used to repay prior to maturity $79.5 million of outstanding Adams County Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds, 1993 Series A and $50 million of Morgan County Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds, 1993 Series A.
 
Note 4.  Rates and Regulation
 
- In September 2004, NSP-Minnesota filed a natural gas rate case for its Minnesota retail customers, seeking a rate increase of $9.9 million, based on a return on equity of 11.5 percent.  In August 2005, the MPUC approved an annual rate increase of $5.8 million, based on a return on equity of 10.4 percent.
NSP-Minnesota Natural Gas Rate Case
 
NSP-Wisconsin 2006 General Rate Case
-
Northern States Power Company, a Wisconsin corporation (NSP-Wisconsin), filed with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) an electric and natural gas rate case, as amended on Sept. 28, 2005, to reflect higher energy costs. The amended filing requested an electric revenue increase of $53.1 million, or 13.4 percent, and a natural gas revenue increase of $7.7 million, or 4.8 percent, based on an 11.9 percent return on equity and a 56.32 percent common equity to total capitalization ratio.
 
On Oct. 12, 2005, the staff of the PSCW filed testimony recommending that NSP-Wisconsin has a 2006 test year electric revenue deficiency of $45.4 million, or 11.4 percent, and a natural gas revenue deficiency of $5.8 million, or 3.5 percent, based on an 11.0 percent return on equity and a 56.43 percent common equity to total capitalization ratio.
Intervenor testimony was also filed on Oct. 12, 2005.  Consultants representing the industrial intervenor group advocated a return on equity of 10.5 percent and a common equity to total capitalization ratio of 51 percent, as well as modifications to NSP-Wisconsin's class cost of service study and rate design that would benefit their clients.  Testimony submitted on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense and other federal executive agencies advocated a 10.25 percent return on equity and a common equity to total capitalization ratio of 56.3 percent, as well as cost allocations and rate design to benefit the Fort McCoy military installation.
 
Both the staff of the PSCW and the industrial intervenor group suggested that the PSCW consider whether it should continue to authorize a common equity to total capitalization ratio and return on equity comparable to other A or AA rated Wisconsin utilities or use metrics appropriate to a BBB+ credit rating.
 
Hearings are scheduled to begin on Nov. 1, 2005, with a decision expected near the end of 2005.
 
PSCo Natural Gas Rate Case
 On May 27, 2005, PSCo filed for an increase of natural gas base rates in Colorado.  PSCo's filing, amended in July 2005, requests an increase in annual revenues of approximately $34.5 million, or 3 percent annually.  The filing asks for a return on equity of 11.00 percent with a capital structure consisting of 55.49 percent equity and 44.51 percent debt resulting in an overall return on rate base of 9.01 percent applied to year end rate base.
 
On Oct. 5, 2005, intervenors began filing testimony regarding the PSCo gas rate case.  In its testimony, the staff of the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) recommended an increase in annual revenues of approximately $9 million, a return on equity of 9.5 percent and a capital structure consisting of 52.53 percent equity and 47.47 percent debt, resulting in an overall return on rate base of 8.11 percent applied to average rate base.
 
The Office of Consumer Counsel also proposed a decrease in annual revenues of $189,000, a return on equity of 8.5 percent and a capital structure consisting of 50.11 percent equity and 49.89 percent debt, resulting in an overall return on rate base of 7.56 percent applied to average rate base.
 
Several other parties filed testimony with their proposals to the CPUC.  It is anticipated that a decision by the CPUC would become effective early in 2006.
 
Note 5.  Corporate-Owned Life Insurance
 
 As previously disclosed in Note 3 to Xcel Energy's financial statements in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, in April 2004, Xcel Energy filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota against the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to establish its entitlement to deduct, for tax years 1993 and 1994, policy loan interest related to corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) policies on some current and former employees of PSCo.  These COLI policies are owned and managed by PSR Investments, Inc. (PSRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of PSCo.  In December 2004, Xcel Energy filed suit in U.S. Tax Court in Washington, D.C., for tax years 1995 through 1997 and again in March 2005 for tax years 1998 and 1999.  The IRS had challenged the deductibility of such interest expense deductions and has disallowed the deductions taken in tax years 1993 through 2001.
Tax Matters
 
On May 2, 2005, Xcel Energy filed a motion for summary judgment in the district court litigation, which summary judgment motion asserted that Xcel Energy is entitled, as a matter of law, to deduct the policy loan interest.  On June 22, 2005, the government also filed a summary judgment motion arguing that Xcel Energy lacked an insurable interest in the lives of its employees, and therefore, the policies were allegedly void.  Both motions were heard in district court on Aug. 19, 2005.
 
On Oct. 12, 2005, because there were material issues of fact still in dispute, the district court denied Xcel Energy's motion for summary judgment, which asserted that Xcel Energy is entitled, as a matter of law, to deduct the policy loan interest.  It also denied the government's motion for summary judgment, which asserted that Xcel Energy had no insurable interest in the lives of its employees.  The district court did grant partial summary judgment to Xcel
Energy affirming that it had an insurable interest in the lives of its employees.  The case is expected to proceed to trial, and the litigation could require several years to reach final resolution, if the trial court decision is appealed.
 On July 14, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an exposure draft on accounting for uncertain tax positions under SFAS No. 109.  As issued, the exposure draft would have been effective Dec. 31, 2005, and only tax benefits that meet the probable recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized on the effective date.  Initial derecognition amounts will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions
 
Accordingly, as proposed under the exposure draft, Xcel Energy would report as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in its income statement for the year ended Dec. 31, 2005, a charge of approximately $350 million relating to COLI tax benefits and additional interest costs.  Under the exposure draft, penalties are to be accrued when a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold.  Xcel Energy believes the COLI position exceeds the minimum statutory threshold and, therefore, does not expect to accrue penalties under the interpretation.  However, if penalties were required to be accrued, they would be approximately $65 million.  Xcel Energy has not yet evaluated the impact the proposed interpretation would have on other existing income tax positions.  The FASB has announced that the effective date of the new rules will be delayed, with a revised pronouncement to be released no earlier than the first quarter of 2006.
 
Note 6.  Capital Expenditure Forecast Update
 
The following is the consolidated Xcel Energy capital expenditure forecast:
 
 
*Minnesota emissions reduction project
 
The following is an update of the capital expenditure forecast for each of the utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy:
 
 
The capital expenditure programs of Xcel Energy are subject to continuing review and modification.  Actual utility construction expenditures may vary from the estimates due to changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth, the desired reserve margin and the availability of purchased power, as well as alternative plans for meeting Xcel Energy's long-term energy needs.  In addition, Xcel Energy's ongoing evaluation of compliance with future requirements to install emission-control equipment, and merger, acquisition and divestiture opportunities to support corporate strategies may impact actual capital requirements.
