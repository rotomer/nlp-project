Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On Dec. 13 and 14, 2005, the Governance, Compensation & Nominating Committee (the Committee) of the Xcel Energy Inc. board of directors took actions setting executives' salaries, annual bonus targets and long-term compensation targets for 2006.  Executive compensation was set by the Committee after consideration of, among other things, individual performance and market-based data on compensation for executives with similar duties.  Payouts of 2006 annual bonus targets and long-term awards are dependent on achievement of specified goals set by the Committee, and no officer is assured of any payout.  Set forth below is a description of the actions taken.
Salary
The Committee established the base salaries of its senior executive group for 2006.  The salary of Mr. Richard Kelly, the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer increased 14 percent in recognition of his assumption of additional duties as newly-elected Chairman of the Board.  The salary increases for the other Xcel Energy officers who are expected to be named in the Summary Compensation Table in Xcel Energy's 2006 Proxy Statement (the Named Executive Officers) ranged from 0 percent to 14 percent.
 
Annual Bonus Targets
Annual incentive awards, expressed as a percentage of salary, were set by the Committee under the Xcel Energy Executive Annual Incentive Award Plan (effective May 25, 2005) (the Xcel Energy Annual Incentive Plan), which was approved by Xcel Energy's shareholders in 2005.  Payouts of annual incentive awards are dependent on the level of achievement of corporate financial and operational goals and business unit operational goals approved by the Committee, with each individual having the opportunity to earn from 0 percent to 200 percent of his or her target annual incentive award based on the level of achievement in 2006 of the goals applicable to such individual.
Corporate goals for 2006 include targeted earnings per share, a customer service measurement, an environmental measurement, operations measurements related to generation availability, system reliability and safety, and an employee engagement measurement.  Business unit goals
are related to customer service, environmental responsibility, reliability, safety and management to budgeted financial results, measured at a business unit level.
Target annual incentive awards, as a percent of base salary, were set for all Xcel Energy officers, ranging from 100 percent of salary for Mr. Kelly to 55 percent to 65 percent of salary for the other Named Executive Officers.  With the approval of the Committee, an award may be multiplied by a leadership-rating from zero to two.
Payout of the annual incentive award for Mr. Kelly is dependent entirely on attaining corporate goals.  For the other executive officers, including Named Executive Officers, the formula is weighted 67 percent to attaining corporate goals and 33 percent to attaining business unit operational goals.
In order to encourage increased share ownership by executive officers, the Xcel Energy Annual Incentive Plan provides the option for executives to receive their payments in shares of common stock or shares of restricted common stock, which vests in equal annual installments over a three-year period, in lieu of cash.  A 5 percent premium is added to amounts paid in shares of common stock, and a 20 percent premium is added to amounts paid in shares of restricted common stock.  The terms of the annual incentive awards are subject to the Xcel Energy Annual Incentive Plan that is filed as Appendix C to Xcel Energy's 2005 Proxy Statement.
Long-Term Awards
The Committee also approved target long-term incentive grants, effective Jan. 1, 2006, pursuant to the Xcel Energy 2005 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which was approved by shareholders in 2005.  As explained below, payout of long-term incentive grants is dependent on achievement of performance goals set by the Committee.  Long-term incentive grants were made 50 percent in the form of performance-based restricted stock units and 50 percent in the form of performance shares.  The amounts of the awards for each individual were established by the Committee and expressed as a percentage of such individual's base salary.  The actual number of performance-based restricted stock units and performance shares awarded to an individual will be determined by dividing the dollar value of such percentage of base salary by the expected value of each award type as determined on Jan. 2, 2006.  For Mr. Kelly, his target long-term award for 2006 was set at 260 percent of his salary.  For the other Named Executive Officers, the percentage ranged from 110 percent to 135 percent.
Performance-based restricted stock units ("Units") will represent an equal number of shares of Xcel Energy common stock.  Prior to the expiration of the restricted period, the Units may not be sold or otherwise transferred by the recipients.  Units will be credited during the restricted period at the same rate as dividends paid on all other shares of outstanding common stock.  The dividend equivalents will be subject to all terms of the original grant.
Payout of the Units and the lapsing of restrictions on the transfer of Units will be based on two separate performance criteria.  Seventy-five percent of awarded Units plus associated earned dividend equivalents will be settled, and the restricted period will lapse, after Xcel Energy achieves a specified earnings per share (EPS) growth (adjusted for corporate-owned life insurance) measured against Dec. 31, 2005 EPS (adjusted for corporate-owned life insurance). 
Additionally, Xcel Energy's annual dividend paid on its common stock must remain at $0.86 per share or greater.  EPS growth will be measured annually at the end of each fiscal year.  However, in no event will the restrictions lapse prior to Dec. 31, 2007.  If the performance criteria have not been met within four years of the date of grant, all associated Units will be forfeited.
The remaining 25 percent of awarded Units plus associated earned dividend equivalents will be settled, and the restricted period will lapse, after the average of actual performance results for the three components of an environmental index (measured as a percent of target performance) meets or exceeds 100 percent.  The environmental index will be measured annually at the end of each fiscal year.  However, in no event will the restrictions lapse prior to Dec. 31, 2007.  If the performance criteria have not been met within four years of the date of grant, all associated Units will be forfeited.
The separate awards of performance shares also will represent an equal number of shares of Xcel Energy common stock.  Performance shares may not be sold or otherwise transferred.  Payout of the performance share award will be dependent entirely on a single measure, total shareholder return (TSR).  Xcel Energy's TSR will be measured over a three-year period.  Xcel Energy's TSR will be compared to the TSR of other companies in the Edison Electric Institute's Electrics Index as a peer group.  At the end of the three-year period, potential payouts of the performance shares will range from 0 percent to 200 percent, depending on Xcel Energy's TSR compared to the peer group.
The terms of the foregoing grants are consistent with the 2005 Omnibus Incentive Plan and terms of award agreements filed as Appendix B to Xcel Energy's 2005 Proxy Statement and Exhibits 10.04, 10.05 and 10.07 to Xcel Energy's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2005.
The following table shows the value of performance-based restricted stock units and performance shares granted, effective Jan. 1, 2006, to Named Executive Officers, expressed as a percentage of salary:
Other Actions
The Board elected Richard C. Kelly Chairman of the Board to replace Wayne H. Brunetti who, as previously reported, retired effective Dec. 15, 2005.
On Dec. 14, 2005, the Xcel Energy board of directors amended the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, in part to comply with deferred compensation requirements of Section 885 of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  Among other things, the amendments clarified the Plan's benefit formula and limited the timing and forms of payments, including the ability to elect optional forms, to comply with the new deferred compensation requirements.  The Plan, as amended is filed as Exhibit 10.01 hereto.
Also, effective Jan. 1, 2006, two additional executive officers, Benjamin G.S. Fowke III, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Raymond E. Gogel, Vice President and Chief Information Officer, were designated as participants in the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, from August 21, 2000 (date of creation of Xcel Energy Inc.) until the Restatement Effective Date, Vesting Service was measured in years and completed months as a Participant for the time such Participant was an "officer" of the Company, and not for the time the Participant was in the service in a capacity as something other than as an "officer" of the Company.

Service or earnings after the date the individual ceases to be a Participant shall be disregarded for purposes of this Plan, but the individual shall remain entitled to any benefits under this Plan that have become vested prior to that date.
Sec. 3.2
.

interfere with any rights the Participating Employers would have in the absence of such participation to determine the duration of the employee's employment with the Participating Employers.
 
  Subject to the provisions of Sections 4.2 and 4.3 below, the Normal Retirement Benefit under this Plan of a Participant who is vested under Sec. 4.3 shall be a monthly amount, calculated in the form of a 240-month certain annuity with a 50% survivor benefit feature, equal to the amount determined in subsection (a), less the amounts determined in subsections (b), (c), (d) and (e)(but shall not be an amount less than zero):
Sec. 4.1
.
                  
Amount of Normal Retirement Benefit
 
One-twelfth of 55% of the Participant's Final Average Compensation multiplied by the Participant's Accrual Percentage.
(a)
                                 
 
The monthly basic pension amount to which the Participant is entitled to receive under the Retirement Plan in the form of a life-only annuity commencing on the first day of the month following the later of (i) the Participant's normal retirement age under the Retirement Plan, or (ii) the date the Participant's retirement or other separation from service with the Participating Employers occurs.  This amount shall be determined without regard to the actual benefit paid under the Retirement Plan (and shall not include or take into account the Retirement Plan's "Retirement Spending Account", "Social Security Supplement" or any other ancillary or supplemental benefit) or the actual distribution time or optional form of benefit elected.  If the Participant's benefit is in the form of the "Cash Balance" feature under the Retirement Plan, and the Participant had elected to have all or part of the Participant's "Retirement Program Credits" contributed to the Xcel Energy Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan, or any predecessor or successor to such plan, then the monthly pension determined under this subsection (b) shall be increased to reflect the amount to which the Participant would have been entitled under the Retirement Plan if such credits had instead been allocated to the Retirement Plan.
(b)
                                
 
The monthly basic pension amount to which the Participant is entitled to receive under the Xcel Energy Inc. Nonqualified Pension Plan, due to Compensation exceeding the limits outlined by Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") Section 401(a)(17), commencing on the first day of the month following the later of (i) the Participant's normal retirement age under the Retirement Plan, or (ii) the date the Participant's retirement or other separation from service with the Participating Employers occurs.  This amount shall be determined without regard to the actual benefit paid under the Retirement Plan or the actual distribution time or optional form of benefit elected.
(c)
                                 
 
The monthly basic pension amount to which the Participant is entitled to receive under the Xcel Energy Excess Benefit Plan, due to benefits exceeding the limits outlined by IRC Section 415, commencing on the first day of the month following the later of (i) the Participant's normal retirement age under the Retirement Plan, or (ii) the date the Participant's retirement or other separation from service with the Participating Employers occurs.  This amount shall be determined without regard to the actual benefit paid under the Retirement Plan or Excess Benefit Plan or the actual distribution time or optional form of benefit elected.
(d)
                                
The Actuarial Equivalent monthly benefit of the amount determined under Section 9(E) of the NSP Deferred Compensation Plan (Restated and Amended Through January 1, 1992) (the "grandfathered incentive plan"), or any successor plan, commencing on the first day of the month following the later of (i) the Participant's normal retirement age under the Retirement Plan, or (ii) the date the Participant's retirement or other separation from service with the Participating Employers occurs.  This amount shall be determined without regard to the actual benefit paid under the Retirement Plan or the grandfathered incentive plan or the actual distribution time or optional form of benefit elected
(e)
                                 
 
  For Participants who participated in the PSCo SERP or the SPS SERP on the day before the Effective Date, the Normal Retirement Benefit under Sec. 4.1 shall not be less than the Actuarial Equivalent (expressed in the form payable under Sec. 4.1) the accrued benefit determined under the PSCo SERP or the SPS SERP (whichever covered the Participant on the Effective Date), determined by assuming that the Participant separated from service on May 1, 2000.  However, whether the Participant is vested in such benefit shall be determined pursuant to Sec. 4.3 of this Plan as of the date the Participant's actual separation from service occurs.
Sec. 4.2

Special Provisions for PSCo and SPS SERP Participation
 
  A Participant's Normal Retirement Benefit shall become vested upon the earlier of:
Sec. 4.3
.
                  
Vesting of Benefit
 
The Participant's completion of five (5) Years of Vesting Service.
(a)
                                 
 
The Participant's attainment of age 60.
(b)
                                
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant shall not be vested in any benefit under this Plan and the entire benefit shall be forfeited if the Participant's employment is terminated by his or her Participating Employer because of the Participant's fraud or dishonesty which has resulted in, or is likely to result in, material economic damage to a Participating Employer, as determined in good faith by the Committee.  The determination of the Committee with respect to the Participant's conduct shall be conclusive, whether or not there are related judicial or other proceedings and without regard to the outcome of any such proceeding.  A Participant who is not vested under this Section on the date his or her retirement or other separation from service occurs, shall not be eligible to receive any benefit under this Plan.
 
  In the event of the Participant's retirement or other separation from service (except for death or disability) with the Participating Employers and all Affiliates therein on or after attaining age 62, payment of the Participant's vested Normal Retirement Benefit shall commence as of the first day of the seventh month following the date on which such retirement or other separation from service occurs, and will be paid, except as provided in Section 5.2, in a lump sum. This lump sum value will be the Actuarial Equivalent of the 240-month certain annuity, with a 50% survivor benefit as determined in Section 4.1. The Actuarial Equivalent lump sum shall be based on the applicable interest and mortality rates in effect at commencement of the benefit under this Plan.
Sec. 5.1
.
                  
Normal Form
 
Payment as an Actuarial Equivalent optional form of benefit to the lump sum payable under Section 5.1 may be elected by the Participant.
Sec. 5.2
.
                  
Optional Forms
An optional form of distribution payable on or after January 1, 2005 must have been elected by the Participant at or prior to the time the Participant became a Participant under the Plan (or, if later, January 1, 2005, and is irrevocable). An Actuarial Equivalent life-only annuity and a joint and 50% survivor annuity are the optional benefit forms available. For this purpose, a joint and 50% survivor annuity shall mean an annuity payable for the lifetime of the Participant and continuing thereafter for the lifetime of a contingent annuitant named by the Participant, if surviving at the Participant's death, in a monthly amount equal to 50% of the amount that had been payable to the Participant.
