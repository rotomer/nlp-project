Item 8.01. Other Events
 
On March 2, 2006, interveners filed testimony regarding the Minnesota electric rate case of Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota corporation, (NSP-Minnesota), which was filed with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) on Nov. 2, 2005. NSP-Minnesota is a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy. NSP-Minnesota's filing requests an increase in annual revenues of approximately $168 million or 8 percent. The filing asks for a return on equity of 11.00 percent with an equity ratio of 51.37 percent and an overall return on rate base of 9.04 percent applied to a 2006 forecasted rate base.
 
In its testimony, the Minnesota Department of Commerce counter-proposed an increase in annual revenues of approximately $78 million, a return on equity of 10.54 percent and a proposed capital structure of 51.37 percent resulting in an overall return on rate base of 8.81 percent. The primary adjustments related to return on equity; decommissioning expense; adjustments to fuel expense and an increase in sales volumes. On the latter two issues the Department of Commerce indicated that the recommendations may change if NSP-Minnesota is able to supply additional information in its rebuttal testimony.
 
The Office of Attorney General also filed testimony. It proposed two adjustments related to income taxes and wholesale margins that would result in a decrease in current annual revenues of approximately $20 million.
 
Several other parties filed testimony with their proposals to the MPUC. The testimony can be viewed by going to Xcel Energy's web site at www.xcelenergy.com/XLWEB/CDA/0,3080,1-1-1_1875_1802_3576-25058-0_0_0-0,00.html.
