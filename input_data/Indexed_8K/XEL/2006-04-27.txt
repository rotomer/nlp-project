MINNEAPOLIS  Xcel Energy Inc. (NYSE: XEL) announced income from continuing operations of $150 million, or 36 cents per share on a diluted basis, for the first quarter of 2006 compared with $124 million, or 30 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2005.
 
Total earnings for the quarter, which include the impact of discontinued operations, were $151 million, or 36 cents per share, in 2006, compared with $121 million, or 29 cents per share, in 2005.
 
Xcel Energy's total earnings for the first quarter of 2006 included the following:
 - 
                 
Regulated utility earnings from continuing operations were $162 million, or 38 cents per share, compared to $135 million, or 32 cents per share, in 2005;
 - 
                 
Holding company and other costs from continuing operations were $12 million, or 2 cents per share, compared to costs of $10 million, or 2 cents per share in 2005; and
 - 
                 
Results from discontinued operations were $1.5 million, or 0 cents per share, compared with losses of $3.0 million, or 1 cent per share, in 2005.
 
Earnings for the first quarter of 2006 increased primarily due to stronger utility margins, partially offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses. The stronger utility margins reflect a natural gas rate increase in Colorado, an electric and natural gas rate increase in Wisconsin and an interim electric rate increase in Minnesota. Warmer than normal weather during the first quarter partially offset these positive developments.
 
We are pleased with the progress toward achieving our earnings growth objective," said Richard C. Kelly, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We are reaffirming our 2006 earnings guidance of $1.25 to $1.35 per share."
At 9 a.m. CDT today, Xcel Energy will host a conference call to review first quarter financial results. To participate in the conference call, please dial in five to 10 minutes prior to the scheduled start and follow the operator's instructions.
 
 
The conference call also will be simultaneously broadcast and archived on Xcel Energy's Web site at www.xcelenergy.com. To access the presentation, click on Investor Information.

Notes to Investor Relations Release (Unaudited)
 
Due to the seasonality of Xcel Energy's operating results, quarterly financial results are not an appropriate base from which to project annual results.
 
Certain items in the statements of operations have been reclassified from prior period presentation to conform to the 2006 presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net income or total earnings per share. The reclassifications were primarily related to the presentation of Quixx Corp. as discontinued operations in August 2005. In addition, fees collected from customers on behalf of governmental agencies were reclassified to be presented net of the related payments made to the agencies.
 
Note 1. Earnings per Share Summary
 
The following table summarizes the earnings-per-share contributions of Xcel Energy's businesses.
 
 
The following table summarizes significant components contributing to the changes in the first quarter of 2006 earnings per share compared with the same period in 2005, which are discussed in more detail later in the release.
 
Note 2. Regulated Utility Segment Results  Continuing Operations
 
The following summarizes the estimated impact of temperature variations on utility results included in continuing operations, compared with sales under normal weather conditions.
Estimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings
 
 
 The following table summarizes Xcel Energy's regulated utility growth from continuing operations for actual and weather-normalized energy sales for the three-month period ended March 31, 2006, compared with the same period in 2005.
Sales Growth
 
 
The following table details the revenue and margin for base electric utility, short-term wholesale and commodity trading activities that are included in continuing operations:
Base Electric Utility, Short-term Wholesale and
Commodity Trading Margins
 
 
Note  The short-term wholesale and commodity trading results in the above table reflect the estimated impacts of the regulatory sharing of certain realized margins.
 
Base electric utility margins, which are primarily derived from retail customer sales, increased approximately $67 million for the first quarter of 2006, compared with the first quarter of 2005. The increase was primarily due to an interim rate increase in Minnesota, subject to refund, and weather-adjusted retail sales growth. For more information see the following table:
Base Electric Utility Margin
 
 
On Jan. 31, 2006, an interim rate increase for NSP-Minnesota of $147 million, subject to refund, in Minnesota went into effect. In March 2006, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) approved a new depreciation order, which lowered decommissioning accruals for 2006 from anticipated levels. As a result, interim rates are being recorded at an annual level of approximately $119 million. Due to the seasonality of sales, the rate increase will not be recognized ratably throughout 2006.
 
Short-term wholesale margins consist of energy-related purchase and sales activity and the use of certain financial instruments associated with the fuel required for and energy produced from Xcel Energy's generation assets and energy and capacity purchased to serve native load. Commodity trading margins are not associated with Xcel Energy's generation assets or the capacity and energy purchased to serve native load.
 
Short-term wholesale and commodity trading margins increased approximately $10 million during the first quarter of 2006. The increase is primarily due to strong commodity trading results, driven by market price movements.
 
-The following table details the changes in natural gas utility revenue and margin. The cost of natural gas tends to vary with changing sales requirements and the unit cost of natural gas purchases. However, due to purchased natural gas cost recovery mechanisms for sales to retail customers, fluctuations in the cost of natural gas have little effect on natural gas margin.
Natural Gas Utility Margins
 
The following summarizes the components of the changes in natural gas margin for the three months ended March 31:
 
Natural Gas Margin
 
 
 Other operating and maintenance expenses for the first quarter of 2006 increased by approximately $33 million, or 8.1 percent, compared with the same period in 2005. The increase is primarily due to increased uncollectible receivable and employee benefit costs, partially offset by lower nuclear plant maintenance costs due to the refueling and ten-year inspection outage at Monticello in 2005, with no comparable outage in 2006. For more information see the following table:
Other Operating and Maintenance Expenses  Utility
 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately $11 million, or 5.7 percent, for the first quarter of 2006, when compared with the first quarter of 2005. This change was primarily due to capital additions and increased decommissioning expense resulting from the completion of the transfer of nuclear decommissioning funds to a fully external decommissioning fund pursuant to certain previous regulatory orders.
Depreciation and Amortization
 
 Income taxes for continuing operations increased by $8 million for the first quarter of 2006 compared with the same period in 2005. The increase is primarily due to an increase in pretax income. The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 26.3 percent for the first quarter of 2006, compared with 26.5 percent for the same period in 2005.

Following is the preliminary capital structure of Xcel Energy at March 31, 2006:
 
 
Note 4. Rates and Regulation
 
In November 2005, NSP-Minnesota requested an electric rate increase in Minnesota of $168 million or 8.05 percent. This increase was based on a requested 11 percent return on common equity, a projected equity ratio of 51.7 percent and a projected electric rate base of $3.2 billion. An interim rate increase of $147 million was effective Jan. 1, 2006, subject to refund. In March 2006, in response to intervenor testimony, NSP Minnesota filed rebuttal testimony, which revised the requested increase to $156 million, largely due to revised decommissioning accruals.
NSP-Minnesota Electric Rate Case 
 
Through the first quarter, $25 million of interim rates in Minnesota have been recorded, which are subject to refund pending a final order from the MPUC.
 
The anticipated procedural schedule for the Minnesota electric rate case is noted below. An order from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission is expected in the fall of 2006.

On April 24, 2006, NSP-Minnesota reached a settlement agreement regarding the treatment of wholesale electric sales margins. The settlement is with five intervenor groups, including the Office of Attorney General and a large industrial customer group.
 
The settlement resolves recommendations of most parties regarding the treatment of wholesale electric sales margins. Significant components of the settlement agreement are as follows:
 
      No credit to base electric rates for wholesale electric sales margins;
 - 
      Wholesale electric sales margins derived from excess generation capacity will be flowed through the fuel clause adjustment as an offset to fuel and energy costs;
 - 
      80 percent of wholesale margins derived from the sales from NSP-Minnesota's ancillary services obligations (e.g. spinning reserves) will be flowed through the fuel clause adjustment as an offset to fuel and energy costs and NSP-Minnesota will retain 20 percent.
 - 
      25 percent of proprietary margins, sales that do not arise from the use of NSP-Minnesota generating assets, will be flowed through the fuel clause adjustment as an offset to fuel and energy costs, and 75 percent will be retained by NSP-Minnesota.
 - 
 
The settlement agreement is pending approval by the MPUC and will be considered in the MPUC's determination of NSP-Minnesota's overall requested increase.
 
Public Service Co. of Colorado (PSCo) Electric Rate Case 
On April 14, 2006, PSCo filed with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to increase electricity rates by $210 million annually, beginning Jan. 1, 2007. The rate request is based on a return on equity of 11 percent, an equity ratio of 59.9 percent and electric rate base of $3.4 billion. A decision is expected by the end of the year.
 
The general rate case filing reflects the increased costs of doing business since PSCo's last electric rate case was filed in 2001, including more than $1 billion of investment by PSCo in electricity generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure in Colorado. It also reflects the start of construction of a new, third unit at the Comanche Generating Station in Pueblo, Colo., which will help meet continued growing demand for electricity.
