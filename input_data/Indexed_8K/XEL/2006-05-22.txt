Corporate Owned Life Insurance Litigation (COLI)
 
The court's opinion in the Dow case outlined three indicators of potential economic benefits to be examined in a COLI case.
 
 - 
                 
Positive pre-deduction cash flows
 - 
                 
Mortality gains
 - 
                 
The buildup of cash values
 
In Xcel Energy's COLI case, the plans:
 
 - 
                 
Were projected to have sizeable pre-deduction cash flows, based upon the relevant assumptions when purchased
 - 
                 
Presented the opportunity for mortality gains that were not eliminated either retroactively or prospectively
 - 
                 
Had large cash value increases that were not encumbered by loans during the first seven years of the policies
