9.            
each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(b)          
It is understood and agreed that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties.  No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection.  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. 
(c)          
The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with such consent or if there be a judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify each indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. 
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Notes.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(d)          
The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and
(e)          
conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Companyand to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
(a)  If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Notes which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Notes on the terms contained herein.  If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Notes, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Notes on such terms.  In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Notes, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Notes, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary.  The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Notes.
10.          
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Notes of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Notes which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Notes, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Notes which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Notes which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Notes of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(b)          
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Notes of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Notes which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Notes, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Notes of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c)          
The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or
11.          
any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Notes.
If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Notes are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Notes, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
12.          
In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by you.
13.

Re:
$300,000,000 principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes, Series due July 1, 2036, of Xcel Energy Inc., a Minnesota corporation
                         
 
Gentlemen:
 
                For the purpose of rendering this opinion, I have examined the proceedings taken by Xcel Energy Inc., a Minnesota corporation, herein called the "Company," with respect to the issue and sale by the Company of $300,000,000 principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes, Series due July 1, 2036, herein called the "Notes."  In connection therewith I have participated in the preparation of the proceedings for the issuance and sale of the Notes including the Underwriting Agreement dated June 6, 2006 between you and the Company relating to your purchase of the Notes, herein called the "Agreement," and have either participated in the preparation of or examined the Indenture, dated as of December 1, 2000, as previously supplemented, and the Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 1, 2006 creating the Notes, all from the Company to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee (which Indenture, as so supplemented, and Supplemental Indenture are herein collectively called the "Indenture").  I also have participated in the preparation of or examined the registration statement and any amendments thereto and the accompanying prospectuses and any supplements thereto, as filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and any issuer free writing prospectuses, with respect to the Notes.   Whenever the terms "Registration Statement," "Preliminary Prospectus," "Prospectus" or "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus" are used herein, they shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Agreement and shall include, as provided in the Agreement, the documents incorporated by reference therein.  My examination has extended to all statutes, records, instruments, and documents which I have deemed necessary to examine for the purposes of this opinion.
 
I am of the opinion that:
 
1.             The Company has been duly incorporated and is a legally existing corporation under the laws of the State of Minnesota; has corporate power, right and authority to do business and to own or lease property in the states of Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Colorado in the manner and as set forth in the Prospectus; has corporate power, right and authority to own securities of its subsidiaries; is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation under the laws of the states of North Dakota, South Dakota and Colorado; and has corporate power, right and authority to make the Indenture and issue and sell the Notes;
 
2.             The authorized capital stock of the Company is as set forth in the most recent preliminary Prospectus and all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable;
3.             Each Significant Subsidiary, as defined in the Agreement, of the Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases substantial properties or in which the conduct of its business requires such qualification; all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each subsidiary has been duly authorized and validly issued and is fully paid and non-assessable; and the capital stock of each such subsidiary owned by the Company, directly or through subsidiaries, is owned free and clear of any pledge, lien, encumbrance, claim or equity;
 
4.             The Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid and binding obligation of the Company, except to the extent that the provisions for indemnities may be held to be unenforceable as against public policy;
 
5.             The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming that the Indenture is the valid and legally binding obligation of the Trustee, constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relative to or affecting creditors' rights or remedies according to general equity principles whether such principles are considered in law or in equity;
 
6.             The issuance of the Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the sale and delivery thereof pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement have been duly authorized by the Company; the statements made under the captions "Description of Senior Unsecured Debt Securities" and "Supplemental Description of Senior Notes" in the Prospectus, insofar as they purport to summarize provisions of documents specifically referred to therein, fairly present the information called for with respect thereto by Form S-3; the Notes have been duly authorized, executed and issued by the Company and, assuming due authentication thereof by the Trustee and upon payment and delivery in accordance with the Agreement, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable (subject to the qualifications expressed in paragraph 5 above with respect to the enforceability of the Indenture) against the Company in accordance with their terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture;
 
7.             The statements under the captions "Description of Senior Unsecured Debt Securities" and "Supplemental Description of the Senior Notes" in the Prospectus, insofar as they purport to summarize provisions of the documents specifically referred to therein, are accurate in all material respects;
 
8.             Neither the execution and the delivery of the Indenture or the Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby and the fulfillment of the terms thereof, the issuance and delivery of the Notes nor the compliance by the Company with all the terms and provisions of the Indenture and the Agreement will result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust or other agreement or instrument known to me to which the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is a party or in which the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries has a beneficial interest or by which it or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is bound or to which any of their respective properties or assets are subject, or the Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or by-laws of the
Company or any law, statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or, to the best of my knowledge, any order of any court or of any Federal or state regulatory body or administrative agency or other governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties;
 
9.             The Registration Statement has become effective under the Act; the most recent Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus (as defined in the Agreement) have been filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act, and the final term sheet has been filed pursuant to Rule 433 under the Act.  No proceedings for a stop order have been instituted or to my knowledge are pending or threatened under Section 8(d) of the Act; no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of such Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act has been received by the Company; the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"); and no further approval, authorization, consent, certificate or order of, or filing or registration with, any governmental body, federal, state or other, is required in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes by the Company as provided in the Agreement and the Prospectus, except as may be required by state securities laws;
 
10.           The Registration Statement, as of the Effective Date, and the Prospectus, as of its date, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and with the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and the documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus complied as to form when filed in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder, except that in each case no opinion is expressed with respect to the financial statements and supporting schedules included or incorporated by reference therein;
 
11.           To the best of my knowledge, there are no legal or governmental proceedings required to be described in the Prospectus which are not described as required nor any contracts or documents of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement which are not described and filed as required; and
 
12.           The Company's subsidiaries have all necessary power under statutory provisions, franchises (which expire at various dates), or permits to serve the customers in the jurisdictions where they provide electric and gas services, except in certain instances that are not material to the Company.
 
In the course of my participation in the preparation of the Registration Statement and Prospectus, I made investigations as to the accuracy of certain of the statements of fact contained therein, I discussed other matters with officers, employees, and representatives of the Company, and I examined various corporate records and data.  While I do not pass upon or assume responsibility for, and shall not be deemed to have independently verified, the accuracy and completeness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the most recent Preliminary Prospectus or the final term sheet (except as to matters set forth in paragraphs 6, 7, 11 and 12 above) nothing has come to my attention that would lead me to believe (i) that the Registration Statement, as of June 6, 2006, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading; (ii) that the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time (as defined in the Agreement), contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (iii) that the Prospectus, as of its date or as of the date hereof, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
 
In giving opinions as to conformity to the laws of States other than Minnesota, I have in certain instances relied upon the opinion of other counsel employed or retained by the Company to render opinions in respect thereto.
 
Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, as counsel to the Underwriters, may rely on this opinion letter in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.

1.             No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any governmental agency or body or any court is required in connection with the issuance or sale of the Notes by the Company to the Underwriters, except as may be required under (a) state securities or blue sky laws or (b) the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
2.             The Company is not required to register as an "investment company", as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940.
Unsecured Debt Securities", "Supplemental Description of the Senior Notes" and "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences", insofar as such statements purport to summarize the provisions of the laws and documents referred to therein, present fair summaries of such documents.

The Company may redeem the Notes due 2036 at any time, in whole or in part, at a "make whole" redemption price equal to the greater of (i) the principal amount of such Notes due 2036 being redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the notes being redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Yield (as defined below) plus 25 basis points, plus accrued interest to the date of redemption.
                "Treasury Yield" means, for any redemption date, (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining term, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Yield will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month); or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.  The Treasury Yield will be calculated on the third business day preceding the date fixed for redemption.

XCEL ENERGY INC., a corporation of the State of Minnesota (the "Company"), for value received hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co. or registered assigns, the principal sum of                      DOLLARS on the Maturity Date set forth above, and to pay interest thereon from the Original Issue Date (or if this Global Security has two or more Original Issue Dates, interest shall, beginning on each such Original Issue Date, begin to accrue for that part of the principal amount to which that Original Issue Date is applicable) set forth above or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semiannually in arrears on the January 1  and July 1 in each year, commencing January 1, 2007, at the per annum Interest Rate set forth above, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. No

On or before 11:30 a.m., New York City time, or such other time as shall be agreed upon between the Trustee and the Depository, of the day on which principal, interest payable at maturity and premium, if any, is due on this Global Security and following receipt of the necessary funds from the Company, the Trustee shall deposit with the Depository the amount equal to the principal, interest payable at maturity and premium, if any, by wire transfer into the account specified by the Depository. As a condition to the payment, on the Maturity Date or upon redemption or acceleration, of any part of the principal and applicable premium of this Global Security, the Depository shall surrender, or cause to be surrendered, this Global Security to the Trustee, whereupon a new Global Security shall be issued to the Depository.

"Treasury Yield" means, for any redemption date, (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining term, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Yield will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month); or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.  The Treasury Yield will be calculated on the third business day preceding the date fixed for redemption.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the U.S. Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes due 2036that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the notes.

Incorporated or their respective successors or, if such firms or their successors are unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) Goldman, Sachs & Co., Lehman Brothers Inc. or Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and any other primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer") designated by, and not affiliated with, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Lehman Brothers Inc. or Morgan Stanley & Co.
Incorporated and their respective successors, provided, however, that if Goldman, Sachs & Co., Lehman Brothers Inc. or Morgan Stanley & Co.

In the event of redemption of this Global Security in part only, a new Global Security or Securities of like tenor and series for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Securityholder hereof upon the surrender hereof.
 
Interest payments for this Global Security shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. In any case where any Interest Payment Date or date on which the principal of this Global Security is required to be paid is not a Business Day, then payment of principal, premium or interest need not be made on such date but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Interest Payment Date or date on which the principal of this Global Security is required to be paid and, in the case of timely payment thereof, no interest shall accrue for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or the date on which the principal of this Global Security is required to be paid.
 
The Company, at its option, and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the Indenture, will be discharged from any and all obligations in respect of the Securities (except for certain obligations including obligations to register the transfer or exchange of Securities, replace stolen, lost or mutilated Securities, maintain paying agencies and hold monies for payment in trust, all as set forth in the Indenture) if the Company deposits with the Trustee money, U.S. Government Obligations which through the payment of interest thereon and principal thereof in accordance with their terms will provide money, or a combination of money and U.S. Government Obligations, in any event in an amount sufficient, without reinvestment, to pay all the principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities on the dates such payments are due in accordance with the terms of the Securities.

Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Global Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Global Security and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon the Note.
 
As set forth in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any Securities will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to such Securities, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities affected by such Event of Default shall have made written request and offered reasonable indemnity to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as Trustee and the Trustee shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; provided, however, that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of and any premium or interest on this Note on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee, directly or through an Authenticating Agent by manual signature of an authorized officer, this Global Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
