Item 8.01. Other Events
On April 14, 2006, Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo), a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy, filed an application with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to increase its base electric rates by approximately $210 million annually, which includes $30 million in purchase power capacity costs through an adjustment clause, referred to as the PCCA.  PSCo proposed an 11 percent return on equity and reflected a capital structure having 59.93 percent equity.  The CPUC suspended PSCo's request to increase rates and set the matter for hearing.
On Aug. 18, 2006, PSCo received testimony from 11 intervenor groups, including the staff of the CPUC and the Office of Consumer Counsel (OCC). The intervenor testimony addressed a multitude of cost-of-service issues and recommended various reductions to PSCo's requested increase.  The intervenors' recommended increases ranged from $24.8 million to $91.4 million, exclusive of PCCA revenue.  The CPUC staff recommended an overall base rate increase of $70.5 million.  In addition, the staff generally agreed with PSCo's proposal for a PCCA mechanism through Dec. 31, 2009.  The staff's filed case incorporates a 9.5 percent return on equity, adopts PSCo's recommended capital structure and reduces depreciation expense by $19.6 million annually.  The staff also uses an average-rate-base method to calculate the cost of the construction work in progress of the new 750-megawatt pulverized coal-fired unit being constructed at the existing Comanche generating plant near Pueblo, Colo., for which recovery will be included in current rates.
The OCC recommended an overall base rate increase of $24.8 million, which incorporates an 8.5 percent return on equity, adopts PSCo's capital structure and reduces depreciation expense by $40.5 million annually.
PSCo's rebuttal testimony is expected to be filed on Sept. 29, 2006 with hearings expected to commence on Oct. 23, 2006.  New rates are expected to become effective on or about Jan. 1, 2007.
