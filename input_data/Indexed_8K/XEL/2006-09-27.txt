Item 8.01. Other Events
As previously disclosed, on May 31, 2006, Southwestern Public Service Company (SPS), a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy, filed a Texas retail electric rate case requesting an increase in annual revenues of approximately $48 million.  The rate filing is based on a historical test year, an electric rate base of $943 million, a requested rate of return on equity of 11.6 percent and a common equity ratio of 51.1 percent.
Texas Retail Base Rate Case 
On Sept. 25, 2006, SPS filed modifications to its rate case to support an additional increase of $15 million in annual revenues, to approximately $63 million.  The principal revision involves SPS' jurisdictional allocator and the overstatement of wholesale transmission revenue credits.  In order to establish new rates as quickly as possible, SPS does not currently anticipate refiling the entire case and would, therefore, be limited to the $48 million increase originally requested.  A new procedural schedule in the case is expected to be established.  Final rates are now expected to be effective in the second quarter of 2007.  No interim rate increase has been implemented.
 As disclosed in Xcel Energy's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, on May 5, 2006, SPS requested authority to surcharge approximately $43.9 million of Texas retail fuel and purchased energy cost under-collection that accrued from October 2005 through March 2006.  During the course of this proceeding, certain customers challenged whether a wholesale firm sales contract that SPS has with El Paso Electric Company (EPE) satisfied the terms of a non-unanimous stipulation, dated April 25, 2005, and the PUCT's final order, dated Dec. 19, 2005, which established the terms under which SPS would be allowed to recover system average fuel cost from certain wholesale firm sales contracts until the issue is addressed in SPS' base rate case.  On Sept. 21, 2006, the PUCT announced its decision that the contract with EPE, which was entered into in July 2004, and prior to the non-unanimous stipulation and final order referred to above and which commenced delivery on Jan. 1, 2006, did not conform to the non-unanimous stipulation and the PUCT's December 2005 final order and, as a result, disallowed approximately $1.8 million in fuel costs for the period covering October 2005 through March of 2006.  The PUCT's written final order has not yet been issued, but will control fuel cost recovery for the current EPE contract until a final order in the pending retail rate case discussed above is issued.  If the September 21 decision stands, a preliminary estimate indicates the disallowance could approximate $8 million in 2006, however SPS would explore possible steps to mitigate the impact of the September 21 decision.
