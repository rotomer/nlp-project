Exhibit 99.01
October 26, 2006
MINNEAPOLIS  Xcel Energy Inc. (NYSE: XEL) announced income from continuing operations of $224 million, or 53 cents per share on a diluted basis, for the third quarter of 2006, compared with $198 million, or 47 cents per share, in the third quarter of 2005.
Net income for the quarter, which includes the impact of discontinued operations, was $224 million, or 53 cents per share, in 2006, compared with $196 million, or 47 cents per share, in 2005.
Xcel Energy's net income for the third quarter of 2006 included the following:
                 
Regulated utility income from continuing operations was $228 million, or 53 cents per share, compared with $194 million, or 46 cents per share, in 2005;
                 
Holding company charges from continuing operations were $1 million, or less than 1 cent per share, compared with income of $6 million, or 1 cent per share in 2005; and
                 
Income from discontinued operations was $0.3 million, or less than 1 cent per share, compared with a loss of $2 million, or less than 1 cent per share, in 2005.
Increased earnings for the third quarter of 2006 were primarily due to stronger base electric and natural gas utility margins.  The stronger utility margins reflect weather-adjusted retail electric sales growth, electric and natural gas rate increases in various jurisdictions, as well as revenue associated with investments in the Metropolitan Emissions Reduction Project.
"We have put together three solid quarters this year, demonstrating overall execution of our business plan.  As a result, we believe that we are well positioned for our annual earnings from continuing operations to be in the upper half of our 2006 guidance range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share," said Richard C. Kelly, chairman, president and chief executive officer.  "With this earnings release we are initiating 2007 earnings guidance of $1.35 to $1.45 per share from continuing operations."
At 9 a.m. CDT today, Xcel Energy will host a conference call to review third quarter financial results.  To participate in the conference call, please dial in five to 10 minutes prior to the scheduled start and follow the operator's instructions.
 
The conference call also will be simultaneously broadcast and archived on Xcel Energy's Web site at www.xcelenergy.com.  To access the presentation, click on Investor Information.

Due to the seasonality of Xcel Energy's operating results, quarterly financial results are not an appropriate base from which to project annual results.
Note 1.  Earnings per Share Summary
The following table summarizes the earnings-per-share contributions of Xcel Energy's businesses.
 
The following table summarizes significant components contributing to the changes in the third quarter and year-to-date 2006 earnings per share compared with the same periods in 2005, which are discussed in more detail later in the release.
 
Note 2.  Regulated Utility Segment Results  Continuing Operations
The following summarizes the estimated impact of temperature variations on utility results included in continuing operations, compared with sales under normal weather conditions.
Estimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings
 
 The following table summarizes Xcel Energy's regulated utility growth from continuing operations for actual and weather-normalized energy sales for the three- and nine-month periods ended Sept. 30, 2006, compared with the same periods in 2005.
Sales Growth
 
Due to the low volume of natural gas sales for the third quarter, the firm natural gas sales growth is not a meaningful measure.

The following table details the revenue and margin for base electric utility, short-term wholesale and commodity trading activities that are included in continuing operations.
Base Electric Utility, Short-term Wholesale and
Commodity Trading Margins
 
Note  The short-term wholesale and commodity trading results in the above table reflect the estimated impacts of the regulatory sharing of certain margins.
- Base electric utility margin, which is primarily derived from retail customer sales, increased approximately $57 million for the third quarter of 2006 and approximately $193 million in the first nine months of 2006, compared with the same periods in 2005.  For more information on quarter and year-to-date changes, see the table below.
Base Electric Utility Margin
 
The transmission fee classification changed from other operating and maintenance expenses-utility in 2005 to electric utility margin in 2006, with no impact on operating income or net income.  The change resulted from an analysis conducted in conjunction with the expiration and renegotiation of certain transmission agreements, resulting in better alignment of reporting for such costs consistent with the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator (MISO) classification.
Short-term wholesale margins consist of energy-related purchase and sales activity and the use of certain financial instruments associated with the fuel required for and energy produced from Xcel Energy's generation assets and energy and capacity purchased to serve native load.  Commodity trading margins are not associated with Xcel Energy's generation assets or the capacity and energy purchased to serve native load.
Short-term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Margins -
As expected, short-term wholesale margins declined for the first nine months of 2006 compared with the same period in 2005, due to retail sales growth, which reduced surplus generation available for sale in the wholesale market, decreased opportunities to sell due to the MISO centralized dispatch market, and the Minnesota rate case settlement agreement to refund to customers the majority of short-term wholesale margins attributable to Minnesota jurisdiction customers starting in 2006.
-The following table details the changes in natural gas utility revenue and margin. The cost of natural gas tends to vary with changing sales requirements and the unit cost of natural gas purchases. However, due to purchased natural gas cost recovery mechanisms for sales to retail customers, fluctuations in the cost of natural gas have little effect on natural gas margin.
Natural Gas Utility Margins
 
The following summarizes the components of the changes in natural gas margin for the three and nine months ended Sept. 30:
 
 Other operating and maintenance expenses for the third quarter of 2006 increased $10 million, or 2.6 percent, compared with the same period in 2005. The increase is primarily due to higher performance based employee benefit costs for the quarter based on year-to-date results, and higher nuclear and combustion/hydro plant costs.  Partially offsetting the increase is the reclassification of year-to-date transmission expense to electric margin previously discussed, which has no impact on net income.
Other Operating and Maintenance Expenses  Utility
Other operating and maintenance expenses for the first nine months of 2006 increased $49 million, or 3.9 percent, compared with the same period in 2005. Higher employee benefit costs, which are primarily performance-based, and higher nuclear and combustion/hydro plant costs were offset by lower nuclear plant outage costs and the transmission reclassification mentioned above.  For more information, see the following table:
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense The increase is due to normal plant additions and an approved change in decommissioning accruals resulting in an additional depreciation expense of $5.2 million for the quarter and $15 million year-to-date.
Depreciation and Amortization
increased by approximately $19 million, or 9.9 percent, for the third quarter, and $40 million, or 6.9 percent, for the first nine months of 2006, compared with the same periods in 2005. 
 Income taxes for continuing operations increased by $22.4 million for the third quarter of 2006, compared with 2005.  The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to an increase in pretax income.  Income tax expense was partially offset by the reversal of a $9.8 million regulatory reserve in the third quarter of 2006 and by recognition of research and experimentation credits and net operating loss carry back claims of $10.4 million in the third quarter of 2005.  The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 27.0 percent for the third quarter of 2006, compared with 23.5 percent for the same period in 2005.  The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the forecasted annual effective tax rate for 2006 as compared to 2005.  Without the additional
Income Taxes
tax benefits, the effective tax rate would have been 30.2 percent in the third quarter of 2006 and 27.5 percent in the third quarter of 2005.
Income taxes for continuing operations increased by $26.7 million for the first nine months of 2006, compared with 2005.  The increase in income taxes was primarily due to an increase in pretax income.  The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 25.0 percent for the first nine months of 2006, compared with 24.6 percent for the same period in 2005.  The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the forecasted annual effective tax rate in 2006, compared with 2005.  Without the additional tax benefits, the effective tax rate would have been 29.3 percent for the first nine months of 2006 and 26.5 percent for the first nine months of 2005.
Note 3.  Xcel Energy Capital Structure
The following is the capital structure of Xcel Energy at Sept. 30, 2006:
 
Note 4.  Rates and Regulation
NSP-Minnesota requested an electric rate increase in Minnesota of $156 million, based on a requested 11 percent return on common equity, a projected common equity to total capitalization ratio of 51.7 percent and a projected electric rate base of $3.2 billion.
NSP-Minnesota Electric Rate Case 
On Sept. 1, 2006, the Minnesota Public Utility Commission (MPUC) issued a written order granting an electric revenue increase of approximately $131 million for 2006 based on an authorized return on equity of 10.54 percent. In 2007, the rate increase will be reduced to $115 million to reflect the return of Flint Hills, a large industrial customer, to the NSP-Minnesota system.  The MPUC rejected arguments by the Minnesota Office of the Attorney General regarding the recoverability of NSP-Minnesota's income tax benefits associated with NRG Energy, Inc.(NRG), a former subsidiary of Xcel Energy.
On Sept. 21, 2006, NSP-Minnesota filed a petition for reconsideration of the decision to reduce the rate increase for revenues associated with the return of Flint Hills, and the recoverability of additional tree trimming expense.  Other parties filed petitions regarding income tax benefits associated with NRG and a clarification of certain order language.    The MPUC has scheduled a hearing on Nov. 10, 2006, to consider the petitions for reconsideration.
In 2006, PSCo filed with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to increase electricity rates by $208 million annually, beginning Jan. 1, 2007. The request is based on a return on equity of 11 percent, an equity ratio of 59.9 percent and an electric rate base of $3.4 billion.  No interim rate increase has been implemented.
Public Service Co. of Colorado (PSCo) Electric Rate Case 
On Oct. 20, 2006, PSCo entered into a comprehensive settlement agreement with several of the parties to the case, including the CPUC staff, the Office of Consumer Counsel, the Colorado Energy Consumers, The Kroger Co., Climax Molybdenum Company, and the Commercial Group.  If approved by the CPUC, the settlement would authorize an overall rate increase, effective Jan. 1, 2007. The settlement provides for an increase in base rates of
$107 million, including an increase to depreciation expense of approximately $13.8 million and use of year-end 2006 rate base treatment for Comanche construction work in progress costs; an estimated $39.4 million in purchased capacity cost adjustment (PCCA) revenue and an estimated $4.6 million in electric commodity adjustment (ECA) revenue to recover certain WindSource program costs.  As a part of the total revenue increase of $151 million, the settlement also included the following terms:
                 
A 10.50 percent return on equity and a 60 percent equity ratio;
                 
A PCCA rider for all purchased capacity costs, with no revenue credit;
                 
Recovery of certain WindSource-related costs through the ECA and the remainder through WindSource rates;
                 
Implementation of a residential late payment fee of 1.00 percent; and
                 
Recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs through the ECA
The parties requested that the CPUC hold hearings on the settlement beginning on Nov. 2, 2006.
 On May 31, 2006, SPS filed a Texas retail electric rate case requesting an increase in annual revenues of approximately $48 million, or 6.0 percent.  The rate filing is based on a historical test year, an electric rate base of $943 million, a requested return on equity of 11.6 percent and a common equity ratio of 51.1 percent.
Southwestern Public Service Co. (SPS)-Texas Electric Rate Case
On Sept. 25, 2006, SPS filed corrections to its rate case revenue requirements calculations, increasing the revenue requirements an additional $15 million, to approximately $63 million.  The principal revision involves SPS' jurisdictional allocator and the overstatement of wholesale transmission revenue credits.  In order to establish new rates as quickly as possible, SPS did not refile the entire case.  As a result, SPS will be limited to the $48 million increase originally requested.  Final rates are now expected to be effective in the second quarter of 2007.  No interim rate increase has been implemented.  A new procedural schedule in the case is listed below.
 
Note 5.  Capital Expenditure Forecast
The capital expenditure programs of Xcel Energy are subject to continuing review and modification.  Actual utility construction expenditures may vary from the estimates due to changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth, the desired reserve margin and the availability of purchased power, compliance with current and future environmental requirements, as well as alternative plans for meeting Xcel Energy's long-term energy needs.  Plans for meeting future resource needs are subject to the review, potential modification and approval by regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions in which Xcel Energy operates.
The following is the consolidated Xcel Energy capital expenditure forecast:
 
The following is an update of the capital expenditure forecast for each of the utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy:
 
- In August 2004, Xcel Energy announced plans to pursue 20-year license renewals for the Monticello and Prairie Island nuclear plants, whose licenses will expire between 2010 and 2014.  License renewal applications for Monticello were submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the MPUC in early 2005.  License renewal is expected to be approved by the NRC in November 2006, and the MPUC issued its approval in October 2006 allowing additional spent fuel storage.  The MPUC stayed the order until June 2007, following the Minnesota legislative session.  Similar applications will be submitted for Prairie Island in 2008, with approval expected in 2010.
Nuclear Capacity Increases and Life Extension
At the direction of the MPUC, Xcel Energy is pursuing capacity increases at all three units that will total approximately 250 megawatts, to be implemented, if approved, between 2009 and 2015.  The life extension and capacity increase for Prairie Island Unit 2 is contingent on replacement of Unit 2's original steam generators, currently planned for replacement during the refueling outage in 2013.  Total capital investment for these activities is estimated to be approximately $1 billion between 2006 and 2015.  Xcel Energy plans to seek approval for an alternative recovery mechanism from customers of its' nuclear costs.
