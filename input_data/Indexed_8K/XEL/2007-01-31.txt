Exhibit 99.01
414 Nicollet Mall
Minneapolis, MN 55401
January 31, 2007
MINNEAPOLIS  Xcel Energy Inc. (NYSE: XEL) announced income from continuing operations of $569 million, or $1.35 per share on a diluted basis, for 2006, compared with $499 million, or $1.20 per share in 2005.
Total earnings for the year, which include the impact of discontinued operations, were $572 million or $1.36 per share, compared with $513 million or $1.23 per share in 2005.
Xcel Energy's earnings for 2006 included the following:
                 
Regulated utility income from continuing operations was $606 million, or $1.41 per share, compared with $539 million, or $1.27 per share, in 2005;
                 
Holding company charges from continuing operations were $26 million, or 6 cents per share, compared with $30 million, or 7 cents per share in 2005; and
                 
Discontinued operations income was $3 million, or 1 cent per share, compared with income of $14 million, or 3 cents per share, in 2005.
Increased earnings for 2006 were primarily due to a stronger base electric utility margin. The higher margin reflects electric rate increases in various jurisdictions, weather-adjusted retail electric sales growth and revenue associated with investments in the Metropolitan Emissions Reduction Project.
In addition, earnings increased due to the recognition of income tax benefits.
Partially offsetting these positive factors were expected increases in expenses for operations, maintenance and depreciation and lower short-term wholesale margins.
"On many fronts, 2006 was an outstanding year," said Richard C. Kelly, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We realized earnings at the top of our guidance range. Constructive conclusions were reached in our electric rate cases in both Minnesota and Colorado. Customer service reliability has improved compared to the previous year. Construction of our major projects is running smoothly and both the Metropolitan Emissions Reduction Project and the Comanche 3 coal-fired power plant in Colorado remain on track.
"
The results achieved in 2006 are further evidence that our Build the Core strategy is working for both our shareholders and customers. We will continue to invest in projects that meet our customers' needs, including potential projects to reduce emissions and extend the life of our Sherco plant, to own wind generation and to invest in natural gas transmission and storage facilities. Our guidance for 2007 continues to be $1.35 to $1.45 per share, and we remain confident we can grow earnings 5 to 7 percent annually on a normalized basis

Due to the seasonality of Xcel Energy's operating results, quarterly financial results are not an appropriate base from which to project annual results.
Note 1. Earnings per Share Summary
The following table summarizes the earnings-per-share contributions of Xcel Energy's businesses.
 
 
The following table summarizes significant components contributing to the changes in the fourth quarter and year-to-date 2006 earnings per share compared with the same periods in 2005, which are discussed in more detail later in the release.
 
 
Note 2. Regulated Utility Segment Results  Continuing Operations
 The following summarizes the estimated impact of temperature variations on utility results included in continuing operations, compared with sales under normal weather conditions.
Estimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings
 
 
 
The following table summarizes Xcel Energy's regulated utility growth from continuing operations for actual and weather-normalized energy sales for the three- and 12-month periods ended Dec. 31, 2006, compared with the same periods in 2005.
Sales Growth
 
 The following table details the revenue and margin for base electric utility, short-term wholesale and commodity trading activities that are included in continuing operations.
Base Electric Utility, Short-term Wholesale and
Commodity Trading Margins
 
 
Note  The short-term wholesale and commodity trading results in the above table reflect the estimated impacts of the regulatory sharing of certain margins.
Base electric utility margins, which are primarily derived from retail customer sales, increased approximately $37 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with the fourth quarter of 2005. Base electric utility margins increased approximately $226 million for 2006, compared with 2005. For more information see the following table:
 
 
The transmission fee classification changed from other operating and maintenance expenses-utility in 2005 to electric utility margin in 2006, with no impact on operating income or net income. The change resulted from an analysis conducted in conjunction with the expiration and renegotiation of certain transmission agreements, resulting in better alignment of reporting for such costs consistent with Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc. (MISO) classification.
Short-term wholesale margins consist of energy-related purchase and sales activity and the use of financial instruments associated with the fuel required for and energy produced from Xcel Energy's generation assets and energy and capacity purchased to serve native load. Commodity trading margins are not associated with Xcel Energy's generation assets or the capacity and energy purchased to serve native load.
Short-term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Margins -
As expected, short-term wholesale margins declined in 2006 due to retail sales growth, which reduced generation available for sale in the wholesale market, reductions in the availability of the coal-fired, King plant due to the MERP project, decreased opportunities to sell resulting from the MISO centralized dispatch market, and the Minnesota rate case settlement agreement to refund to customers the majority of short-term wholesale margins attributable to Minnesota jurisdiction customers starting in 2006.
The following table details the changes in natural gas utility revenue and margin. The cost of natural gas tends to vary with changing sales requirements and the unit cost of natural gas purchases. However, due to purchased natural gas cost recovery mechanisms for sales to retail customers, fluctuations in the cost of natural gas have little effect on natural gas margin.
Natural Gas Utility Margins 
 
 
The following summarizes the components of the changes in natural gas margin for the three and 12 months ended Dec. 31:
 
 
 Other operating and maintenance expenses for the fourth quarter of 2006 increased $16 million, or 3.5 percent, compared with the same period in 2005. The increase is primarily due to higher performance-based employee benefit costs for the quarter, and higher nuclear and combustion/hydro plant costs.
Other Operating and Maintenance Expenses  Utility
Partially offsetting the increase is the reclassification of transmission expense to electric margin previously discussed, which has no impact on net income, as well as the recognition of gains associated with the sale of certain assets, including the Oklahoma and Kansas delivery system operations of Southwestern Public Service Co. (SPS) and steel railcars of Public Service Co. of Colorado (PSCo). In conjunction with a regulatory decision, a $17 million regulatory asset was established associated with Private Fuel Storage costs.
Other operating and maintenance expenses for 2006 increased $64 million, or 3.8 percent, compared with 2005. Higher employee benefit costs, which are primarily performance-based, and higher nuclear and combustion/hydro plant costs were offset by lower nuclear plant outage costs, the transmission reclassification, gains on sale of assets, and the establishment of the Private Fuel Storage regulatory asset, mentioned above. For more information, see the following table:
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense The decommissioning accruals increased by $20 million in 2006, reflecting regulatory recovery decisions. Normal plant additions accounted for the remaining increase in depreciation expense for 2006 over 2005
Depreciation and Amortization
increased by approximately $15 million, or 7.9 percent, for the fourth quarter, and $55 million, or 7.1 percent, for the 12 months of 2006, compared with the same periods in 2005.
.
 
 Income taxes for continuing operations decreased by $19 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with 2005. The effective tax rate was 20.2 percent for the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with 30.4 percent for the same period in 2005. The decrease in income taxes and the effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in pretax income.
Income Taxes
Income taxes for continuing operations increased by $8 million for 2006, compared with 2005. The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 24.2 percent for 2006, compared with 25.8 percent for 2005. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to an increase in pretax income, partially offset by $30 million of tax benefits from the reversal of a regulatory reserve and realized capital loss carryforwards. Without these tax benefits, the effective tax rate for 2006 would have been 28.2 percent. In 2005, tax benefits of $10 million were recorded from increased research credits and a net operating loss carry back.

The following is the capital structure of Xcel Energy at Dec. 31, 2006:
 
 
Note 4. Rates and Regulation
In 2006, NSP-Minnesota requested an electric rate increase in Minnesota of $156 million, based on a requested 11 percent return on common equity, a projected common equity to total capitalization ratio of 51.7 percent and a projected electric rate base of $3.2 billion.
Northern States Power Co., a Minnesota corporation, (NSP-Minnesota) Electric Rate Case 
On Sept. 1, 2006, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) issued a written order granting an electric revenue increase of approximately $131 million for 2006 based on an authorized return on equity of 10.54 percent. In 2007, the rate increase will be reduced to $115 million to reflect the return of Flint Hills Resources, a large industrial customer, to the NSP-Minnesota system.
In November 2006, the MPUC declined to act on petitions for reconsideration, which allows the Sept. 1, 2006, order to stand. A customer intervenor has filed a petition for review of the MPUC decision with the Minnesota Court of Appeals.
In November 2006, NSP-Minnesota filed a request with the MPUC to increase Minnesota natural gas rates by $18.5 million, which represents an increase of 2.4 percent. The request is based on 11.0 percent return on equity, a projected equity ratio of 51.98 percent and a natural gas rate base of $439 million. Interim rates, subject to refund, were set at a $15.9 million increase and went into effect on Jan. 8, 2007. A decision is expected in the summer of 2007.
NSP-Minnesota Natural Gas Rate Case 
In 2006, PSCo filed with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to increase electricity rates by $208 million annually, beginning Jan. 1, 2007. The request was based on a return on equity of 11 percent, an equity ratio of 59.9 percent and an electric rate base of $3.4 billion. No interim rate increase was implemented.
PSCo Electric Rate Case 
 
On Nov. 20, 2006, the CPUC approved a settlement agreement, which authorized an overall rate increase of $151 million, effective Jan. 1, 2007, including:
A $107 million base rate increase based on a 10.50 percent return on equity and 60 percent equity ratio.
                 
A purchased capacity cost adjustment (PCCA) rider for all capacity costs associated with new purchased power agreements that will increase 2007 revenues by $39.4 million.
                 
$4.6 million increase in Windsource-related costs recovered through the electric cost adjustment.
                 
On Dec. 1, 2006, PSCo filed with the CPUC a request to increase natural gas rates by $41.5 million, representing an overall increase of 2.96 percent. The request is based on a requested capital structure of 60.17 percent common equity, a return on common equity of 11 percent and a rate base of approximately $1.1 billion. It is anticipated that new rates will become effective in the third quarter of 2007.
PSCO Natural Gas Rate Case 
 On May 31, 2006, SPS filed a Texas retail electric rate case requesting an increase in annual revenues of approximately $48 million, or 6.0 percent. The rate filing is based on a historical test year, an electric rate base of $943 million, a requested return on equity of 11.6 percent and a common equity ratio of 51.1 percent.
SPS-Texas Electric Rate Case
On Sept. 25, 2006, SPS filed corrections to its rate case revenue requirements calculations, increasing the revenue requirements an additional $15 million, to approximately $63 million. As a result of not re-filing the entire case for these corrections, SPS will be limited to a maximum increase of $48 million, the increase originally requested. No interim rate increase has been implemented.
In addition, SPS has a pending fuel reconciliation filing, which seeks approval of approximately $957 million of Texas jurisdictional fuel and purchased power costs for 2004 through 2005. The fuel reconciliation case was transferred to the State Office of Administrative Hearing (SOAH) with the base rate case and has the same procedural schedule. As a part of the fuel reconciliation case, fuel and purchased energy costs, which are recovered in Texas through a fixed-fuel and purchased energy recovery factor as a part of SPS' retail electric rates, will be reviewed.
Various parties have filed testimony on base rate and fuel issues, including the Office of Public Utility Counsel; the state of Texas; Texas Industrial Electric Consumers; Association of Xcel Municipalities; Occidental Permian; and the Public Utility Commission of Texas Staff. Intervenor recommendations ranged from a base rate reduction of $56 million to a base rate increase of $31 million.
In the fuel reconciliation portion of the proceeding, the parties recommended several adjustments related to SPS's fuel reconciliation filing, including the methodology for assigning average fuel costs to certain firm wholesale sales, coal mitigation activities, the treatment of fuel losses and other items. The recommendation ranged from a disallowance of $8 million to a disallowance of $120 million.
SPS' rebuttal testimony was filed in January, 2007. SPS is confident that the rebuttal case adequately addressed many of the concerns raised by intervenors. Final rates are expected to be effective in the second quarter of 2007. No interim rate increase has been implemented.
SPS has recorded a reserve for various regulatory issues, including the electric rate case and the fuel reconciliations.
Note 5. Capital and Equity Investments
 On Jan. 2, 2007, NSP-Minnesota proposed an emissions reduction project at its Sherco plant in Becker, Minn., in connection with a plan to increase generating capacity at the station to meet customers' growing needs. The proposal would add a total of 140 megawatts of capacity for NSP-Minnesota's customers and take a major step toward extending the plant's life while significantly reducing emissions of mercury, nitrogen oxides,
Sherco Upgrade
sulfur dioxide and particulates. A portion of the proposal requires approval by Southern Minnesota Municipal Power Agency, which owns part of Sherco Unit 3.
By Sept. 1, 2007, NSP-Minnesota plans to file a petition seeking rate rider recovery for the project, which preliminary estimates indicate would cost approximately $900 million. Stakeholders will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal, and the MPUC is expected to rule on the proposal in 2008. If approved, NSP-Minnesota plans to begin construction on the project in late 2008 and complete work by 2012.
Wind Generation 
NSP-Minnesota is considering investing $210 million in 2009 to acquire 100-megawatts of wind generation under a build-own-transfer structure. The project would be eligible for rider recovery in Minnesota. The project requires approval by the MPUC.
 Xcel Energy holds a 50 percent interest in WYCO. In 1999, WYCO was jointly formed with a subsidiary of El Paso Corporation to develop and lease new natural gas pipeline and compression facilities. WYCO now proposes to develop additional new natural gas transportation and storage facilities in support of the natural gas delivery systems used by PSCo. Xcel Energy plans to invest approximately $145 million in WYCO between 2007 and 2009. The investment will be used to build 164 miles of natural gas transmission pipeline and natural gas storage facilities in Colorado having working gas capacity of approximately 7 billion cubic feet. The WYCO pipeline project is expected to begin operations in 2008, and the WYCO storage project is expected to begin operations in 2009. The facilities will be regulated by the FERC and leased and operated by Colorado Interstate Gas Company, an affiliate of El Paso Corporation.
