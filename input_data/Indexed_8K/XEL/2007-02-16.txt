Item 8.01. Other Events
 
As previously reported, in April 2004 Xcel Energy filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota to establish its right to deduct the interest expense that had accrued on policy loans related to its corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) policies. Also, as previously reported, Xcel Energy and the government each filed a second motion for summary judgment in 2006. Both motions were initially presented to the Magistrate Judge. On February 14, 2007 the Magistrate Judge issued his Report and Recommendation (Report), recommending that both sides' motions be denied because of disputed fact issues. Both parties will have until March 5, 2007 to file their objections to the Report to the District Court Judge. Each party will also have an additional ten days to respond to the other party's objections. Thereafter, the Judge will have broad authority to, among other things, accept or reject in whole or in part the recommendations in the Report. It is unknown when a final order will be issued with respect to the motions.
