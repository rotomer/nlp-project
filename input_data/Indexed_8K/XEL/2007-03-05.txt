February 28, 2007
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS Xcel Energy Inc. (NYSE: XEL) announced today that it has commenced an exchange offer (not a redemption) to refinance a portion of the company's outstanding long-term debt securities. The exchange offer will expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on March 27, 2007 (the "Expiration Date"), unless extended.
 
The company is offering to exchange up to $350 million aggregate principal amount of its 7% Senior Notes, Series due 2010 (the "Old Notes"). Holders of the Old Notes whose tenders are accepted will receive a new series of senior notes due April 1, 2017 (the "New Notes"). The coupon on the New Notes is expected to be determined on March 23, 2007, unless the offer is extended or terminated.
 
Consummation of the exchange offer is subject to the condition that an aggregate principal amount of Old Notes must be validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date sufficient to result in the issuance of New Notes in an aggregate principal amount of at least $250 million. A maximum of $350 million aggregate principal amount of Old Notes will be accepted. If more than $350 million aggregate principal amount of Old Notes are tendered, we will accept for exchange only Old Notes in an aggregate principal amount up to $350 million on a pro rata basis among the tendering holders.
 
The applicable total exchange price for Old Notes will include an early participation payment payable only to holders of Old Notes that validly tender and do not validly withdraw their Old Notes prior to 5:00 p.m., on New York City time, March 13, 2007 (such time and date, the "Early Participation Date"), subject to extension, and whose Old Notes are accepted for exchange.
 
The exchange offer is only made, and copies of the exchange offer documents will only be made available to, holders of Old Notes that have certified certain matters to Xcel Energy, including their status as either "qualified institutional buyers," as that term is defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, or persons other than "U.S. persons," as that term is defined in Rule 902 under the Securities Act of 1933 (collectively, "Eligible Holders"). A confidential offering memorandum, dated today, will be distributed to Eligible Holders and is available to Eligible Holders through the
 
information agent, Global Bondholder Services Corporation, at 866-488-1500 or 212-430-3774.
 
The following provides a brief summary of additional, key elements of the exchange offer:
 
 -

 - 
                                         
The applicable total exchange price for the Old Notes is based on a fixed-spread pricing formula and will be calculated at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second business day prior to the expiration of the exchange offer.

Old Notes tendered before the Early Participation Date may be withdrawn at any time prior to the Early Participation Date. Old Notes tendered after the Early Participation Date may be validly withdrawn at any time prior to the expiration of the exchange offer.
 
 - 
                                         
The New Notes will mature on April 1, 2017 and will bear interest at an annual rate, which will be determined two business days prior to the expiration of the exchange offer.
 
 -
