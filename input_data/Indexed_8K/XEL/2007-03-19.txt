Item 8.01. Other Events
 
On March 9, 2007, interveners filed testimony regarding the Minnesota gas rate case of Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota corporation, (NSP-Minnesota), which was filed with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) on Nov. 9, 2006. NSP-Minnesota is a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy. NSP-Minnesota's filing requests an increase in annual gas revenues of approximately $18.5 million or 2.4 percent. The filing requests a return on equity of 11.00 percent, assuming an equity ratio of 51.98 percent and an overall return on rate base of 9.07 percent applied to a 2007 forecasted rate base of approximately $440 million.
 
In its testimony, the Minnesota Department of Commerce recommended an increase in annual revenues of approximately $8.6 million, a return on equity of 9.71 percent and a proposed capital structure of 51.98 percent, resulting in an overall return on rate base of 8.40 percent. The primary adjustments relate to return on equity and a higher level of projected sales volume, which serve to result in a lower overall request. The Department of Commerce opposes the proposed decoupling mechanism, but proposes a collaborative effort to examine the matter outside of the current rate case proceeding.
 
The Office of Attorney General also filed testimony. It proposed 9.26 percent return on equity, and an overall rate base return of 8.16 percent. The Office of Attorney General opposed the decoupling mechanism and also proposes exploring the option outside the current rate case proceeding.

The Energy CENTS Coalition also filed testimony proposing approval of the decoupling mechanism with subsequent adjustments including a capital structure of 46 percent equity. The testimony can be viewed by going to Xcel Energy's web site at
 
An interim rate increase of approximately $15.8 million was effective January 8, 2007. The Company's rebuttal testimony is due on April 9, 2007.
