Item 8.01. Other Events
On Dec. 1, 2006, Public Service Company of Colorado ("PSCo") filed with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission ("CPUC"), a request to increase natural gas rates by $41.5 million, representing an overall increase of 2.96 percent, primarily related to capital investments and rising operating costs.  The request assumes a common equity ratio of 60.17 percent and a return on equity ("ROE") of 11 percent.  The jurisdictional rate base is approximately $1.1 billion.
On April 6, 2007, the CPUC staff and the Office of Consumer Council ("OCC") filed answer testimony to Xcel Energy's requested increase in revenue requirements. The CPUC staff recommended an overall revenue increase of $30.5 million, based on a 10 percent ROE and a 60.17 percent common equity ratio.  The only CPUC staff recommended significant adjustment to PSCo's request was associated with the ROE request. The CPUC staff also raised policy concerns regarding PSCo's partial decoupling proposal, but concluded that they neither supported nor opposed decoupling.
The OCC recommended an overall revenue decrease of $4.8 million related to three major adjustments.  First, they recommended an ROE of 9 percent assuming a 60.17 percent common equity ratio. Secondly, they proposed a consolidated income tax adjustment, the effect of which is a revenue requirement decrease of $11.9 million.  Thirdly, they proposed an adjustment to depreciation and amortization expense, resulting in a revenue requirement decrease of $10.5 million.  The OCC also recommended the disallowance of annual incentive compensation costs of $1.2 million, the revision of the weather normalization of test year revenues, the rejection of PSCo's partial decoupling proposal, and policy changes regarding PSCo's line extension policy.
Rebuttal and cross-answer testimony is due on May 11, 2007, with hearings beginning on June 4, 2007.  It is anticipated that the CPUC will act on the request such that the rates ultimately approved will become effective in the third quarter of 2007.
