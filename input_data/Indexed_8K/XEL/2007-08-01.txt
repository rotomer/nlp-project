On July 30, 2007, Southwestern Public Service Company (SPS), a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc., filed with the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission requesting a New Mexico retail electric general rate increase.  The rate filing is based on a 2006 calendar year base period adjusted for known and measurable changes and includes a requested rate of return on equity of 11.0 percent, an electric net rate base of approximately $307.3 million allocated to the New Mexico retail jurisdiction and an equity ratio of 51.2 percent.  This is the first general rate case filed by SPS in New Mexico since 1998.  The filing requests an overall increase in annual revenues of approximately $17.3 million, or a 6.6 percent increase.
