Item 8.01. Other Events
 
As previously reported, most recently in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, on June 4, 2007, Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota corporation, (NSP-Minnesota) and wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy, recommended lengthening the life of the Monticello nuclear plant by 20 years effective Jan. 1, 2007, as well as certain other smaller life adjustments as part of its annual review of remaining lives depreciation filing.
 
On July 9, 2007, the Minnesota Department of Commerce (MDOC) recommended approval of the longer lives and sought an adjustment to rate base to be used in the next electric rate case that will hold ratepayers indifferent to this change in remaining lives between rate cases. On July 19, 2007, Xcel Energy filed replies agreeing with the MDOC's recommendation and specifying the calculation of any potential future adjustment. Xcel Energy calculated the revenue requirement associated with this adjustment to be approximately $1.4 - $2.8 million, depending on the timing of the next electric rate case.
 
Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) approved NSP-Minnesota's remaining lives depreciation filing lengthening the life of the Monticello nuclear plant by 20 years retroactive to Jan. 1, 2007 as well as certain other smaller life adjustments. These adjustments, of approximately $31 million, will be reflected in NSP-Minnesota's financial statements for the quarter and period ended Sept. 30, 2007 as a reduction of depreciation expense.
