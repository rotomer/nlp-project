Item 8.01. Other Events
 
As previously reported in Xcel Energy's Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2006, in 1998 Northern States Power Company (NSP-Minnesota) filed a complaint in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (the Court) against the United States, requesting breach of contract damages for the Department of Energy's failure to begin disposing of spent nuclear fuel from NSP-Minnesota's Prairie Island and Monticello nuclear generating facilities as required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and the contracts between NSP-Minnesota and the Department of Energy.  On July 31, 2001 the Court granted NSP-Minnesota's motion for partial summary judgment on liability.  A trial on the issue of damages through 2004 commenced on Oct. 24, 2006 and concluded on Dec. 11, 2006.  Post-trial arguments were presented to the Court on May 31, 2007.
 
On Sept. 26, 2007, the Court awarded NSP-Minnesota  $116.5 million in damages.  The damage award included approximately $43.1 million for the construction and operation of on-site storage facilities; approximately $48.7 million for compliance with legislative mandates; and approximately $24.7 million to cover expenses incurred to develop an off-site private storage facility.  It is uncertain whether the government will appeal this decision.  The specific regulatory treatment related to this award will likely not be known until a final resolution is reached, but any ultimate recovery will benefit NSP-Minnesota's customers.
