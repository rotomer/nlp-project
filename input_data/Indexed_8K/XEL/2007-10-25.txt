Exhibit 99.01
 
 
 
October 25, 2007
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS  Xcel Energy Inc. (NYSE: XEL) announced income from continuing operations of $246 million, or 57 cents per share on a diluted basis, for the third quarter of 2007, compared with $214 million, or 50 cents per share, in the third quarter of 2006.
 
Net income for the quarter, which includes the impact of discontinued operations, was $252 million, or 58 cents per share, in 2007, compared with $224 million, or 53 cents per share, in 2006.
 
Xcel Energy's total earnings for the third quarter of 2007 included the following:
 - 
                 
Regulated utility earnings from continuing operations were $260 million, or 60 cents per share, compared with $217 million, or 50 cents per share, in 2006.
 - 
                 
Holding company and other costs from continuing operations were $13 million, or 3 cents per share, compared with costs of  $1 million, or less than 1 cent per share in 2006.
 - 
                 
Results from discontinued operations for 2007 were earnings of $5 million, or 1 cent per share, compared with earnings of $11 million, or 3 cents per share, in 2006.
 
Higher third quarter 2007 earnings from continuing operations were primarily attributable to higher electric margin, reflecting the positive impact of the 2007 Colorado rate increase, higher rider recovery for the Metro Emission Reduction Project (MERP) in Minnesota and sales growth.  In addition, a Minnesota Commission order to extend the depreciation lives of certain assets reduced depreciation expense for the quarter.  Partially offsetting these positive factors were higher operating and maintenance expenses, higher financing costs and a higher effective tax rate.
 
"We had
another
strong quarter demonstrating continued evidence of successful execution of our strategy," said Richard C. Kelly, chairman, president and chief executive officer.  "As a result, we are increasing our 2007 annual guidance for earnings from continuing operations from   $1.30 to $1.40 per share to $1.38 to $1.42 per share.
 
"In addition, we are initiating earnings guidance for 2008 with the range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share," said Kelly.
At 9 a.m. CDT today, Xcel Energy will host a conference call to review third quarter financial results.  To participate in the conference call, please dial in five to ten minutes prior to the scheduled start and follow the operator's instructions.

Notes to Investor Relations Release (Unaudited)
 
Due to the seasonality of Xcel Energy's operating results, quarterly financial results are not an appropriate base from which to project annual results.
 
Note 1.  Earnings per Share Summary
 
The following table summarizes the diluted earnings per share contributions of Xcel Energy's businesses.
 
 
The higher holding company and other costs in 2007 are primarily attributable to higher financing costs.  In addition, holding company and other costs were lower as a result of certain tax benefits in 2006.
 
The following table summarizes significant components contributing to the changes in the third quarter of 2007 diluted earnings per share compared with the same period in 2006, which are discussed in more detail later in the release.
 
Note 2.  Regulated Utility Segment Results  Continuing Operations
 
Estimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings
The following table summarizes the estimated impact of temperature variations on utility results included in continuing operations, compared with sales under normal weather conditions.
 
 
Sales Growth
 The following table summarizes Xcel Energy's regulated utility growth from continuing operations for actual and weather-normalized energy sales for the three- and nine-month periods ended Sept. 30, 2007, compared with the same period in 2006.
*
                
Due to the low volume of natural gas sales for the third quarter, the firm natural gas sales decline is not a meaningful measure.
 
Base Electric Utility, Short-term Wholesale and
Commodity Trading Margins
The following table details the revenues and margin for base electric utility, short-term wholesale and commodity trading activities that are included in continuing operations:
 
 
Note  The short-term wholesale and commodity trading results in the above table reflect the estimated impacts of the regulatory sharing of certain margins.
 
Base Electric Utility Margin
 
 
Short-Term Wholesale Margin
 
Short-term wholesale margins consist of energy-related purchase and sales activity and the use of certain financial instruments associated with the fuel required for and energy produced from Xcel Energy's generation assets and energy and capacity purchased to serve native load.  Commodity trading margins are not associated with Xcel Energy's generation assets or the capacity and energy purchased to serve native load.
 
Short-term wholesale and commodity trading margins decreased approximately $6 million during the third quarter of 2007 and decreased $7 million for the first nine months of 2007, when compared to the same periods in 2006.  As expected, short-term wholesale margins declined due to retail sales growth, which reduced generation available for sale in the wholesale market.
Natural Gas Utility Margins
-The following table details the changes in natural gas utility revenues and margin. The cost of natural gas tends to vary with changing sales requirements and the unit cost of natural gas purchases. However, due to purchased natural gas cost recovery mechanisms for sales to retail customers, fluctuations in the cost of natural gas have little effect on natural gas margin.
 
The following table summarizes the components of the changes in natural gas margin for the three and nine months ended Sept. 30:
 
Natural Gas Margin
 
Other Operating and Maintenance Expenses  Utility
 Other operating and maintenance expenses for the third quarter of 2007 increased by approximately $34 million, or 8.2 percent, compared with the same period in 2006.  Other operating and maintenance expenses for the first nine months of 2007 increased $53 million, or 4.1 percent, compared with the same period in 2006. For more information see the following table:
 
 
Lower current period and year-to-date performance based incentive plan expense as well as active and retiree healthcare expense due in part to lower claims experience were the primary factors contributing to the lower employee benefit costs.  The transmission fee classification change was the result of a year-to-date reclassification of transmission expense in September 2006 from other operating and maintenance expenses-utility to electric utility margin, with no impact on operating income or net income.
Depreciation and Amortization
 Depreciation and amortization expense de
creased by approximately $17 million, or 8.1 percent, for the third quarter, and increased by approximately $5 million, or 0.8 percent, for the first nine months of 2007, compared with the same periods in 2006. 
The decrease was primarily due to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) approval of NSP-Minnesota's remaining lives depreciation filing lengthening the life of the Monticello nuclear plant by 20 years, effective as of Jan. 1, 2007, as well as certain other smaller plant life adjustments.  The adjustments from this order resulted in an approximately $31 million reduction of depreciation expense in the third quarter.  The completion of the upgrade to the King plant, which came on-line in July 2007,  increased depreciation expense this quarter by $3.5 million.  These two events, when combined with the normal increase in depreciation expense from increased capital expenditures for planned system expansion, resulted in the net $17 million decrease for the quarter.
 
Income taxes
 Income taxes for continuing operations increased by $38 million for the third quarter of 2007, compared with 2006.  The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to an increase in pretax income. The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 35.6 percent for the third quarter of 2007, compared with 31.4 percent for the same period in 2006.  The lower effective tax rate for third quarter 2006 was primarily due to tax benefits
of $9.8 million associated with the reversal of a regulatory reserve related to income taxes in the third quarter 2006
.  Excluding this benefit, the effective tax rate for third quarter 2006 would have been 34.6 percent.
 
Income taxes for continuing operations increased by $65 million for the first nine months of 2007, compared with 2006.  The increase in income tax expense was due to an increase in pretax income in 2007.  In addition, the effective tax rate was lower in 2006 due to the recognition of $27 million of tax benefits from the reversal of a regulatory reserve related to income taxes and realized capital loss carryforwards. 
The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 34.5 percent for the first nine months of 2007, compared with 29.5 percent for the same period in 2006.  Excluding these benefits, the effective tax rate for the first nine months 2006 would have been 33.7 percent.
 
Note 3.  Results from Discontinued Operations
 
A summary of the earnings per share - diluted components of discontinued operations is as follows:
 
 
IRS Corporate-Owned Life Insurance (COLI) Settlement
 
Xcel Energy and the U.S. government have had an ongoing dispute regarding PSCo's right to deduct interest expense on policy loans related to its COLI program that insured lives of certain PSCo employees.  These policies are owned and managed by PSR Investments, Inc. (PSRI).  PSRI is a wholly owned subsidiary of PSCo.  The total exposure for the tax years in dispute through 2007 was approximately $583 million, which includes income tax, interest and potential penalties.
 
On June 19, 2007, Xcel Energy and the United States reached a settlement in principle resolving the dispute regarding the proper tax treatment of COLI policies.
 
On Sept. 20, 2007, Xcel Energy submitted its formal offer in compromise to settle the dispute relating to the proper tax treatment of the COLI policies beginning with tax year 1993 and for all years thereafter. On Sept. 21, 2007, the United States accepted the terms of that settlement offer, which are essentially the same as the settlement in principle reached on June 19, 2007.  The U.S. government's letter terminates the tax litigation pending between the parties for tax years 1993-2002 and also specifies the agreed tax treatment for certain aspects of those policies for subsequent tax years.
Terms of the Final Settlement
 
The essential financial terms of the settlement, as accepted, are as follows:
 - 
                 
Xcel Energy will pay the government a total of $64.4 million in full settlement of the government's claims for tax, penalty, and interest for tax years 1993-2007.
 - 
                 
Xcel Energy will pay that settlement amount as follows:
 - 
                 
$32.2 million of that amount will be satisfied by tax and interest amounts that Xcel Energy has paid or is deemed under the terms of the settlement to have made to the government with respect to tax years 1993 and 1994.
 - 
                 
Xcel Energy will satisfy the remaining settlement amount owed by paying the government $32.2 by Oct. 31, 2007.
 - 
                 
The total settlement amount will be allocated toward specified amounts of tax, penalty, and interest owed for 1993 and 1994 and other amounts of tax and interest owed for 1995.
 - 
                 
Except as stated above, Xcel Energy will be entitled to claim COLI related interest deductions for tax years 1995-2007.
 - 
                 
Xcel Energy will surrender the policies to its insurer by Oct. 31, 2007 without having to recognize a taxable gain on the surrender.
 
As a result of the settlement, which will allow PSRI to unwind the COLI program in a tax efficient manner, PSRI will no longer receive a tax benefit associated with COLI or incur the costs of the COLI program.  The earnings from PSRI and the COLI settlement costs are accounted for as discontinued operations.
 
Note 4. Xcel Energy Capital Structure and Financing
 
Following is the preliminary capital structure of Xcel Energy at Sept. 30, 2007:
 
 
During the fourth quarter, Xcel Energy anticipates issuing approximately $400 to $500 million of hybrid securities (debt securities with a 60-year final term that receive partial equity credit from the rating agencies) to fund equity investments in our utility subsidiaries and repay short-term debt.
 
Note 5.  Rates and Regulation
 
NSP  Wisconsin Electric and Gas Rate Case Filing -
On June 1, 2007, NSP-Wisconsin filed with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) a request to increase retail electric rates by $67.4 million and retail natural gas rates by $5.3 million, representing overall increases of 14.3 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively.  The request assumes a common equity ratio of 53.86 percent and a return on equity of 11.00 percent and combined electric and natural gas rate base of approximately $640 million.
On Oct. 15, 2007, the PSCW staff and intervenors filed testimony in response to NSP-Wisconsin's requested increase. The PSCW staff recommended an electric rate increase of approximately $44.1 million and a natural gas rate increase of $4.3 million, based on a return on equity of 10.75 percent and a common equity ratio of 53.58 percent.  The PSCW staff testimony recommended adjustments that would decrease NSP-Wisconsin's electric request by approximately $23.3 million.  Approximately half of the PSCW staff's adjustments are based on new or revised data since the filing was prepared.  Specifically, PSCW staff increased 2008 forecast electric revenues based on a more recent forecast of electric sales and energy losses and also recognized the increased revenues generated by the electric fuel surcharge approved by the PSCW on Oct. 11, 2007.  These adjustments, if accepted by the PSCW, will not have an earnings impact on NSP-Wisconsin.  The remaining adjustments, discussed in PSCW staff testimony, relate to reductions in rate base, operating and maintenance expenses and amortization expenses.
 
Rebuttal testimony is due on Oct. 29, 2007.  Technical and public hearings are scheduled for Nov. 8, 2007, and Nov. 12, 2007, respectively.  The PSCW is expected to act upon the request in December 2007 and new rates are expected to be implemented in early 2008.
 
NSP  Minnesota Annual Review of Remaining Lives Depreciation Filing 
On June 4, 2007, NSP-Minnesota recommended lengthening the life of the Monticello nuclear plant by 20 years, effective Jan. 1, 2007, as well as certain other smaller life adjustments as part of its annual review of remaining lives depreciation filing.
 
On Sept. 20, 2007, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) approved NSP-Minnesota's remaining lives depreciation filing lengthening the life of the Monticello nuclear plant by 20 years, effective as of Jan. 1, 2007, as well as certain other smaller life adjustments. In addition, the MPUC also approved an adjustment to rate base to be used in the next electric rate case that will hold ratepayers indifferent to this change in remaining lives between rate cases. NSP-Minnesota calculated the revenue requirement associated with this adjustment to be approximately $1.4 to $2.8 million, depending on the timing of the next electric rate case.  As a result, depreciation expense was reduced approximately $31 million in the third quarter of 2007.
 
New Mexico Electric Rate Case-
On July 30, 2007, SPS filed with the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC) requesting a New Mexico retail electric general rate increase of $17.3 million annually or a 6.6 percent increase.  The rate filing is based on a 2006 calendar year base period adjusted for known and measurable changes and includes a requested rate of return on equity of 11.0 percent, an electric net rate base of approximately $307.3 million allocated to the New Mexico retail jurisdiction and an equity ratio of 51.2 percent.  The NMPRC suspended the requested effective date for an additional nine months beyond the requested effective date.   Intervenor testimony is due Dec. 21, 2007, and hearings are scheduled for Jan. 28-Feb. 1, 2008.  A decision on the request is expected in the second quarter of 2008, and final rates are expected to be implemented in mid-2008.
 
Note 6.  Legal Proceedings
 
In 1998, NSP-Minnesota filed a complaint in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims against the United States, requesting breach of contract damages for the Department of Energy's failure to begin disposing of spent nuclear fuel from Prairie Island and Monticello.
 
On Sept. 26, 2007, the Court awarded NSP-Minnesota $116.5 million.  The damage award included $43 million for the construction and operation of on-site storage facilities; $49 million for compliance with legislative mandates; and $25 million to cover expenses associated with efforts to develop an off-site private storage facility.
 
Results of the judgment will not be recorded in earnings until cash is received and the regulatory treatment and amounts to be shared with rate payers has been resolved.  Given the uncertainty of a potential appeal and regulatory treatment by the various utility commissions, it is unclear as to how much, if any, of this judgment will ultimately have a net impact on earnings.
Note 7.  Xcel Energy Capital Expenditure Forecast
 
The capital expenditure programs of Xcel Energy are subject to continuing review and modification.  Actual utility construction expenditures may vary from the estimates due to changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth, the desired reserve margin and the availability of purchased power, compliance with current and future environmental requirements, as well as alternative plans for meeting Xcel Energy's long-term energy needs.  Plans for meeting future resource needs are subject to the review, potential modification and approval by regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions in which Xcel Energy operates.
 
The following is the consolidated Xcel Energy capital expenditure forecast:
 
 
Consistent with Xcel Energy's strategy, potential resource plan projects primarily represent wind generation, including required transmission, as well as natural gas generation that likely will result from the Colorado and Minnesota resource plans, which will be filed in the fourth quarter of 2007.  These potential projects will require commission approval.
