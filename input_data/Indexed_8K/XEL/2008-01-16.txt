(1)           if the issuance of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner that is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee;
 
(2)           if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be taken; or
 
(3)           if the Trustee in good faith by its Board of Directors, executive officers or a trust committee of directors and/or responsible officers determines that such action would expose the Trustee to personal liability to Holders of any outstanding Securities.
 
(e)           No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by the manual signature of an authorized officer, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.

Any such request shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Company that the statements made in the Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee prior to the authentication and issuance of the first Security of such series are true and correct on the date thereof as if made on and as of the date thereof.

Securities to be exchanged shall be surrendered at any of the offices or agencies to be maintained pursuant to Section 5.2 hereof, and the Trustee shall deliver in exchange therefor the Security or Securities which the Securityholder making the exchange shall be entitled to receive.
 
(b)           The Trustee shall keep, at one of said offices or agencies, a register or registers in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Trustee shall register or cause to be registered Securities and shall register or cause to be registered the transfer of Securities as provided in this Article II.  Such register shall be in written form or in any other form capable of being converted into written form within a reasonable time.  At all reasonable times, such register shall be open for inspection by the Company.  Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of any Security at any such office or agency, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall register, authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees one or more new Securities of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount, series and stated maturity and having the same terms and Original Issue Date or Dates.

Section 2.7            Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost Or Stolen Securities
 
(a)           If any temporary or definitive Security shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company shall execute, and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, a new Security of like form and principal amount and having the same terms and Original Issue Date or Dates and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Security, or in lieu of and in substitution for the Security so destroyed, lost or stolen.  In every case the applicant for a substituted Security shall furnish to the Company, the Trustee and any paying agent or Authenticating Agent such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft of a Security, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company and to the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
 
(b)           The Trustee shall authenticate any such substituted Security and deliver the same upon the written request or authorization of any officer of the Company.  Upon the issuance of any substituted Security, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses connected therewith.  If any Security which has matured, is about to mature, has been redeemed or called for redemption shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substituted Security, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Security) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company, the Trustee and any paying agent or Authenticating Agent such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless and, in case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
 
(c)           Every substituted Security issued pursuant to this Section 2.7 by virtue of the fact that any Security is mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not such destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be found at any time, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities duly issued hereunder.  All Securities shall be held and owned upon the express condition that, to the extent permitted by law, the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
 
  Pending the preparation of definitive Securities, the Company may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver temporary Securities (printed, lithographed or otherwise reproduced).  Temporary Securities shall be issuable in any authorized denomination and substantially in the form of the definitive Securities but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Company.  Every such temporary Security shall be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with the same effect, as the definitive Securities.  Without unreasonable delay the Company shall execute and shall deliver to the Trustee definitive Securities and thereupon any or all temporary Securities shall be surrendered in exchange therefor at the corporate

trust office of the Trustee, and the Trustee shall authenticate, deliver and register in exchange for such temporary Securities an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities.  Such exchange shall be made by the Company at its own expense and without any charge therefor to the Securityholders.  Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities authenticated and delivered hereunder.
 
  All Securities surrendered for the purpose of payment, redemption, exchange or registration of transfer shall be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation and promptly canceled by it and no Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by this Indenture.  The Company's acquisition of any Securities shall operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities and such Securities shall be surrendered by the Company to and canceled by the Trustee.

In that event, when moneys become available for payment of the interest, the Trustee shall (a) establish a date of payment of such interest and a Special Record Date for the payment of that interest, which Special Record Date shall be not more than 15 or fewer than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and (b) mail notice of the date of payment and of the Special Record Date not fewer than 10 days preceding the Special Record Date to each Securityholder of such series at the close of business on the 15th day preceding the mailing at the address of such Securityholder, as it appeared on the register for the Securities.

As a condition to the payment, at maturity or upon redemption, of any part of the principal of, interest on and applicable premium of any Global Security, the Depository shall surrender, or cause to be surrendered, such Global Security to the Trustee, whereupon a new Global Security shall be issued to the Depository pursuant to Section 2.6(f) hereof.

Unless this Global Security is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company (55 Water Street, New York, New York), to the trustee for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co.  or such other name as requested by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company and any payment is made to Cede & Co., any transfer, pledge or other use hereof for value or otherwise by or to any Person is wrongful since the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein" or such other legend as may be required by the rules and regulations of the Depository.
 
(b)           Notwithstanding any other provision of Section 2.6 hereof or of this Section 2.13, unless the terms of a Global Security expressly permit such Global Security to be exchanged in whole or in part for individual Securities, a Global Security may be transferred, in whole but not in part, only as described in the legend thereto.
 
(c)           (i) If at any time the Depository for a Global Security notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for such Global Security or if at any time the Depository for the Global Security shall no longer be eligible or in good standing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other applicable statute or regulation, the Company shall appoint a successor Depository with respect to such Global Security.  If a successor Depository for such Global Security is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company's election pursuant to Section 2.5(c)(vii) hereof shall no longer be effective with respect to the series of Securities evidenced by such Global Security and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of individual Securities of such series in exchange for such Global Security, shall authenticate and deliver, individual Securities of such series of like tenor and terms in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security in exchange for such Global Security.

In the case of any insolvency, receivership, conservatorship, reorganization, readjustment of debt, marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings or any liquidation or winding-up of or relating to the Company as a whole, whether voluntary or involuntary, all obligations of the Company to holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled to be paid in full before any payment shall be made on account of the principal of or interest on any of the Securities.

.  In the event and during the continuation of any default in the payment of principal of or interest on any Senior Indebtedness, or in the event that any event of default with respect to any Senior Indebtedness shall have occurred and be continuing and shall have resulted in such Senior Indebtedness becoming or being declared due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise have become due and payable, unless and until such event of default shall have been cured, waived or remedied or shall have ceased to exist and such acceleration shall have been rescinded or annulled or all amounts due on such Senior Indebtedness are paid in full in cash or other permitted consideration, or in the event any judicial proceeding shall be pending with respect to any such default in payment or such event or default (unless and until all amounts due on such Senior Indebtedness are paid in full in cash or other permitted consideration), then no payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, properties or securities shall be made by the Company on account of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest (including any Additional Interest) if any, on the Securities or on account of the purchase or other acquisition of Securities by the Company or any subsidiary.

XCEL ENERGY INC. (Incorporated under the laws of the State of Minnesota)
 
 
 
XCEL ENERGY INC., a corporation of the State of Minnesota (the "Company"), for value received hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co.  or registered assigns, the principal sum of [                          ] DOLLARS on the Maturity Date set forth above, and to pay interest thereon from the Original Issue Date (or if this Global Security has two or more Original Issue Dates, interest shall, beginning on each such Original Issue Date, begin to accrue for that part of the principal amount to which that Original Issue Date is applicable) set forth above or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semiannually in arrears on the [                          ] and [                          ] in each year, commencing on the first such Interest Payment Date succeeding the applicable Original Issue Date set forth above, at the per annum Interest Rate set forth above, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment.  No interest shall accrue on the Maturity Date, so long as the principal amount of this Global Security is paid on the Maturity Date.  The interest so payable and punctually paid or duly provided for on any such Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the [                          ] or [                          ], as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date; provided, that the first Interest Payment Date for any part of this Security, the Original Issue Date of which is after a Regular Record Date but prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date, shall be the Interest Payment Date following the next succeeding Regular Record Date; and provided, that interest payable on the Maturity Date set forth above or, if applicable, upon redemption or acceleration, shall be payable to the Person to whom principal shall be payable.  Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture (as defined below), any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and shall be paid to the Person in whose name this Security is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Securityholders not more than fifteen days or fewer than ten days prior to such Special Record Date.  On or before Noon, New York
City time, or such other time as shall be agreed upon between the Trustee and the Depository, of the day on which such payment of interest is due on this Global Security (other than maturity), the Trustee shall pay to the Depository such interest in same day funds.  On or before Noon, New York City time, or such other time as shall be agreed upon between the Trustee and the Depository, of the day on which principal, interest payable at maturity and premium, if any, is due on this Global Security and following receipt of the necessary funds from the Company, the Trustee shall deposit with the Depository the amount equal to the principal, interest payable at maturity and premium, if any, by wire transfer into the account specified by the Depository.  As a condition to the payment, on the Maturity Date or upon redemption or acceleration, of any part of the principal and applicable premium of this Global Security, the Depository shall surrender, or cause to be surrendered, this Global Security to the Trustee, whereupon a new Global Security shall be issued to the Depository.
 
This Global Security is a global security in respect of a duly authorized issue of Junior Subordinated Notes, Series due [                          ] (the "Securities of this Series," which term includes any Global Securities representing such Securities) of the Company issued and to be issued under a Junior Subordinated Indenture dated as of [                          ] between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture) and indentures supplemental thereto (collectively, the "Indenture").  Under the Indenture, one or more series of Securities may be issued and, as used herein, the term "Securities" refers to the Securities of this Series and any other outstanding series of Securities.  The indebtedness of the Company evidenced by this Global Security, including the principal hereof and interest hereon, is, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture, subordinate and junior in right of payment to the Company's obligations to holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and each Holder of this Global Security, by acceptance hereof, agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions of the Indenture and all other provisions of the Indenture.  Reference is hereby made for a more complete statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities under the Indenture of the Company, the Trustee and the Securityholders and of the terms upon which the Securities are and are to be authenticated and delivered.  This Global Security has been issued in respect of the series designated on the first page hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount to $[                          ].
 
Each Security of this Series shall be dated and issued as of the date of its authentication by the Trustee and shall bear an Original Issue Date or Dates.  Each Security or Global Security issued upon transfer, exchange or substitution of such Security or Global Security shall bear the Original Issue Date or Dates of such transferred, exchanged or substituted Security or Global Security, as the case may be.
 
[Insert redemption provisions, if applicable]
 
[Notice of redemption will be given by mail to Holders of Securities of this Series not less than 30 or more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption, all as provided in the Indenture.  In the event of redemption of this Global Security in part only, a new Global Security or Securities of like tenor and series for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Securityholder hereof upon the surrender hereof.]
 
Interest payments for this Global Security shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  In any case where any Interest Payment Date or date on which the principal of this Global Security is required to be paid is not a Business Day, then payment of principal, premium or interest need not be made on such date but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Interest Payment Date or date on which the principal of this Global Security is required to be paid and, in the case of timely payment thereof, no interest shall accrue for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or the date on which the principal of this Global Security is required to be paid.
 
The Company, at its option, and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the Indenture, will be discharged from any and all obligations in respect of the Securities of this Series (except for certain obligations including obligations to register the transfer or exchange of Securities, replace stolen, lost or mutilated Securities, maintain paying agencies and hold monies for payment in trust, all as set forth in the Indenture) if the Company deposits with the Trustee money, U.S. Government Obligations which through the payment of interest thereon and principal thereof in accordance with their terms will provide money, or a combination of money and U.S. Government Obligations, in any event in an amount sufficient, without reinvestment, to pay all the principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities on the dates such payments are due in accordance with the terms of the Securities of this Series.
If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this Series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modifications of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Securityholders under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Global Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Global Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon the Security.
 
As set forth in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any Securities will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to such Securities, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities affected by such Event of Default shall have made written request and offered reasonable indemnity to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as Trustee and the Trustee shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; , that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of and any premium or interest on this Security on or after the respective due dates expressed here.
provided, however
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and to provisions of this Global Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Global Security at the times, places and rates and the coin or currency prescribed in the Indenture.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Global Security may be transferred only as permitted by the legend hereto.
 
If at any time the Depository for this Global Security notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for this Global Security or if at any time the Depository for this Global Security shall no longer be eligible or in good standing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other applicable statute or regulation, the Company shall appoint a successor Depository with respect to this Global Security.  If a successor Depository for this Global Security is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company's election to issue this Security in global form shall no longer be effective with respect to this Global Security and the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of individual Securities of this Series in exchange for this Global Security, will authenticate and deliver individual Securities of this Series of like tenor and terms in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of this Global Security.
 
The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that all Securities of this Series (but not less than all) issued or issuable in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Security or Securities.  In such event, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of individual Securities of this Series in exchange for such Global Security, shall authenticate and deliver, individual Securities of this Series of like tenor and terms in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Global Security or Securities in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
 
Under certain circumstances specified in the Indenture, the Depository may be required to surrender any two or more Global Securities which have identical terms (but which may have differing Original Issue Dates) to the Trustee, and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to, or at the direction of, the Depository a Global Security in principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of, and with all terms identical to, the Global Securities surrendered thereto and that shall indicate all Original Issue Dates and the principal amount applicable to each such Original Issue Date.
 
The Indenture and the Securities shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Minnesota.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee, directly or through an Authenticating Agent by manual signature of an authorized officer, this Global Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
All terms used in this Global Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture unless otherwise indicated herein.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.

7.60% JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES, SERIES DUE 2068
 
  There shall be a series of Securities designated the "7.60% Junior Subordinated Notes, Series due 2068" (the "Notes due 2068"). The Notes due 2068 shall be limited to $400,000,000  aggregate principal amount except as provided in Section 2.08 hereof.
SECTION 2.01

SECTION 2.02
 
  The Notes due 2068 shall be dated their date of authentication as provided in the Indenture.
SECTION 2.03
 
The Notes due 2068 shall bear interest at the rate of 7.60% per annum (the "Interest Rate") up to, but not including, the Stated Maturity or earlier Redemption Date (as defined below), and shall bear interest on any overdue principal at the Interest Rate and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under the applicable law) on any overdue or deferred installment of interest at the Interest Rate, compounded quarterly, payable (subject to the right of the Company to defer interest payments as described below) quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing April 1, 2008 to the Person in whose name such Note due 2068 is registered at the close of business on the Record Date (as defined below) next preceding such Interest Payment Date.
 
The term "Interest Period" shall mean each period from, and including, an Interest Payment Date to, but excluding, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, except that the first Interest Period shall commence on the date of original issuance of the Notes due 2068.
 
The amount of interest payable for any quarterly Interest Period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months (and for any period shorter than a full quarterly period, on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed during such period using 30-day calendar months).  If an Interest Payment Date or a Redemption Date (as defined below) falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of interest and principal shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date, as applicable.

"Redemption Date" means the date fixed for such redemption by or pursuant to this Supplemental Indenture.
 
The Company shall have the right, at any time and from time to time during the term of the Notes due 2068, to defer the payment of all or part of the current and accrued interest for a period not exceeding 10 consecutive years (each period, commencing on the date that the first such payment would otherwise be made, an "Optional Deferral Period"); provided that no Optional Deferral Period shall extend beyond the Stated Maturity of the Notes due 2068.  During an Optional Deferral Period, interest (calculated for each Interest Period in the manner provided herein, as if the interest payment had not been so deferred) shall be compounded quarterly.  Any deferred interest on the Notes
 
due 2068 shall accrue interest at a rate equal to the Interest Rate on the Notes due 2068 to the extent permitted by applicable law.  At the end of the Optional Deferral Period, the Company shall pay all interest accrued and unpaid (together with interest thereon) to the person in whose name the Notes due 2068 are registered at the close of business on the Record Date for the Interest Payment Date on which such Optional Deferral Period ended; provided that any such accrued and unpaid interest payable at the Stated Maturity or any Redemption Date shall be paid to the person to whom principal is payable.

Upon the termination of any such Optional Deferral Period and the payment of all amounts then due, including interest on deferred interest payments, the Company may elect to begin a new Optional Deferral Period, subject to the above requirements.  No interest shall be due and payable during an Optional Deferral Period, except at the end thereof.  The Company shall give the Trustee written notice of its election of an Optional Deferral Period at least 10 days and not more than 60 days before the applicable Interest Payment Date.  The Trustee shall promptly forward notice of such election to each Holder of record of the Notes due 2068.
 
Principal and interest shall be payable to the persons and in the manner provided in Sections 2.4 and 2.12 of the Indenture.
 
The Notes due 2068 shall be payable at the corporate trust office of the Trustee at the offices of such paying agents as the Company may appoint by Company Order in the future.

The Company may redeem the Notes due 2068 at any time before January 16, 2013, in whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption price equal to the Make-Whole Amount (as defined below), plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the Redemption Date.

"Treasury Yield" means, for any Redemption Date, (i) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after such time period, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Treasury Yield shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight-line basis, rounding to the nearest month) or (ii) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the quarterly equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its
 
principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.  The Treasury Yield shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the U.S. Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the time period from the Redemption Date to January 16, 2013 that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities with a term to maturity comparable to such time period.  If no U.S. Treasury security has a maturity which is within a period from three months before to three months after January 16, 2013, the two most closely corresponding U.S. Treasury securities shall be used as the Comparable Treasury Issue, and the Treasury Yield (as defined below) shall be interpolated or extrapolated on a straight-line basis, rounding to the nearest month using such securities.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (i) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, or (ii) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations received for such Redemption Date.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means any of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. or their respective successors or, if such firms or their successors are unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
 
"Make-Whole Amount" means an amount equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes due 2068 being redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes due 2068 being redeemed from the Redemption Date to January 16, 2013 (assuming, solely for the purposes of this calculation, that the principal amount of the Notes due 2068 to be redeemed was payable on January 16, 2013 and not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the Redemption Date), discounted to the Redemption Date on a quarterly basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a discount rate equal to the Treasury Yield plus 50 basis points.
 
"Rating Agency Event" means a change by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that publishes a rating for the Company as of January 11, 2008 (and any successor nationally recognized statistical rating organization) in the equity credit criteria for securities such as the Notes due 2068 resulting in a lower equity credit to the Company, as certified in an Officer's Certificate to the Trustee by the Company, than the equity credit assigned by such rating agency to the Notes due 2068 on January 11, 2008.
 
"Rating Agency Event Make-Whole Amount" means an amount equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes due 2068 being redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Notes due 2068 from the Redemption Date to January 16, 2013 (assuming, solely for the purposes of this calculation, that the principal amount of the Notes due 2068 to be redeemed was payable on January 16, 2013 and not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the Redemption Date), discounted to the Redemption Date on a quarterly basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a discount rate equal to the Treasury Yield plus 50 basis points.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means (i) Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. or any other primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer") designated by, and not affiliated with, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and  their respective successors, provided, however, that if Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. or their respective designees cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company will appoint another Primary Treasury Dealer as a substitute and (ii) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Company after consultation with the Independent Investment Banker.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, for each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
 
"Tax Event" means the receipt by the Company of an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that, as a result of (i) amendment to or change in the laws or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority of or in the United States that is enacted or issued or becomes effective after January 11, 2008; (ii) proposed change in those laws or regulations that is announced after January 11, 2008; (iii) official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws or regulations that is announced after January 11, 2008; or (iv) threatened challenge asserted in writing in connection with an audit of the Company or its subsidiaries, or a threatened challenge asserted in writing against any other taxpayer that has raised capital through the issuance of securities that are substantially similar to the Notes due 2068, which amendment, clarification, or change is effective, or which administrative action is taken or which judicial decision, interpretation or pronouncement is issued, in each case after January 11, 2008, there is more than an insubstantial risk that interest payable by the Company on the Notes due 2068 is not deductible, or within 90 days would not be deductible, in whole or in part, by the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
Promptly after the calculation of the redemption price of the Notes due 2068, the Company shall give the Trustee notice thereof and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for any such calculation.
 
The Notes due 2068 shall be redeemable in minimum denominations of $25.00.

Any such additional Notes due 2068, together with the other Notes due 2068, shall constitute a single series for purposes of the Indenture.
SECTION 2.08

The foregoing provisions shall not prevent or restrict the Company from making, and the Company shall be permitted at any time, including during an Optional Deferral Period, to make any of the following: (i) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of the Company's Capital Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors, agents, consultants or a stock purchase, dividend reinvestment or similar plan, or the satisfaction of the Company's obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred requiring the Company to purchase, redeem or acquire its Capital Stock; (ii) any payment, repayment, redemption, purchase, acquisition or declaration of a dividend as a result of any reclassification of the Company's Capital Stock or the exchange or conversion of all or a portion of one class or series of its Capital Stock or debt securities for a class or series of its Capital Stock; (iii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company's Capital Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of its Capital Stock or the security

XCEL ENERGY INC., a corporation of the State of Minnesota (the "Company"), for value received hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co. or registered assigns, the principal sum of FOUR  HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS on the Maturity Date set forth above (the "Stated Maturity"), and to pay interest thereon from the Original Issue Date (or if this Global Security has two or more Original Issue Dates, interest shall, beginning on each such Original Issue Date, begin to accrue for that part of the principal amount to which that Original Issue Date is applicable) set forth above or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, payable (subject to the right of the Company to defer interest payments as described below) quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date") commencing on April 1, 2008, at the per annum Interest Rate set forth above, and shall bear interest on any overdue principal at the Interest Rate and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue or deferred installment of interest at the Interest Rate, compounded quarterly, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment.  Interest so payable and punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name such Security of this Series is registered at the close of business on the Record Date (as defined below) next preceding such Interest Payment Date.
The term "Interest Period" shall mean each period from, and including, an Interest Payment Date to, but excluding, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, except that the first Interest Period shall commence on the date of original issuance of the Securities of this Series.
 
The amount of interest payable for any quarterly Interest Period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months (and for any period shorter than a full quarterly period, on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed during such period using 30-day calendar months).  If an Interest Payment Date or a Redemption Date (as defined below) falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of interest and principal shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date, as applicable.
 
"Business Day" means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday that is not a day on which banking institutions or trust companies in the Borough of Manhattan, the City and State of New York, or in the city where the corporate trust office of the Trustee is located, are obligated or authorized by law or executive order to close.
 
The "Record Date" for payment of interest will be the Business Day next preceding the Interest Payment Date, unless any such Securities of this Series are registered to a Holder other than the Depository or a nominee of the Depository, in which case the Record Date for payment of interest will be the fifteenth calendar day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date, whether or not a Business Day.
 
"Redemption Date" means the date fixed for such redemption by or pursuant to the provisions hereof.
 
The Company shall have the right, at any time and from time to time during the term of the Securities of this Series, to defer the payment of all or part of the current and accrued interest for a period not exceeding 10 consecutive years (each period, commencing on the date that the first such payment would otherwise be made, an "Optional Deferral Period"); provided that no Optional Deferral Period shall extend beyond the Stated Maturity of the Securities of this Series.  During an Optional Deferral Period, interest (calculated for each Interest Period in the manner provided herein, as if the interest payment had not been so deferred) shall be compounded quarterly.  Any deferred interest on the Securities of this Series shall accrue interest at a rate equal to the Interest Rate of the Securities of this Series, to the extent permitted by applicable law.  At the end of the Optional Deferral Period, the Company shall pay all interest accrued and unpaid (together with interest thereon) to the person in whose name the Securities of this Series are registered at the close of business on the Record Date for the Interest Payment Date on which such Optional Deferral Period ended; provided that any such accrued and unpaid interest payable at the Stated Maturity or any Redemption Date shall be paid to the person to whom principal is payable.
 
Prior to the termination of any such Optional Deferral Period, the Company may further defer the payment of interest, provided that such Optional Deferral Period together with all such previous and further deferrals of interest payments shall not exceed 10 consecutive years at any one time or extend beyond the Stated Maturity of the Securities of this Series.  Upon the termination of any such Optional Deferral Period and the payment of all amounts then due, including interest on deferred interest payments, the Company may elect to begin a new Optional Deferral Period, subject to the above requirements.  No interest shall be due and payable during an Optional Deferral Period, except at the end thereof.  The Company shall give the Trustee written notice of its election of an Optional Deferral Period at least 10 days and not more than 60 days before the applicable Interest Payment Date.  The Trustee shall promptly forward notice of such election to each Holder of record of the Securities of this Series.
 
Principal and interest shall be payable to the persons and in the manner provided in Sections 2.4 and 2.12 of the Indenture (as defined below).

Under the Indenture, one or more series of Securities may be issued and, as used herein, the term
"Securities" refers to the Securities of this Series and any other outstanding series of Securities.  The indebtedness of the Company evidenced by this Global Security, including the principal hereof and interest hereon, is, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture, subordinate and junior in right of payment to the Company's obligations to holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and each Holder of this Global Security, by acceptance hereof, agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions of the Indenture and all other provisions of the Indenture.  Reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a more complete statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities under the Indenture of the Company, the Trustee and the Securityholders and of the terms upon which the Securities of this Series are and are to be authenticated and delivered.  This Global Security has been issued in respect of the series designated on the first page hereof.
 
Each Security of this Series shall be dated and issued as of the date of its authentication by the Trustee and shall bear an Original Issue Date or Dates.  Each Security or Global Security issued upon transfer, exchange or substitution of such Security or Global Security shall bear the Original Issue Date or Dates of such transferred, exchanged or substituted Security or Global Security, as the case may be.

The Company may redeem the Securities of this Series at any time on or after January 16, 2013, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the Redemption Date.

"Comparable Treasury Issue" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the U.S. Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the time period from the Redemption Date to January 16, 2013 that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities with a term to maturity comparable to such time period.  If no U.S. Treasury security has a maturity which is within a period from three months before to three months after January 16, 2013, the two most closely corresponding U.S. Treasury securities shall be used as the Comparable Treasury Issue, and the Treasury
Yield (as defined below) shall be interpolated or extrapolated on a straight-line basis, rounding to the nearest month using such securities.

"Rating Agency Event" means a change by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that publishes a rating for the Company as of January 11, 2008 (and any successor nationally recognized statistical rating organization) in the equity credit criteria for securities such as the Securities of this Series resulting in a lower equity credit to the Company, as certified in an Officer's Certificate to the Trustee by the Company, than the equity credit assigned by such rating agency to the Securities of this Series on January 11, 2008.
 
"Rating Agency Event Make-Whole Amount" means an amount equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities of this Series being redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Securities of this Series from the Redemption Date to January 16, 2013 (assuming, solely for the purposes of this calculation, that the principal amount of the Securities of this Series to be redeemed was payable on January 16, 2013 and not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the Redemption Date), discounted to the Redemption Date on a quarterly basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a discount rate equal to the Treasury Yield plus 50 basis points.

"Tax Event" means the receipt by the Company of an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that, as a result of (i) amendment to or change in the laws or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority of or in the United States that is enacted or issued or becomes effective after January 11, 2008; (ii) proposed change in those laws or regulations that is announced after January 11, 2008; (iii) official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws or regulations that is announced after January 11, 2008; or (iv) threatened challenge asserted in writing in connection with an audit of the Company or its subsidiaries, or a threatened challenge asserted in writing against any other taxpayer that has raised capital through the issuance of securities that are substantially similar to the Securities of this Series, which amendment, clarification, or change is effective, or which Administrative Action is taken or which judicial decision, interpretation or pronouncement is issued, in each case after January 11, 2008, there is more than an insubstantial risk that interest payable by the Company on the Securities of this Series is not deductible, or within 90 days would not be deductible, in whole or in part, by the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Global Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Global Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon the Security.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and to provisions of this Global Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Global Security at the times, places and rates and the coin or currency prescribed in the Indenture.

The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that all Securities of this Series (but not less than all) issued or issuable in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Security or Securities.

(c)           For purposes of Sections 4(a) and 4(b), the Holders whose consent or agreement is required to terminate, amend or supplement this Replacement Capital Covenant or the obligations of the Corporation hereunder shall be the Holders of the then-effective Covered Debt as of a record date established by the Corporation that is not more than 30 days prior to the date on which the Corporation proposes that such termination, amendment or supplement becomes effective.

For purposes of this definition of Mandatory Trigger Provision, (1) the issuer will not be obligated to issue (or use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to issue) any such APM Qualifying Securities for so long as a Market Disruption Event has occurred and is continuing; (2) if, due to a Market Disruption Event or otherwise, the issuer is able to raise and apply some, but not all, of the eligible proceeds necessary to pay all deferred Distributions on any Distribution Date, the issuer will apply any available eligible proceeds to pay accrued and unpaid Distributions on the applicable Distribution Date in chronological order subject to the Common Cap, the Preferred Cap and the Share Cap (if any), as applicable; and (3) if the issuer has outstanding more than one class or series of securities under which it is obligated to sell a type of any such APM Qualifying Securities and applies some part of the proceeds to the payment of deferred Distributions, then on any date and for any period the amount of net proceeds received by the issuer from those sales and available for payment of deferred Distributions on such securities shall be applied to such securities on a pro rata basis up to the Common Cap, the Preferred Cap and the Share Cap (if any), as applicable, in proportion to the total amounts that are due on such securities.  No remedy other than Permitted Remedies will arise by the terms of such securities or related transaction agreements in favor of the holders of such securities as a result of the issuer's failure to pay Distributions because of the Mandatory Trigger Provision or as a result of the issuer's exercise of its right under an Optional Deferral Provision until Distributions have been deferred for one or more Distribution Periods that total together at least ten years.

Based on the foregoing and the assumptions that follow, I am of the opinion that the Securities, when they are executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the Indenture and issued and delivered to the Underwriters against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company.

I express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of Minnesota.  The opinions herein expressed are limited to the specific issues addressed and to laws existing on the date hereof.  By rendering this opinion, I do not undertake to advise you with respect to any other matter or of any change in such laws or in the interpretation thereof which may occur after the date hereof.
