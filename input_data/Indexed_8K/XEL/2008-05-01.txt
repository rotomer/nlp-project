MINNEAPOLIS  Xcel Energy Inc. (NYSE: XEL) today reported first quarter 2008 GAAP earnings of $153 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared with $120 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in 2007. Ongoing earnings, adjusted for certain non-recurring items, were $0.35 per diluted share, compared with $0.27 in 2007.
 
Higher first quarter 2008 earnings were primarily attributable to higher electric and natural gas margins, reflecting various rate increases, weather-normalized retail sales growth, higher rider recovery, the impact of favorable temperatures and leap year, which increased sales.  Partially offsetting these positive factors were higher operating and maintenance expense and increased depreciation expense.
 
"Our solid first quarter results reflect the continued execution of our strategy," said Richard C. Kelly, chairman, president and chief executive officer.  "During the current quarter, we continued to pursue numerous regulatory initiatives to assure that we are well positioned to meet our environmental and financial objectives. Further, we are unique among utilities by proposing plans to meet our customers' growing demand for energy, while at the same time reducing carbon emissions.  With a good start to the year, we are reaffirming our 2008 earnings from continuing operations guidance range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share."
 
Earnings Adjusted for Certain Non-recurring Items (Ongoing Earnings-Note 6)
 
During 2007, Xcel Energy resolved a dispute with the IRS regarding its Corporate Owned Life Insurance (COLI) program.  Excluding the impact of the COLI program, Xcel Energy's ongoing first quarter 2008 earnings were $155 million, or $0.35 per share, compared with first quarter 2007 ongoing earnings of $114 million or $0.27 per share.  The following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP earnings per share to ongoing earnings per share for 2008 and 2007.
 
At 10 a.m. CDT today, Xcel Energy will host a conference call to review first quarter financial results.  To participate in the call, please dial in five to 10 minutes prior to the start and follow the operator's instructions.

Note 1.  Earnings per Share Summary
 
The following table summarizes the diluted earnings per share contributions of Xcel Energy's businesses:
 
 
The following table summarizes significant components contributing to the changes in the first quarter of 2008 diluted earnings per share compared with the same period in 2007, which are discussed in more detail later in the release.
 
Note 2.  Regulated Utility Results  Continuing Operations
 
The following table summarizes the estimated impact of temperature variations on utility results included in continuing operations, compared with sales under normal weather conditions.
Estimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings
 
 
 The following table summarizes Xcel Energy's regulated utility growth from continuing operations for actual and weather-normalized energy sales for the three-month period and the weather-normalized
Sales Growth
energy sales for the three-month period without leap day ended March 31, 2008, compared with the same period in 2007.
 
The following table details the revenues and margin for base electric utility, short-term wholesale and commodity trading activities that are included in continuing operations:
Base Electric Utility, Short-term Wholesale and
Commodity Trading Margins
 
Note  The short-term wholesale and commodity trading results in the above table reflect the estimated impacts of the regulatory sharing of certain margins.
 
Base Electric Utility Margin
 
 
Natural Gas Utility Margins
-The following table details the changes in natural gas utility revenues and margin. The cost of natural gas tends to vary with changing sales requirements and the unit cost of natural gas purchases. However, due to purchased natural gas cost recovery mechanisms for sales to retail customers, fluctuations in the cost of natural gas have little effect on natural gas margin.
 
The following table summarizes the components of the changes in natural gas margin for the three months ended March 31:
 
Natural Gas Margin
 
 
Other Operating and Maintenance Expenses
 Other operating and maintenance expenses for the first quarter of 2008 increased by approximately $15 million, or 3.3 percent, compared with the same period in 2007.  For more information see the following table:
 
 
Improved employee health care experience and a change to a high deductible health care plan, as well as lower current period performance based incentive plan expense were the primary factors contributing to the lower employee benefit costs.  The higher combustion/hydro plant costs were primarily attributable to normally scheduled and unplanned maintenance.
 
Depreciation and amortization
 Depreciation and amortization expense in
creased by approximately $6 million, or 2.8 percent, for the first quarter of 2008, compared with the same period in 2007. 
The increase is primarily due to normal system expansion, which was partially offset by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission approval of
 
Northern States Power Co. (NSP)-Minnesota's remaining lives depreciation filing in the third quarter of 2007.  This decision reduced third quarter depreciation retroactive to Jan. 1, 2007; however, it did not impact first quarter 2007 depreciation expense due to receipt of the approval in the third quarter of 2007.
 
Interest and other income, net
 
Interest and other income increased by $8 million for the first quarter of 2008, compared with the same period in 2007.  The increase is primarily the result of PSRI terminating the COLI program in 2007.
 
Income taxes
 Income taxes for continuing operations increased by $29 million for the first quarter of 2008, compared with 2007.  The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to an increase in pretax income. The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 33.2 percent for the first quarter of 2008, compared with 28.8 percent for the same period in 2007.  The higher effective tax rate for first quarter 2008 was primarily due to an increase in the forecasted annual effective tax rate for 2008, compared with 2007, largely as a result of PSRI terminating the COLI program in 2007.
 
Note 3. Xcel Energy Capital Structure and Financing
 
Following is the preliminary capital structure of Xcel Energy at March 31, 2008:
 
 
In January 2008, Xcel Energy issued $400 million of junior subordinated notes due in 2068 with an interest rate of 7.6 percent.  The proceeds were used to
repay short-term debt.
 
In March 2008, NSP-Minnesota issued $500 million of first mortgage bonds with an interest rate of 5.25 percent and a 10-year maturity.  The proceeds were used to
repay short-term debt and for general corporate purposes.
 
During 2008, Xcel Energy plans to issue debt securities to refinance retiring maturities, reduce short-term debt, fund construction programs and for other general corporate purposes. Current debt financing plans include the following:
 
 
These financing plans are subject to change, depending on capital expenditures, internal cash generation, market conditions and other factors.
 
Note 4.  Rates and Regulation
 
New Mexico electric rate case -
On July 30, 2007, SPS filed a request for a retail electric general rate increase of $17.3 million annually, or 6.6 percent, with the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC). The rate filing is based on a 2006 historic test year adjusted for known and measurable changes and includes a requested return on equity (ROE) of 11.0 percent, an electric rate base of approximately $307.3 million and an equity ratio of 51.2 percent.
 
Following is a summary of intervenor and NMPRC staff testimony, which was filed on March 6, 2008:
 
      NMPRC staff recommended an increase of approximately $8 million based on a 9.1 percent ROE and other adjustments.
 
      The attorney general recommended a $2 million rate decrease based on a 9.2 percent ROE and other adjustments.
 
      Occidental Permian, a large retail customer, recommended a 9.9 percent ROE.
 
Hearings were held in April 2008.  At the close of the hearings, the parties agreed to move consideration of the Lea Power Partners rider costs to a future rate proceeding to be initiated by Xcel Energy this summer, which will be accompanied with a request for interim relief, so that issues associated with lease accounting and potential contract restructuring may be adequately addressed.  The remaining procedural schedule is as follows:
 
 
NSP  Minnesota - North Dakota electric rate case filing
-
On Dec. 7, 2007, NSP-Minnesota filed with the North Dakota Public Service Commission (NDPSC), a request to increase electric rates by $20.5 million, representing an overall increase of 14 percent.  The request is based on a common equity ratio of 51.77 percent, a ROE of 11.5 percent and a rate base of approximately $242 million.   Interim rates of $17.2 million were effective on Feb. 5, 2008.
 
NSP-Minnesota and the NDPSC staff reached a stipulation in which both parties recommended an ROE of 10.75 percent, with a sharing mechanism for earnings above 10.75 percent.  This stipulation is subject to approval by the NDPSC.  Final rates are expected to be effective in the fall of 2008.  The procedural schedule is as follows:
 
 
PSCo wholesale rate case -
In February 2008, PSCo requested a $12.5 million increase, or a 5.88 percent in wholesale rates, based on 11.5 percent requested ROE.  The $12.5 million total increase was composed of  $8.8 million of traditional base rate recovery and $3.7 million of construction work in progress (CWIP) recovery for the Comanche 3 and Fort St. Vrain projects. 
The increase is applicable to all wholesale firm service customers with the exception of Intermountain Rural Electric Cooperative, which is under a rate moratorium until January 2009.
 
In March 2008, PSCo reached an agreement with Holy Cross, Yampa Valley and Grand Valley (REA's), which will resolve all issues based on a "black box" settlement with an implied ROE of 10.4 percent.  Parties filed the settlement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on April 17, 2008, with rates effective May 1, 2008. 
PSCo has reached an agreement with the
cities of Burlington and Center, as well as Aquila
under the same substantive terms and conditions as the REA settlement, which was filed with FERC on April 25, 2008.  The settlements provide for:
 
     
The ability to implement rates in our next general rate case that will involve Comanche 3 costs upon a nominal suspension.
 
SPS wholesale complaint case
-
On April 21, 2008, the FERC issued an order approving the settlement agreement with Golden Spread Electric Cooperative filed in December 2007 and a separate order that resolved base rate issues for the period Jan 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006 as well as certain fuel clause adjustment (FCAC) issues.  Related to the base rate issues, the FERC established new rates that were approximately $6.9 million less for this 18-month period, than the then currently effective rates based upon a 9.33 percent ROE.  Regarding the fuel clause, t
he FERC determined that the method for calculating fuel and purchased energy cost charges to the complaining customers is to deduct from such costs incremental fuel and purchased energy costs, which it is attributing to SPS' market-based intersystem sales on the basis that these are "opportunity" sales under its precedent.  The FERC ordered that refunds of fuel cost charges based on this method of determining the FCAC should begin as of Jan. 1, 2005 (the refund effective date in the case).  The FERC ordered SPS to file a compliance filing calculating its refund obligation within 30 days of the date of the order and implement the instructions in the order in calculating its FCAC charges going forward from that date.  While the order is subject to interpretation with respect to aspects of the calculation of the refund obligation, SPS does not expect its refund obligation to its full requirements customers from Jan. 1, 2005 through March 31, 2008, to exceed $11 million.  SPS is reviewing the order and has not yet determined whether to seek rehearing.  SPS has accrued an amount, sufficient to cover the refund obligation as of March 31, 2008.
 
SPS 2008 wholesale rate case -
On March 31, 2008, SPS filed a wholesale power base rate case in the full-requirements customers' base rates. SPS is seeking an annual revenue increase of $14.9 million or an overall 5.14 percent increase
, based on 12.20 percent requested ROE. 
A motion for dismissal and protest was filed by the four eastern New Mexico Cooperatives on April 21, 2008.  A FERC decision is expected later in 2008.
 
SPS formula transmission rate case 
In December 2007, SPS submitted an application to implement a transmission formula rate for the SPS zone of the Xcel Energy Open Access Transmission Tariff.  The proposed rates would be updated annually each July 1st based on SPS' prior year actual costs and loads plus the revenue requirements associated with projected current year transmission plant additions.  The proposed ROE on common equity is 12.7 percent, including a 50 basis point adder for SPS' participation in the SPP RTO, consistent with FERC precedent.  The proposed rates would provide first year incremental annual transmission revenue for SPS of approximately $5.5 million.
 
In February 2008, the FERC issued an order accepting the proposed rates, suspending the effective date to July 6, 2008, and setting the rate filing for hearings and settlement procedures.  The FERC granted a 50 basis point adder to the ROE on common equity that it will determine in this proceeding, as a result of SPS' participation in the SPP regional transmission organization.  In March 2008, the FERC accepted the companion SPP rate change filing subject to the outcome of the SPS rate filing.  The rate filings are now in settlement procedures.  The ultimate outcome of the rate filings is not known at this time.
 
Wisconsin electric fuel cost recovery
-
On April 7, 2008, we filed an application with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) for an electric fuel surcharge.  The forecast in the application shows NSP-Wisconsin will under-recover 2008 fuel costs by $19.7 million without a surcharge.  If the surcharge is approved as filed, we estimate it would recover approximately $12.8 million through December.

Note 6.  Non-GAAP Reconciliation
 
The following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP earnings to ongoing earnings:
 
 
As a result of the termination of the COLI program, Xcel Energy's management believes that ongoing earnings provide a more meaningful comparison of earnings results between different periods in which the COLI program was in place and is more representative of Xcel Energy's fundamental core earnings power.  Xcel Energy's management uses ongoing earnings internally for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the board of directors, in determining whether performance targets are met for performance-based compensation, and when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors.
