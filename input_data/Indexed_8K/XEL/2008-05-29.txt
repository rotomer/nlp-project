Item 8.01. Other Events
 
In December 2007, Northern States Power Company (NSP-Minnesota), a Minnesota Corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy, filed a request with the North Dakota Public Service Commission (NDPSC) to increase North Dakota retail electric rates by $20.5 million, or about 14 percent. The request was based on an 11.50 percent return on equity (ROE), an equity ratio of 51.77 percent, and a rate base of approximately $242 million.  Interim rates of $17.2 million became effective in February 2008.
 
NSP-Minnesota and the NDPSC staff reached a stipulation settlement in the rate case in which both parties recommended an ROE of 10.75 percent, with a sharing mechanism for earnings above 10.75 percent.  This stipulation settlement is subject to approval by the NDPSC.
 
On May 21, 2008, the NDPSC Staff filed direct testimony recommending an overall base rate decrease of $200,000.  The primary recommended disallowances include costs associated with plant investments resulting from Minnesota environmental mandates, refund to customers of non-legal asset retirement obligation funds, changes to plant lives used to establish depreciation rates and the impact of a stipulated 10.75 percent ROE.  The recommended impact to NSP-Minnesota is partially offset by $2.9 million as a result of moving wholesale margins and some Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator costs between fuel cost adjustment and base rates.  The remaining schedule is as follows:
 
                 
Rebuttal testimony June 13, 2008
                 
Evidentiary hearings June 23, 2008
                 
Order issued August 2008
 
New rates are expected to be effective Oct. 1, 2008.
