Other Events.
 
On Nov. 3, 2008, Northern States Power Company (NSP-Minnesota), a Minnesota Corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc., filed a request with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) for an overall increase in annual revenues of approximately $156.1 million, or an increase of 6.05 percent.  The rate filing is based on a 2009 calendar year budget and includes a requested rate of return on equity of 11.00 percent, an electric net rate base of approximately $4.062 billion allocated to the Minnesota retail jurisdiction, and an equity ratio of 52.47 percent.
 
As part of this rate filing, NSP-Minnesota proposes to implement interim electric rates effective Jan. 2, 2009. The interim rate increase is proposed in the amount of approximately $155.1 million.  The interim rates would remain in effect until the MPUC makes its final decision on the case. Final electric base rates will likely be put into place in late 2009.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
