Item 8.01. Other Events
 
On Nov. 3, 2008, Northern States Power Company (NSP-Minnesota), a Minnesota corporation, filed a request with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) to increase Minnesota electric rates by $156 million annually, or 6.05 percent.  The request is based on a 2009 forecast test year, an electric rate base of $4.1 billion, a requested return on equity (ROE) of 11.00 percent, and an equity ratio of 52.5 percent.
 
In December 2008, the MPUC approved an interim rate increase of $132 million, or 5.12 percent, effective Jan. 2, 2009.  The primary difference between interim rate levels approved and NSP-Minnesota's request of $156 million is due to a previously authorized ROE of 10.54 percent and NSP-Minnesota's requested ROE of 11.00 percent.
 
The Office of Energy Security (OES) recommended a revenue increase of $72 million, based on a ROE of 10.88 percent and an equity ratio of 52.5 percent.  In addition, the OES recommendation reflected the following adjustments:
On April 7, 2009, intervenors submitted direct testimony. 
 
Recognition of a 10 year life extension of the Prairie Island facility, resulting in a decrease of approximately $40 million in depreciation and decommissioning expenses and rejection of our proposed nuclear rate stability plan.  These adjustments reduce NSP-Minnesota's overall revenue deficiency while at the same time reducing expense accruals by $40 million.
     
An adjustment for increased sales, which reduced the request by $12.3 million, a $7 million reduction in short-term capacity expenses, a decrease in overall salaries of $4.8 million, and chemical commodity cost decreases of $1.6 million.
     
 
The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) recommended recognition of depreciation and decommissioning cost decreases resulting from the Prairie Island life extension in the current proceeding and rejection of the proposed nuclear rate stability plan.  However, the OAG did not recommend a specific reduction in revenue requirements.  The OAG also proposed a fuel clause adjustment (FCA) incentive through a 3 percent cap on base fuel costs and requested that any approved increase in rates be applied equally to all classes of customers.
 
Other parties to the proceeding (Large Customer Group, Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, Suburban Rate Authority, the Customer Group) addressed several non-revenue requirements issues, including FCA reporting and accountability, class cost of service and rate design, and potential changes to NSP-Minnesota's quality of service metrics.
 
A final decision from the MPUC is expected in the third quarter of 2009.  The following procedural schedule has been established:
 
NSP-Minnesota rebuttal testimony on May 5, 2009;
     
State agency and intervenor surrebuttal testimony on May 26, 2009; and
     
Evidentiary hearings are scheduled for June 2-9, 2009.
     
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
