Item 8.01. Other Events
 
In November 2008, Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo) filed a request with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to increase Colorado electric rates by $174.7 million annually, or approximately 7.4 percent.  The rate filing is based on a 2009 forecast test year, an electric rate base of $4.15 billion, a requested ROE of 11.0 percent and an equity ratio of 58.08 percent.  PSCo's request included a return of approximately $40 million for construction work in progress (CWIP) associated with incremental expenditures on the Comanche 3 unit since January 1, 2007 pursuant to the 2004 Colorado least cost plan settlement agreement (a return on expenditures prior to January 1, 2007 for Comanche 3 are included in existing rates).  Under the settlement agreement, PSCo does not record allowance for funds used during construction (AFDC) income for the months this return is actually received from customers.
 
In February 2009, parties filed answer testimony in the case.  The CPUC staff recommended an increase of $110 million based on a 10.3 percent ROE to be phased in with $70 million beginning in July and another $40 million in approximately January of 2010.  The Office of Consumer Council (OCC) recommended a $3 million increase based on a historic test year and a 9.75 percent ROE. 
 
In March 2009, PSCo filed rebuttal testimony and revised its rate increase request to $159 million to reflect updated data. 
 
On April 10, 2009, intervenors filed surrebuttal testimony.  The CPUC staff increased their revenue deficiency to $132.9 million based on an authorized ROE to 10.71 percent and an equity ratio of 58 percent.  The CPUC staff also recommended a phase-in of rates with $70 million effective July 2009 and the remainder to be effective in January 2010.  The OCC recommended an $11 million rate increase based on a historic year and an authorized ROE of 10 percent.
 
On April 22, 2009, a settlement agreement with CPUC staff, the Colorado Office of Consumer Counsel, Colorado Energy Consumers (an association of some of Public Service's larger commercial customers), CF&I Steel, LP d/b/a Rocky Mountain Steel Mills, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Sam's West, Inc., and Energy Outreach Colorado, was filed with the CPUC. 
 
The settlement provides for an overall $112.2 million increase in base rates, but does not provide for the specific resolution of many of the disputed issues such as return on equity and capital structure.  However, the settlement provides that incremental CWIP not included in existing rates for the Comanche Unit 3 is removed from rate base and that PSCo is allowed to continue to record AFDC income on this balance until the Comanche Unit 3 is placed into service.
 
Hearings on the settlement will begin on April 24, 2009 and a final decision is expected in the summer of 2009.  The settlement provides that parties support new rates to be effective on July 1, 2009.  The settlement agreement is included as exhibit 99.01.
