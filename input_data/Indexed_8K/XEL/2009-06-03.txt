On June 1, 2009, Northern States Power Company, a Wisconsin corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc, (NSP-Wisconsin) filed a combined electric and natural gas application with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) in accordance with the PSCW's established biennial rate filing schedule.  In the application, NSP-Wisconsin requested an overall increase in annual retail electric revenues of approximately $30.4 million, or an increase of 5.6 percent.  The rate filing is based on a 2010 calendar year budget, an electric net investment rate base of approximately $644 million, a regulatory equity ratio of 53.12 percent, and NSP-Wisconsin's currently authorized rate of return on equity of 10.75 percent.  NSP-Wisconsin did not request any change to natural gas rates.  NSP-Wisconsin's gas net investment rate base is approximately $81 million.  NSP-Wisconsin has requested the PSCW to issue an order approving this application in time to allow for new rates to be effective Jan. 1, 2010.
