Item 8.01. Other Events
 
On June 30, 2009, Northern States Power Company (NSP-Minnesota), a Minnesota corporation, and wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc., filed a request with the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission (SDPUC) to increase South Dakota electric rates by $18.6 million annually, or 12.7 percent.  This proposed increase includes approximately $2.9 million in revenues currently recovered through automatic recovery mechanisms.  Thus, the requested increase, net of current automatic recovery mechanisms, is approximately $15.7 million or 10.7 percent.  The request is based on a 2008 historic test year adjusted for known and measurable changes in rate base and operating and maintenance expenses, an electric rate base of $282 million, a requested return on equity of 11.25 percent, and an equity ratio of 51.63 percent.  Rates are expected to be in effect on or before Jan. 31, 2010, based on statutory requirements in South Dakota.
