Exhibit 99.01
 
 
414 Nicollet Mall
Minneapolis, MN 55401
 
Oct. 29, 2009
MINNEAPOLIS  Xcel Energy Inc. (NYSE: XEL) today reported third quarter 2009 earnings of $221 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, compared with $223 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, in 2008.
 
The decrease in third quarter 2009 earnings was primarily due to lower sales resulting from cooler temperatures in the third quarter of 2009, higher operating and maintenance expense and an increase in the effective tax rate.  Partially offsetting these factors was an increase in electric margins as a result of several constructive rate case outcomes including those in Minnesota, Colorado, Texas, New Mexico and Wisconsin.
 
"Lower sales resulting from unseasonably cool temperatures, as well as an increase in our overall effective tax rate reduced our earnings this quarter compared to last year," said Richard C. Kelly, chairman and chief executive officer.  "Throughout the year, we have acted to offset the impact of lower sales, due to both unfavorable temperatures and economic conditions, through various cost management initiatives.  Based on current projections, we expect 2009 earnings to be near the mid-point of our guidance range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share."
 
At 10 a.m. CDT today, Xcel Energy will host a conference call to review financial results.  To participate in the call, please dial in 5 to 10 minutes prior to the start and follow the operator's instructions.
 
 
The conference call also will be simultaneously broadcast and archived on Xcel Energy's website at www.xcelenergy.com.  To access the presentation, click on Investor Information.  If you are unable to participate in the live event, the call will be available for replay from 12:00 p.m. CDT on Oct. 29 through 11:59 p.m. CDT on Oct. 30.
 
Except for the historical statements contained in this release, the matters discussed herein, including our 2009 full year EPS guidance and assumptions, are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Such forward-looking statements are intended to be identified in this document by the words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "objective," "outlook," "plan," "project," "possible," "potential," "should" and similar expressions. Actual results may vary materially. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update them to reflect changes that occur after that date. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: general economic conditions, including the availability of credit and its impact on capital expenditures and the ability of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries to obtain financing on favorable terms; business conditions in the energy industry; actions of credit rating agencies; competitive factors, including the extent and timing of the entry of additional competition in the markets served by Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries; unusual weather; effects of geopolitical events, including war and acts of terrorism; state, federal and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives that affect cost and investment recovery, have an impact on rates or have an impact on asset operation or ownership; structures that affect the speed and degree to which competition enters the electric and natural gas markets; costs and other effects of legal and administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations and claims; actions of accounting regulatory bodies; and the other risk factors listed from time to time by Xcel Energy in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including Risk Factors in Item 1A and Exhibit 99.01 of Xcel Energy's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2008 and of Xcel Energy's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2009.
 
Due to the seasonality of Xcel Energy's operating results, quarterly financial results are not an appropriate base from which to project annual results.
 
Note 1.  Earnings per Share Summary
 
The following table summarizes the diluted earnings per share for Xcel Energy:
 
 
(a)
                    
Ongoing earnings exclude the impact related to the Corporate Owned Life Insurance (COLI) program. During 2007, Xcel Energy resolved a dispute with the IRS regarding its COLI program. The 2009 and 2008 earnings were not materially affected by the termination of the COLI program and the 2009 impact is primarily related to legal costs associated with company claims against the insurance provider and broker of the COLI policies.
 
PSCo
Earnings at PSCo were flat for the third quarter and decreased by five cents per share for the nine months ending Sept. 30, 2009, largely due to the negative impact of weather and rising costs.  The decrease was partially offset by new electric rates that went into effect in July 2009.  In May 2009, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approved an annual electric rate increase of $112 million.
 
NSP-Minnesota
Earnings at NSP-Minnesota decreased by five cents per share for the third quarter and by three cents per share for the nine months ending Sept. 30, 2009.  The decrease is mainly due to the negative impact of weather, an increase in the effective tax rate and timing of nuclear outage expenses.
  
The decrease was partially offset by an electric rate increase that went into effect in January 2009.
 
NSP-Wisconsin
Earnings at NSP-Wisconsin were flat for the third quarter and increased by one cent per share for the nine months ending Sept. 30, 2009, largely due to improved fuel recovery and new rates which were effective in January 2009.
 
SPS
Earnings at SPS increased by three cents per share for the third quarter and by eight cents per share for the nine months ending Sept. 30, 2009.  The increase was primarily due to electric rate increases in Texas (effective in February 2009) and New Mexico (effective in July 2009) and the 2008 resolution of certain fuel cost allocation issues, which were partially offset by higher purchased capacity costs.
 
WYCO
Equity earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries were flat for the third quarter and increased by one cent per share for the nine months ending Sept. 30, 2009, due to our investment in WYCO, which owns a natural gas pipeline in Colorado that began operations in late 2008 as well as a storage facility that commenced operations in July 2009.
The following table summarizes significant components contributing to the changes in the 2009 diluted earnings per share compared with the same periods in 2008, which are discussed in more detail later in the release.
 
 
(a)
                    
Ongoing earnings exclude the impact related to the COLI program. During 2007, Xcel Energy resolved a dispute with the IRS regarding its COLI program.The 2009 and 2008 earnings were not materially affected by the termination of the COLI program and the 2009 impact is primarily related to legal costs associated with company claims against the insurance provider and broker of the COLI policies.
 
Note 2.  Regulated Utility Results  Continuing Operations
 
Estimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings
The following table summarizes the estimated impact on earnings per share of temperature variations compared with sales under normal weather conditions.
 
 
Sales
The following table summarizes Xcel Energy's sales increases and decreases for actual and weather-normalized sales for 2009 compared with the same periods in 2008, excluding the impact of the 2008 leap year.
 
 
Electric
Electric revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses are largely impacted by the fluctuation  of  natural gas prices used in the generation of electricity, but has little impact on electric margin.  The following tables detail the electric revenues and margin:
 
 
The following table summarizes the components of the changes in electric margin:
 
 
Xcel Energy has experienced a decline in megawatt hours (MwH) sales, which we believe is driven by overall economic conditions and to a lesser degree, increased conservation efforts.  Our most significant declines have occurred in commercial and industrial sales, which are directly related to the economic downturn.  The declines in MwH sales to the commercial and industrial customer class are partially offset by demand fees, which mitigate to a certain degree the impact of the lower MwH sales.
 
Natural Gas
The cost of natural gas tends to vary with changing sales requirements and the cost of natural gas purchases. However, due to purchased natural gas cost recovery mechanisms for sales to retail customers, fluctuations in the cost of natural gas have little effect on natural gas margin. The following tables detail natural gas revenues and margin:
The following table summarizes the components of the changes in natural gas margin:
 
 
Other Operating and Maintenance (O&M) Expenses
 O&M expenses increased by approximately $43.9 million, or 10.4 percent, for the third quarter and approximately $70.4 million, or 5.3 percent for the first nine months of 2009, compared with 2008.  The following table summarizes the changes in other O&M expenses:
 
 
     
The increase in nuclear outage costs is due to the timing of outages in conjunction with the commissions' approval of the change in the nuclear refueling outage recovery method from the direct expense method to the deferral and amortization method in the third quarter of 2008.
     
Higher employee benefits costs are primarily attributable to increased pension costs, in part, related to market losses on retirement benefit plan assets as well as higher employee medical plan costs.
     
The increase in nuclear plant operation costs is driven primarily by an increase in security costs and regulatory fees, resulting from new Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirements.
     
Lower consulting costs are primarily the result of cost management initiatives implemented in early 2009.
 
Conservation and Demand Side Management (DSM) Program Expenses 
Conservation and DSM program expenses increased approximately $19.7 million for the third quarter of 2009, and by $41.5 million for the first nine months of 2009, compared with the same periods in 2008.  The higher expense is attributable to the expansion of programs and regulatory commitments.  Conservation and DSM program expenses are generally recovered through riders in our major jurisdictions or through base rates with tracker mechanisms.
 
Depreciation and Amortization 
Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by approximately $10.9 million, or 5.2 percent, for the third quarter of 2009, and by $13.2 million, or 2.1 percent, for the first nine months of 2009, compared with the same periods in 2008. In September 2009,
as a result of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) decision in the Minnesota electric rate case, NSP-Minnesota began recognizing a 10-year life extension of the Prairie Island nuclear plant for purposes of determining depreciation, effective Jan. 1, 2009. 
In addition, in June 2009, the MPUC extended the recovery period of decommissioning expense by 10 years for the Prairie Island and the Monticello nuclear plants.
These decreases were partially offset by normal system expansion.
 
Taxes (Other Than Income Taxes) 
Taxes (other than income taxes) increased by approximately $8.7 million, or 12.3 percent, for the third quarter of 2009, and by $10.8 million, or 5.0 percent, for the first nine months of 2009, compared with the same periods in 2008.  The increase is primarily due to increased property taxes.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net, decreased $10.7 million during the third quarter of 2009 and $22.9 million for the first nine months of 2009, compared with the same periods in 2008.  The net decline is mainly due to changes in our non-qualified benefit plan liabilities related to market activity, lower interest on under recovered deferred fuel balances and a decrease in interest received from WYCO for construction deposits.
 
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction, Equity and Debt (AFDC) 
AFDC increased by approximately $2.3 million, or 8.8 percent, for the third quarter of 2009, and by $11.0 million, or 14.8 percent, for the first nine months of 2009, compared with the same periods in 2008.  The increase was due primarily to the construction of Comanche Unit 3, a power facility located in Colorado which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2009, as well as other construction projects.
 
Interest Charges 
Interest charges decreased by approximately $0.4 million, or 0.3 percent, for the third quarter of 2009 and increased by $14.8 million, or 3.6 percent, for the first nine months of 2009, compared with the same periods in 2008.  The lower interest expense in the third quarter was largely due to a maturing bond at NSP-Minnesota that was repaid by issuing lower-cost short-term debt.  This short-term debt is expected to be refinanced with long-term debt later in the year.  The year-to-date increase was primarily the result of increased debt levels to fund new capital investments.
 
Income Taxes 
Income tax expense for continuing operations increased by $14.1 million for the third quarter of 2009, compared with 2008.  The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 38.4 percent for the third quarter of 2009, compared with 35.3 percent for the same period in 2008.   Income tax expense for continuing operations increased by $27.8 million for the first nine months of 2009, compared with the first nine months of 2008.  The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 35.8 percent for the first nine months of 2009, compared with 34.4 percent for the same period in 2008.
 
The higher effective tax rates were primarily due to the recognition of additional state unitary tax expense and the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain state tax credit carryovers that are now expected to expire, which was partially offset by wind energy production tax credits.  Excluding these expense items, the effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 would have been 36.4 percent and 34.8 percent, respectively. We expect the effective tax rate for 2009 continuing operations to be approximately 34 percent to 36 percent.
 
Equity Earnings of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries 
Equity earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries increased by $4.0 million for the third quarter of 2009, and by $9.6 million for the first nine months of 2009, compared with the same periods in 2008.  The increase is primarily due to higher earnings from the equity investment in WYCO as a result of the High Plains natural gas pipeline, located in Colorado, commencing operations in late 2008
as well as a storage facility that commenced operations in July 2009.
 
Note 3. Xcel Energy Capital Structure and Financing
 
Following is the capital structure of Xcel Energy at Sept. 30, 2009:
 
Financing Plans
Xcel Energy issues debt securities to refinance retiring maturities, reduce short-term debt, fund construction programs and for other general corporate purposes.
 
NSP-Minnesota plans to issue $300 million of first mortgage bonds in November.  The proceeds will be used to repay short-term debt, which was used to fund the payment of a $250 million unsecured note that matured on Aug. 1, 2009, and for general corporate purposes.
 
Financing plans are subject to change, depending on capital expenditures, internal cash generation, market conditions and other factors.
 
Xcel Energy and Utility Subsidiary Credit Facilities 
As of Oct. 21, 2009, Xcel Energy had the following credit facilities available to meet its liquidity needs:
 
 
(a)
 Includes direct borrowings, outstanding commercial paper and letters of credit.
(b)
 NSP-Wisconsin does not have a separate credit facility; however, it has a short-term borrowing agreement with NSP-Minnesota.
 
Note 5.  Rates and Regulation
 
NSP-Minnesota Electric Rate Case
 
In November 2008, NS
P-Minnesota filed a request with the MPUC to increase Minnesota electric rates by $156 million annually.  This request was later modified to $136 million.
 
In September 2009, the MPUC voted to approve a rate increase of approximately $91.4 million.  As part of its decision, the MPUC approved a 10-year life extension of the Prairie Island nuclear plant for purposes of determining depreciation and decommissioning expenses, effective Jan. 1, 2009. This decision reduced NSP-Minnesota's overall revenue deficiency by approximately $40 million, while at the same time reducing expense accruals by a corresponding amount.  A summary of the key terms is listed below:
 
 
As of Sept. 30, 2009, NSP-Minnesota accrued a customer refund of approximately $30.2 million to reflect the difference between interim rates that were implemented Jan. 2, 2009 and the amount approved by the MPUC.
The written order was issued Oct. 23, 2009.
 
NSP-Minnesota - South Dakota Electric Rate Case
 In June 2009, NSP-Minnesota filed to increase South Dakota electric rates by $18.6 million, or 12.7 percent.  The request is based on a requested ROE of 11.25 percent, an electric rate base of $282 million, an equity ratio of 51.63 percent and a 2008 historic test year, adjusted for known and measurable changes in rate base and O&M expense.  The proposed increase includes approximately $2.9 million in rider revenues; therefore, the requested increase, net of current riders, is approximately $15.7 million or 10.7 percent.  Rates are expected to be effective in January 2010, based on statutory requirements in South Dakota.  The procedural schedule is as follows:
 
                 
Staff and Intervenor Testimony  Nov. 20, 2009;
                 
Testimony  Dec. 4. 2009;
                 
Hearings   Dec. 9  11, 2009.
 
NSP-Wisconsin - Electric and Gas Rate Case
 In June 2009, NSP-Wisconsin filed an electric and gas rate case in Wisconsin seeking an increase in retail electric rates of $30.4 million, or 5.7 percent, and proposed no change in natural gas rates.  The request is based on an ROE of 10.75 percent, an equity ratio of 53.12 percent, an electric rate base of $644 million, a gas rate base of $81 million and a 2010 forecasted test year. The request is comprised of a traditional base rate increase of $45.1 million offset by projected fuel decreases of $14.7 million.
 
On Oct. 21, 2009, Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) staff and intervenors filed testimony.  The PSCW staff recommended an increase of $14.5 million for 2010 based on a 10.75 percent ROE and a 51.63 percent equity ratio.  The staff has proposed to apply the 2009 fuel over recovery against the increase such that there would be no change in rates for 2010.  A summary of the adjusted request is listed below:
 
 
The base non-fuel adjustments include: (1) an adjustment to the equity ratio from 53.12 percent to 51.63 percent on a regulatory basis; (2) a reduction to rate base to account for appropriated retained earnings associated with certain hydro licenses; (3) reduced interchange agreement fixed charge billings and (4) a disallowance of certain employee compensation expenses.  In addition, the PSCW staff adjustments to the proposed increase include a $6.5 million reduction for Prairie Island nuclear plant decommissioning expense as a result of the 10-year life extension approved by the MPUC.
 
The Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group (WIEG) was the only intervenor to file direct testimony.  WIEG objects to NSP-Wisconsin's class cost of service study and proposed rate design, and recommends changes that would benefit its members.
 
A decision is expected by the end of 2009 with new rates in effect in January 2010.  The procedural schedule is as follows:
 
                 
Rebuttal Testimony  Nov. 6, 2009;
                 
Surrebuttal Testimony  Nov. 10, 2009;
                 
Technical & Public Hearing  Nov. 11, 2009.
 
PSCo
-
2010 Electric Rate Case
 In May 2009, PSCo filed a request to increase electric rates in Colorado by $180.2 million, or 6.8 percent.  The rate filing is based on a 2010 forecast test year, 11.25 percent ROE, rate base of $4.4 billion, and an equity ratio of 58.05 percent. Intervenors have filed testimony with the following current recommendations:
 
                 
The CPUC staff has recommended an increase of $70.5 million, based on an adjusted 2008 historic test year (adjusted for Comanche Unit 3 and Fort St. Vrain) and a 9.84 percent ROE.  The main adjustments are related to ROE, elimination of incentive pay, and deferral of recovery of dismantling costs.
                 
The Colorado Office of Consumer Counsel (OCC) has recommended an increase of $33.2 million, based on an adjusted 2008 historic test year (adjusted for Comanche Unit 3 and Fort St. Vrain) and a 9.75 percent ROE.  The main adjustments are related to ROE, a lower equity ratio of 53 percent, a cash working capital cost reduction, unbilled revenue, elimination of incentive pay, lower pension and benefit costs, and no recovery of future Innovative Clean Technology expense.  The OCC recommended an increase of $87.8 million if a forward test year is accepted.
                 
Colorado Energy Consumers recommended an increase of up to $95.4 million, an adjusted 2008 historic test year and an ROE of 10.0 percent. The recommendation should be reduced to reflect adjustments by other intervenors.
                 
CF&I Steel, LP and Climax Molybdenum Co. recommended an increase of up to $98.4 million and an adjusted 2008 historic test year. The recommendation should be reduced to reflect adjustments by other intervenors.
 
In October 2009, PSCo filed rebuttal testimony and revised their request rate increase to $177.4 million and affirmed its requested ROE of 11.25 percent.  The procedural schedule is as follows.
 
 
PSCo expects a decision before year end with new rates effective in January 2010.
Note 6.  Xcel Energy Earnings Guidance
 
Based on current projections, we expect 2009 earnings to be near the mid-point of our guidance range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share.  Key assumptions are detailed below:
 
 
Note 7.  Non-GAAP Reconciliation
 
The following table provides a reconciliation of ongoing earnings to GAAP earnings:
 
 
(a)
                      
Ongoing earnings exclude the impact related to the COLI program. During 2007, Xcel Energy resolved a dispute with the IRS regarding its COLI program. The 2009 and 2008 earnings were not materially affected by the termination of the COLI program and the 2009 impact is primarily related to legal costs associated with company claims against the insurance provider and broker of the COLI policies.
