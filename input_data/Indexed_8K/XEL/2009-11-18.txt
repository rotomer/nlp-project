Item 8.01. Other Events
 
On Nov. 12, 2009, North States Power Company (NSP-Minnesota), a Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc., filed to increase Minnesota gas rates by $16.2 million for 2010, which represents a 2.8 percent overall increase in customer bills.  This request is based on a return on equity of 11 percent, an equity ratio of 52.46 percent and a rate base of $441 million.  NSP-Minnesota also requested an additional increase of $3.45 million, effective Jan. 1, 2011, for recovery of pension funding costs to comply with federal law.
 
Interim rates of $11.1 million are expected to go into effect on Jan. 11, 2010.  A decision is expected in the fall of 2010.
