Item 8.01. Other Events
 
In June 2009, Northern States Power Company, a Wisconsin corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc, (NSP-Wisconsin) filed an electric and gas rate case in Wisconsin seeking an increase in retail electric rates of $30.4 million, or 5.7 percent, and proposed no change in natural gas rates.  The request was based on a 10.75 percent return on equity (ROE), an equity ratio of 53.12 percent, an electric rate base of $644 million, a gas rate base of $81 million and a 2010 forecasted test year.  The request was comprised of a traditional base rate increase of $45.1 million offset by projected fuel decreases of $14.7 million.
 
On Dec. 11, 2009, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) held deliberations and approved an electric rate increase of approximately $6.4 million or 1.2 percent and no change in gas rates, based on a 10.4 percent ROE and a 52.30 percent equity ratio.
 
The PSCW also decided to apply $6.4 million of NSP-Wisconsin's 2009 fuel refund obligation to offset the rate increase such that there will generally be no change to NSP-Wisconsin's overall customer bills in 2010. However, individual customers may see an increase or decrease in their bills based on the new rate design approved by the PSCW.  Lastly, the PSCW approved NSP-Wisconsin's request for a limited rate case reopener in 2011 to update certain costs that are billed to NSP-Wisconsin through the interchange agreement with NSP-Minnesota.
 
The base non-fuel adjustments include: (1) adjustments to the ROE and equity ratio as discussed above; (2) reduced interchange agreement fixed charge billings; (3) a disallowance of certain employee compensation expenses.   In addition, the PSCW adjustments include a $9.1 million reduction for Prairie Island nuclear plant decommissioning expense as a result of the 10-year life extension approved by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission earlier this year.  The PSCW approved NSP-Wisconsin's request to discontinue the practice of reducing rate base and common equity to account for appropriated retained earnings associated with certain hydro licenses.
 
A summary of the proposed adjustments is listed below:
 
 
A written order is expected by the end of 2009 with new rates in effect in January 2010.
