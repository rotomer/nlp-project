Item 8.01. Other Events
 
In November 2009, NSP-Minnesota filed a request with the
Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC)
to increase Minnesota natural gas rates by $16.2 million for 2010, which represents a 2.8 percent overall increase in customer bills.  The overall request sought an additional $3.45 million, effective Jan. 1 2011, for recovery of pension funding costs necessary to comply with federal law.  In December 2009, the MPUC voted to approve an interim rate increase of $11.1 million, subject to refund.  These rates went into effect on Jan. 11, 2010.  The following table provides detail of the original request:
 
 
On May 3, 2010, the Office of Energy Security (OES) filed answer testimony recommending an increase of approximately $1.9 million, including a return on equity of 9.67 percent and an equity ratio of 52.46 percent.  In addition, the OES recommended reductions in test-year operation and maintenance expenses, bad debt expenses and marketing expenses.  The OES also recommended against inclusion of the additional requested increase of $3.45 million for 2011 related to pension funding costs.
 
The Minnesota Office of the Attorney General (OAG) also filed answer testimony on May 3, 2010.  While not providing a complete review of all aspects of our proposed increase, they recommended reductions in our proposed cost of long and short-term debt, operating and maintenance expense and incentive compensation.  The OAG also recommended against inclusion of the additional requested increase of $3.45 million for 2011 related to pension funding costs.
 
Rebuttal testimony will be filed on June 2, 2010.  A MPUC decision in this proceeding is expected in the fourth quarter of 2010.
