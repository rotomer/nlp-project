and, in the case of
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated,
as agent (in such capacity, the "Forward Seller") for an affiliated forward counterparty (the "Forward Counterparty")

.  Such additional shares of common stock will be borrowed and delivered to the Underwriters by the Forward Seller.  In certain instances in which the Forward Seller is unable to borrow and deliver shares of common stock on the terms specified by the parties, Xcel Energy will issue and sell to the Underwriters a number of shares equal to the number of shares that the Forward Seller does not borrow or sell.  The closing of the offering of

Xcel Energy
of a number of shares of its common stock equal to the number of shares of common stock to be borrowed and delivered to the Underwriters by the Forward Seller pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement.  Settlement of the Forward Agreements is expected to occur no later than approximately 10 months following the date of the Underwriting Agreement.  Subject to certain exceptions,
Xcel Energy

Exhibit 1.01
 
 
August 3, 2010
 
 
Dear Sirs,
 
The purpose of this letter agreement (this "Confirmation") is to confirm the terms and conditions of the transaction entered into between us on the Trade Date specified below (this "Transaction").  This Confirmation constitutes a "Confirmation" as referred to in the ISDA Master Agreement specified below.
 
1.
            
The definitions and provisions contained in the 2002 ISDA Equity Derivatives Definitions (the "2002 Definitions"), as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., are incorporated into this Confirmation.  In the event of any inconsistency between the 2002 Definitions and this Confirmation, this Confirmation will govern.
 
This Confirmation evidences a complete and binding agreement between Party A and Party B as to the terms of the Transaction to which this Confirmation relates. This Confirmation shall supplement, form a part of, and be subject to an agreement in the form of the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement (the "Agreement") as if Party A and Party B had executed an agreement in such form on the Trade Date (but without any Schedule except for the election of the laws of the State of New York as the governing law). In the event of any inconsistency between provisions of that Agreement and this Confirmation, this Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of the Transaction to which this Confirmation relates. The parties hereby agree that no Transaction other than the Transaction to which this Confirmation relates shall be governed by the Agreement.  For purposes of the 2002 Definitions, this Transaction is a Share Forward Transaction.
 
Party A and Party B each represents to the other that it has entered into this Transaction in reliance upon such tax, accounting, regulatory, legal, and financial advice as it deems necessary and not upon any view expressed by the other.

The effectiveness of this Confirmation on the Effective Date shall be subject to (i) the condition that the representations and warranties of Party B contained in the Underwriting Agreement dated the date hereof among Party B and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated as the Underwriter named therein (the "Underwriting Agreement") and any certificate delivered pursuant thereto by Party B are true and correct on the Effective Date as if made as of the Effective Date, (ii) the condition that Party B have performed all of the obligations required to be performed by it under the Underwriting Agreement on or prior to the Effective Date, (iii) the condition that Party B have delivered to Party A an opinion of counsel dated as of the Effective Date with respect to matters set forth in Section 3(a) of the Agreement, (iv) the satisfaction of all of the conditions set forth in Section 7 of the Underwriting Agreement and (v) the condition that neither of the following has occurred (A) in Party A's commercially reasonable judgment, Party A (or its Affiliate) is unable to borrow and deliver for sale a number of Shares equal to the Base Amount, or (B) in Party A's commercially reasonable judgment either it is impracticable to do so or Party A (or its Affiliate) would incur a stock loan cost of more than a rate equal to 50 basis points per annum to do so (in which event this Confirmation shall be effective but the Base Amount for this Transaction shall be the number of Shares Party A (or its Affiliate) is required to deliver in accordance with Section 2 of the Underwriting Agreement). 
Party B's obligations hereunder shall be subject to the condition precedent that Party A and each Affiliate of Party A that is a Forward Seller or Underwriter (as such terms are defined in the Underwriting Agreement) shall have performed, on or prior to the Effective Date, all of the obligations required to be performed by it prior to the Effective Date under the Underwriting Agreement.
 
Additional Representations, Warranties and Agreements of Party B
:  Party B hereby represents and warrants to, and agrees with, Party A as of the date hereof that:
 
(a)
  
Any Shares, when issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of this Transaction, will be duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and the issuance thereof will not be subject to any preemptive or similar rights.

All Shares so issuable shall, upon such issuance, be accepted for listing or quotation on the Exchange.
 
(c)
  
Party B agrees to provide Party A at least 30 days' written notice (an "Issuer Repurchase Notice") prior to executing any repurchase of Shares by Party B or any of its subsidiaries (or entering into any contract that would require, or give the option to, Party B or any of its subsidiaries, to purchase or repurchase Shares), whether out of profits or capital or whether the consideration for such repurchase is cash, securities or otherwise (an "Issuer Repurchase"), that alone or in the aggregate would result in the Base Amount Percentage (as defined below) being (i) equal to or greater than 8% of the outstanding Shares or (ii) greater by 0.5% or more than the Base Amount Percentage at the time of the immediately preceding Issuer Repurchase Notice (or in the case of the first such Issuer Repurchase Notice, greater than the Base Amount Percentage as of the later of the date hereof or the immediately preceding Settlement Date, if any).  The "Base Amount Percentage" as of any day is the fraction (1) the numerator of which is the Base Amount and (2) the denominator of which is the number of Shares outstanding on such day.
 
(d)
  
No filing with, or approval, authorization, consent, license registration, qualification, order or decree of, any court or governmental authority or agency, domestic or foreign, is necessary or required for the execution, delivery and performance by Party B of this Confirmation and the
consummation of this Transaction (including, without limitation, the issuance and delivery of Shares on any Settlement Date) except (i) such as have been obtained under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and (ii) as may be required to be obtained under state securities laws.

(h)
  
Party B will not engage in any "distribution" (as defined in Regulation M under the Exchange Act ("Regulation M")) that would cause a "restricted period" (as defined in Regulation M) to occur during any Unwind Period.
 
(i)
   
In addition to any other requirements set forth herein, Party B agrees not to elect Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement if, in the commercially reasonable judgment of either Party A or Party B, such settlement or Party A's related market activity would result in a violation of the U.S. federal securities laws or any other federal or state law or regulation applicable to Party B.
 
(j)
   
Party B (i) has such knowledge and experience in financial and business affairs as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of entering into this Transaction; (ii) has consulted with its own legal, financial, accounting and tax advisors in connection with this Transaction; and (iii) is entering into this Transaction for a bona fide business purpose.

(m)
 
The Pricing Disclosure Package (as defined in the Underwriting Agreement), as of the Applicable Time (as defined in such agreement) did not, and as of the Effective Date will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; that Party B makes no representations or warranties as to the information contained in or omitted from the Pricing Disclosure Package in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to Party B by or on behalf of any Underwriter (as defined in such agreement) through the Representatives (as defined in such agreement) specifically for use in the Pricing Disclosure Package, which information is specified in Section 10(g) of the Underwriting Agreement.

(b)
  
In connection with bids and purchases of Shares in connection with any Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement of this Transaction, Party A shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to conduct its activities, or cause its affiliates to conduct their activities, in a manner consistent with the requirements of the safe harbor provided by Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, as if such provisions were applicable to such purchases.

Extraordinary Dividends
:
 
If an ex-dividend date for an Extraordinary Dividend occurs on or after the Trade Date and on or prior to the Maturity Date (or, if later, the last date on which Shares are delivered by Party B to Party A in settlement of this Transaction), Party B shall pay an amount, as determined by the Calculation Agent, in cash equal to the product of such Extraordinary Dividend and the Base Amount to Party A on the earlier of (i) the date on which such Extraordinary Dividend is paid by the Issuer to holders of record of the Shares or (ii) the Maturity Date.  "Extraordinary Dividend" means the per Share amount of any cash dividend or distribution declared by the Issuer with respect to the Shares that is specified by the board of directors of the Issuer as an "extraordinary" dividend.
 
Acceleration Events

The following events shall each constitute an "Acceleration Event":
 
(a)

(b)
        
Dividends and Other Distributions
.  On any day occurring after the Trade Date Party B declares a distribution, issue or dividend to existing holders of the Shares of (i) any cash dividend (other than an Extraordinary Dividend) to the extent all cash dividends having an ex-dividend date during the period from, and including, any Forward Price Reduction Date (with the Trade Date and the Maturity Date being Forward Price Reduction Dates for purposes of this clause (b) only) to, but excluding, the next subsequent Forward Price Reduction Date exceeds, on a per Share basis, the Forward Price Reduction Amount set forth opposite the first date of any such period on Schedule I or (ii) share capital or securities of another issuer acquired or owned (directly or indirectly) by Party B as a result of a spin-off or other similar transaction or (iii) any other type of securities (other than Shares), rights or warrants or other assets, for payment (cash or other consideration) at less than the prevailing market price as determined by Party A.  To the extent the declaration of a distribution, issue or dividend contemplated by this paragraph (b) would also be considered to be the type of event to which Calculation Agent Adjustment would apply as specified under "Adjustments  Method of Adjustment" above, the provisions of this paragraph (b) will apply and Calculation Agent Adjustment shall not apply;
 
(c)
         
ISDA Early Termination Date
.  Party A has the right to designate an Early Termination Date pursuant to Section 6 of the Agreement;
 
(d)
        
Other ISDA Events

provided
provided further
announcement of the formal or informal interpretation" and (B) immediately following the word "Transaction" in clause (X) thereof, adding the phrase "in the manner contemplated by Party A on the Trade Date" and (ii) any determination as to whether (A) the adoption of or any change in any applicable law or regulation (including, without limitation, any tax law) or (B) the promulgation of or any change in or public announcement of the formal or informal interpretation by any court, tribunal or regulatory authority with competent jurisdiction of any applicable law or regulation (including any action taken by a taxing authority), in each case, constitutes a "Change in Law" shall be made without regard to Section 739 of the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010 or any similar provision in any legislation enacted on or after the Trade Date; or
 
(e)

minus

Termination Settlement
:

If, upon designation of a Termination Settlement Date by Party A pursuant to the preceding sentence, Party B fails to deliver the Settlement Shares relating to such Termination Settlement Date when due or otherwise fails to perform obligations within its control in respect of this Transaction, it shall be an Event of Default with respect to Party B and Section 6 of the Agreement shall apply.If an Acceleration Event occurs during an Unwind Period relating to a number of Settlement Shares to which Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement applies, then on the Termination Settlement Date relating to such Acceleration Event, notwithstanding any election to the contrary by Party B, Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement shall apply to the portion of the Settlement Shares relating to such Unwind Period as to which Party A has unwound its hedge and Physical Settlement shall apply in respect of (x) the remainder (if any) of such Settlement

Private Placement Procedures

It is the intent of Party A and Party B that following any election of Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement by Party B, the purchase of Shares by Party A during any Unwind Period comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1)(i)(B) of the Exchange Act and that this Confirmation shall be interpreted to comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c).
 
Party B acknowledges that (i) during any Unwind Period Party B does not have, and shall not attempt to exercise, any influence over how, when or whether to effect purchases of Shares by Party A (or its agent or affiliate) in connection with this Confirmation and (ii) Party B is entering into the Agreement and this Confirmation in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade compliance with federal securities laws including, without limitation, Rule 10b-5 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

SCHEDULE I
 
 
ANNEX A
 
(i)
                                    
If Party B delivers the Restricted Shares pursuant to this clause (i) (a "Private Placement Settlement"), then delivery of Restricted Shares by Party B shall be effected in customary private placement procedures with respect to such Restricted Shares reasonably acceptable to Party A; that if, on or before the date that a Private Placement Settlement would occur, Party B has taken, or caused to be taken, any action that would make unavailable either the exemption pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for the sale by Party B to Party A (or any affiliate designated by Party A) of the Restricted Shares or the exemption pursuant to Section 4(1) or Section 4(3) of the Securities Act for resales of the Restricted Shares by Party A (or any such affiliate of Party A) or Party B fails to deliver the Restricted Shares when due or otherwise fails to perform obligations within its control in respect of a Private Placement Settlement, it shall be an Event of Default with respect to Party B and Section 6 of the Agreement shall apply.  The Private Placement Settlement of such Restricted Shares shall include customary representations, covenants, blue sky and other governmental filings and/or registrations, indemnities to Party A, due diligence rights (for Party A or any designated buyer of the Restricted Shares by Party A), opinions and certificates, and such other documentation as is customary for private placement agreements, all reasonably acceptable to Party A.  In the case of a Private Placement Settlement, Party A shall, in its good faith discretion, adjust the amount of Restricted Shares to be delivered to Party A hereunder in a commercially reasonable manner to reflect the fact that such Restricted Shares may not be freely returned to securities lenders by Party A and may only be saleable by Party A at a discount to reflect the lack of liquidity in Restricted Shares.  Notwithstanding the Agreement or this Confirmation, the date of delivery of such Restricted Shares shall be the Clearance System Business Day following notice by Party A to Party B of the number of Restricted Shares to be delivered pursuant to this clause (i).  For the avoidance of doubt, delivery of Restricted Shares shall be due as set forth in the previous sentence and not be due on the Settlement Date or Termination Settlement Date that would otherwise be applicable.
provided
 
(ii)
                                 
If Party B delivers any Restricted Shares in respect of this Transaction, Party B agrees that (i) such Shares may be transferred by and among Party A and its affiliates and (ii) after the minimum "holding period" within the meaning of Rule 144(d) under the Securities Act has elapsed after the applicable Settlement Date, Party B shall promptly remove, or cause the transfer agent for the Shares to remove, any legends referring to any transfer restrictions from such Shares upon delivery by Party A (or such affiliate of Party A) to Party B or such transfer agent of seller's and broker's representation letters customarily delivered by Party A or its affiliates in connection with resales of restricted securities pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, each without any further requirement for the delivery of any certificate, consent, agreement, opinion of counsel, notice or any other document, any transfer tax stamps or payment of any other amount or any other action by Party A (or such affiliate of Party A).

The parties hereby agree that no Transaction other than the Transaction to which this Confirmation relates shall be governed by the Agreement.  For purposes of the 2002 Definitions, this Transaction is a Share Forward Transaction.

(a)

All Shares so issuable shall, upon such issuance, be accepted for listing or quotation on the Exchange.
 
(c)
         
Party B agrees to provide Party A at least 30 days' written notice (an "Issuer Repurchase Notice") prior to executing any repurchase of Shares by Party B or any of its subsidiaries (or entering into any contract that would require, or give the option to, Party B or any of its subsidiaries, to purchase or repurchase Shares), whether out of profits or capital or whether the consideration for such repurchase is cash, securities or otherwise (an "Issuer Repurchase"), that alone or in the aggregate would result in the Base Amount Percentage (as defined below) being  (i) equal to or greater than 8% of the outstanding Shares or (ii) greater by 0.5% or more than the Base Amount Percentage at the time of the immediately preceding Issuer Repurchase Notice (or in the case of the first such Issuer Repurchase Notice, greater than the Base Amount Percentage as of the later of the date hereof or the immediately preceding Settlement Date, if any).

(g)

(h)
        
Party B will not engage in any "distribution" (as defined in Regulation M under the Exchange Act ("Regulation M")) that would cause a "restricted period" (as defined in Regulation M) to occur during any Unwind Period.
 
(i)
            
In addition to any other requirements set forth herein, Party B agrees not to elect Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement if, in the commercially reasonable judgment of either Party A or Party B, such settlement or Party A's related market activity would result in a violation of the U.S. federal securities laws or any other federal or state law or regulation applicable to Party B.

(m)
      
The Pricing Disclosure Package (as defined in the Underwriting Agreement), as of the Applicable Time (as defined in such agreement) did not, and as of the Effective Date will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; that Party B makes no representations or warranties as to the information contained in or omitted from the Pricing Disclosure Package in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to Party B by or on behalf of any Underwriter (as defined in such agreement) through the Representatives (as defined in such agreement) specifically for use in the Pricing Disclosure Package, which information is specified in Section 10(g) of the Underwriting Agreement.

The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that (1) at any point prior to any Insolvency Filing in respect of the Issuer, Party B shall have the unilateral right to elect Physical Settlement of this
 
Transaction pursuant to the provisions set forth above under the heading "Settlement Terms"; and (2) this Transaction shall automatically terminate on the date of any Insolvency Filing pursuant to the provisions set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph solely to the extent that Party B failed to elect Physical Settlement of this Transaction pursuant to the provisions set forth above under the heading "Settlement Terms" prior to the relevant Insolvency Filing.

(b)
        
Dividends and Other Distributions
.  On any day occurring after the Trade Date Party B declares a distribution, issue or dividend to existing holders of the Shares of (i) any cash dividend (other than an Extraordinary Dividend) to the extent all cash dividends having an ex-dividend date during the period from, and including, any Forward Price Reduction Date (with the Trade Date and the Maturity Date being Forward Price Reduction Dates for purposes of this clause (b) only) to, but excluding, the next subsequent Forward Price Reduction Date exceeds, on a per Share basis, the Forward Price Reduction Amount set forth opposite the first date of any such period on Schedule I or (ii) share capital or securities of another issuer acquired or owned (directly or indirectly) by Party B as a result of a spin-off or other similar transaction or (iii) any other type of securities (other than Shares), rights or warrants or other assets, for payment (cash or other consideration) at less than the prevailing market price as determined by Party A.

ANNEX A
 
(i)
                                    
If Party B delivers the Restricted Shares pursuant to this clause (i) (a "Private Placement Settlement"), then delivery of Restricted Shares by Party B shall be effected in customary private placement procedures with respect to such Restricted Shares reasonably acceptable to Party A; that if, on or before the date that a Private Placement Settlement would occur, Party B has taken, or caused to be taken, any action that would make unavailable either the exemption pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for the sale by Party B to Party A (or any affiliate designated by Party A) of the Restricted Shares or the exemption pursuant to Section 4(1) or Section 4(3) of the Securities Act for resales of the Restricted Shares by Party A (or any such affiliate of Party A) or Party B fails to deliver the Restricted Shares when due or otherwise fails to perform obligations within its control in respect of a Private Placement Settlement, it shall be an Event of Default with respect to Party B and Section 6 of the Agreement shall apply.

In the case of a Private Placement Settlement, Party A shall, in its good faith discretion, adjust the amount of Restricted Shares to be delivered to Party A hereunder in a commercially reasonable manner to reflect the fact that such Restricted Shares may not be freely returned to securities lenders by Party A and may only be saleable by Party A at a discount to reflect the lack of liquidity in Restricted Shares.  Notwithstanding the Agreement or this Confirmation, the date of delivery of such Restricted Shares shall be the Clearance System Business Day following notice by Party A to Party B of the number of Restricted Shares to be delivered pursuant to this clause (i).  For the avoidance of doubt, delivery of Restricted Shares shall be due as set forth in the previous sentence and not be due on the Settlement Date or Termination Settlement Date that would otherwise be applicable.

Exhibit 5.01
 
Xcel Energy Inc.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I am Vice President and General Counsel of Xcel Energy Inc., a Minnesota corporation (the "Company").  In that capacity, I and the attorneys that I supervise have acted as counsel for the Company with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the Forward Agreement and the Additional Forward Agreement (each as defined below).
 
For the purpose of rendering this opinion letter, I, or attorneys that I supervise, have examined the proceedings taken by the Company with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement dated August 3, 2010 (the "Agreement") between the Company and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Barclays Capital Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., acting as representatives of the several underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement (collectively, the "Underwriters"), including in the case of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as agent for Bank of America, N.A. (the "Forward Counterparty"), in connection with the purchase by the Underwriters of 21,850,000 shares of common stock (the "Borrowed Shares"), par value $2.50 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock").  In connection therewith, the Company and the Forward Counterparty have entered into (a) the confirmation dated August 3, 2010 (the "Forward Agreement") and (b) the confirmation dated August 4, 2010 (the "Additional Forward Agreement"), relating to the forward sale of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Borrowed Shares.
 
I, or attorneys that I supervise, also have participated in the preparation of or examined the registration statement and any amendments thereto and the accompanying prospectuses and any supplements thereto, as filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and any issuer free writing prospectuses, with respect to the Common Stock.  My examination has extended to all statutes, records, instruments, and documents that I have deemed necessary to examine for the purposes of this opinion letter.
 
Based on the foregoing and the assumptions that follow, I am of the opinion that the maximum number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered to the Forward Counterparty pursuant to the Forward Agreement and the Additional Forward Agreement have been duly authorized and reserved for issuance by the Company, and when issued and delivered by the Company to the Forward Counterparty pursuant to the Forward Agreement and the Additional Forward Agreement against payment therefore if required therein, will be fully paid and non-assessable.
 
I express no opinion as to the laws of any other jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of Minnesota and the federal laws of the United States of America.  The opinions herein expressed are limited to the specific issues addressed and to laws existing on the date hereof.  By rendering this opinion letter, I do not undertake to advise you with respect to any other matter or of any change in such laws or in the interpretation thereof that may occur after the date hereof.
 
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as Exhibit 5.01 to the Current Report on Form 8-K dated the date hereof filed by the Company and incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-161521).  In giving such consent, I do not hereby admit that I am included in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder.
