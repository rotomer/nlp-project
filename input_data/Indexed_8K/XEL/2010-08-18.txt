Item 8.01.             Other Events.
 
On Aug. 13, 2010, Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo), a Colorado corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc., filed its preferred plan with the Colorado Public Utility Commission (CPUC) under the recently enacted state Clean Air-Clean Jobs Act. The plan responds to a state law passed last spring that required PSCo to propose reductions in nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 70 to 80 percent by 2017, to meet anticipated federal clean air regulations.
 
PSCo's filing analyzes the costs and emissions reductions of different combinations of emissions controls, unit retirements and switching certain coal-fired units to burn natural gas. PSCo recommended retrofitting certain plants with pollution control equipment, as well as retiring others, and replacing the retired plant capacity with natural gas combined cycle units. PSCo's recommended plan has three key components:
 
                 
Retires 900 megawatts (MW) of coal generation at its Valmont (186 MW) and Cherokee (717 MW) power plants by the end of 2017 and the end of 2022, respectively;
                 
Repowers its Cherokee power plant with efficient, natural gas generation of 883 MW. PSCo also will switch to natural gas generation at the 111 MW Arapahoe unit four; and
                 
Retrofits about 950 MW of coal-fired generation at the Pawnee (505 MW) and Hayden (446 MW) power plants with modern emission control technology.
 
The plan would reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from the targeted plants by 75 percent at the end 2017, and by 89 percent at the end of 2022.  In addition, when compared to 2008 levels, the plan would reduce sulfur dioxide (SO
2
) emissions by 84 percent and mercury emissions by 85 percent for the power plants targeted under the plan by 2023. The plan also allows PSCo to meet Colorado's statewide carbon dioxide reduction goal of 20 percent before the 2020 target.
 
The total cost of the plan, if approved by the CPUC, would result in new electric plant construction of approximately $1.3 billion and natural gas pipeline construction of approximately $110 million over the next 12 years. The rate impact of the proposed plan is expected to increase future bills on average by 1 percent annually over the next ten years. The recommend plan is estimated to cost less than retrofiting all of these units with pollution control equipment. The estimated cost of the plan for the years 2011 through 2017 is shown in the table below:
 
 
PSCo also proposed to implement a new emission reduction adjustment rate to go into effect around Jan. 1, 2011. This adjustment clause seeks to recover a return on the construction work in progress (CWIP) for electric investments made pursuant to the plan and the recovery of other plant related costs, such as higher depreciation expense, incurred under the emissions reduction plan. The 2011 expected increase would be approximately $14.1 million consisting of a CWIP return of $4.7 million and $9.4 million for the first year of a proposed two year amortization of higher costs associated with changes in remaining plant lives.
