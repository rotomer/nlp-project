Item 8.01. Other Events
On Nov. 3, 2010, Northern States Power Company (NSP-Minnesota), a Minnesota corporation, filed a request with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) for an overall increase in annual revenues of approximately $150 million, or an increase of 5.62 percent.  The rate filing is based on a 2011 forecast test year and includes a requested rate of return on equity of 11.25 percent, an electric rate base of approximately $5.6 billion and an equity ratio of 52.56 percent.  NSP-Minnesota requested an additional increase of $48.3 million or 1.81 percent effective Jan. 1, 2012, to address certain known and measurable cost increases in 2012.
As part of this rate filing, NSP-Minnesota proposes to implement interim electricity rates effective Jan. 2, 2011. The interim rate increase, subject to refund, is proposed in the amount of approximately $128 million.  The interim rates would remain in effect until the MPUC makes its final decision on the case. A MPUC decision is anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2011
