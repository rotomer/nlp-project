Item 8.01. Other Events
In August, 2010, Northern States Power Company, a Wisconsin corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc, (NSP-Wisconsin) filed a request with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) to reopen the 2010 rate case and increase retail electric rates for 2011 by $29.1 million, or 5.4 percent, based on a forecast 2011 test year.  As part of the resolution of its 2010 electric rate case, the PSCW allowed NSP-Wisconsin to file an application to reopen the 2010 rate case for the limited purpose of updating electric rates for 2011 to reflect anticipated increases in fixed charges, fuel, and the pension-related components of the interchange agreement.
The requested increase in electric rates is primarily related to production and transmission fixed charges, specifically new investment in cleaner sources of energy and transmission lines to help reliably meet customers' electric needs as well as forecast cost increases for fuel and purchased power.  Partially offsetting these increased costs is a refund of the Wisconsin customers share of excess funds in the Monticello nuclear generating plant external decommissioning fund.  No changes are requested to the capital structure or return on equity authorized by the PSCW in the 2010 base rate case.
On Nov. 5, 2010 the PSCW staff filed their direct testimony recommending an increase of $20.1 million or 3.7 percent.  The major cost components of the requested increase and PSCW staff recommendations are summarized below:
The only other party to file direct testimony was the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group (WIEG).  WIEGs testimony advocates for an alternate class cost allocation and rate design that would reduce the size of the rate increase for large energy consumers.
Rebuttal testimony from all parties will be filed on Nov.12, 2010, and the PSCW will hold technical and public hearings on Nov. 17, 2010.  NSP-Wisconsin has requested that the PSCW approve this application to allow new rates to be effective Jan. 1, 2011.
