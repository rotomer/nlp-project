Item 8.01. Other Events
In August 2010, Xcel Energy entered into equity forward agreements in connection with a public offering of 21.85 million shares of Xcel Energy common stock. Under the equity forward agreements (Forward Agreements), Xcel Energy agreed to issue to the banking counterparty 21.85 million shares of its common stock, including an over allotment of 2.85 million shares.
 
On Nov. 29, 2010, Xcel Energy settled the equity forward instrument agreement by physically delivering the 21.85 million shares of common equity and receiving cash proceeds of $449.8 million.  The forward price used to determine cash proceeds received by Xcel Energy at settlement was calculated based on the August 2010 public offering price of Xcel Energys common stock, adjusted for underwriting fees, as well as a daily adjustment based on the federal funds rate less a spread of 0.50 percent, and a decrease to the per share price to reflect the October 2010 common stock dividend paid on Xcel Energys common stock.
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
