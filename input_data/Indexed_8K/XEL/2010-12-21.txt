Item 8.01. Other Events
Minnesota Electric Rate Case
On Nov. 3, 2010, Northern States Power Company (NSP-Minnesota), a Minnesota corporation, filed a request with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) for an overall increase in annual revenues of approximately $150 million, or 5.62 percent.  The rate filing is based on a 2011 forecast test year and includes a requested return on equity (ROE) of 11.25 percent, an electric rate base of approximately $5.6 billion and an equity ratio of 52.56 percent.  NSP-Minnesota requested an additional increase of $48.3 million, or 1.81 percent, effective Jan. 1, 2012, to address certain known and measurable cost increases in 2012. 
As part of this rate filing, NSP-Minnesota proposed to implement interim electricity rates in the amount of approximately $128 million effective Jan. 2, 2011.  On Dec. 16, 2010, the MPUC approved interim rates effective Jan. 3, 2011 of $123 million, subject to refund.  The decrease is related to changes in NSP-Minnesotas capital structure to be consistent with NSP-Minnesotas final rate proposal and the MPUC approved sale of $17.3 million of transmission assets.    
North Dakota Electric Rate Case
On Dec. 20, 2010, NSP-Minnesota filed a request with the North Dakota Public Service Commission (NDPSC) for an overall increase in annual revenues of approximately $19.8 million, or an increase of 12 percent.  The rate filing is based on a 2011 forecast test year and includes a requested ROE of 11.25 percent, an electric rate base of approximately $328 million and an equity ratio of 52.56 percent.  NSP-Minnesota requested an additional increase of $4.2 million, or 2.6 percent, effective Jan. 1, 2012, to address certain known and measurable cost increases in 2012. 
As part of this rate filing, NSP-Minnesota proposes to implement interim electricity rates of approximately $17.4 million, subject to refund, effective Feb. 19, 2011.  The interim rates would remain in effect until the NDPSC makes its final decision on the case, which is anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2011.
