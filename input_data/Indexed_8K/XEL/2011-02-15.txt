In May 2010, SPS filed an electric rate case in Texas seeking an annual base rate increase of approximately $71.5 million inclusive of franchise fees.  On a net basis, the request seeks to increase customer bills by approximately $53.4 million or 7 percent.  The rate filing is based on a 2009 test year adjusted for known and measurable changes, a requested ROE of 11.35 percent, an electric rate base of $1.031 billion and an equity ratio of 51.0 percent.  The filing with the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) also includes a request to reconcile SPS fuel and purchased power costs for calendar years 2008 and 2009.  As of Dec. 31, 2009, SPS had a fuel cost under-recovery of approximately $3.3 million.
In the fall of 2010, SPS filed an update to the cost of service to reflect the impact on Texas retail rates, primarily resulting from its sale of Lubbock facilities. The total request was reduced to approximately $63.7 million and the net request $47.6 million.
On Feb. 11, 2011, the parties reached an unopposed settlement to resolve all issues in the case.  Effective Feb. 16, 2011 base rates will increase by $39.4 million, of which $16.9 is associated with the transfer of two riders, the Transmission Cost Recovery Factor (TCRF) and Power Cost Recovery Factor into base rates and a $22.5 million traditional base rate increase.  In addition, SPS is allowed to defer up to $2.3 million of pension and benefit costs and $1.6 million of renewable energy credits that had been included in SPSs base rate request.
Effective Jan. 1, 2012, the settlement provides for SPS to increase base rates by $13.1 million and allows SPS to seek an energy efficiency cost recovery factor rider for $2.9 million that if approved would result in an effective rate increase of $16 million.  SPS plans to make its filing for the rider by May 1, 2011 pursuant to a recent PUCT order. In addition, SPS is allowed to track and defer up to $4.3 million of pension and benefit costs above the test year levels as well as $1.6 million of renewable energy credits, as described above.
SPS agreed not to file another rate case until Sept.15, 2012. In addition, SPS cannot file a TCRF until 2013, and if the Company files a TCRF application before the effective date of rates in its next rate case, it must reduce the calculated TCRF revenue requirement by $12.2 million.
Interim rates will become effective on Feb. 16, 2011, pending a final order from the PUCT approving the settlement.  The PUCT is expected to consider the final order during the first half of 2011.
