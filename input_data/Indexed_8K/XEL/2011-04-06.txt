Item 8.01. Other Events
Minnesota Electric Rate Case
filed a request with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) to increase annual electric rates in Minnesota for 2011 by approximately $150 million, or an increase of 5.62 percent.  The rate filing is based on a 2011 forecast test year and included a requested return on equity (ROE) of 11.25 percent, an electric rate base of approximately $5.6 billion and an equity ratio of 52.56 percent.  In January 2011, NSP-Minnesota revised its requested 2011 rate increase to $148.3 million as the result of the sale of certain transmission assets.
In November 2010,
Northern States Power Company (NSP-Minnesota), a Minnesota corporation,
NSP-Minnesota requested an additional increase of $48.3 million or 1.81 percent effective Jan. 1, 2012, to address certain known and measurable cost increases in 2012. The MPUC approved an interim rate increase of $123 million, subject to refund, effective Jan. 2, 2011.  The interim rates remain in effect until the MPUC makes its final decision on the case.  An MPUC decision is anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2011.
On April 5, 2011, intervening parties filed direct testimony proposing modifications to NSP-Minnesotas rate request.  The Minnesota Office of Energy Security (OES) recommended an increase for 2011 of approximately $56.9 million, based on a recommended ROE of 10.53 percent and an equity ratio of 52.56 percent.  The OES recommended several other adjustments, including a $21.5 million decrease in s proposed income tax expense for 2011 and decreases of approximately $12.4 million to s proposed expenses related to employee compensation, health and pension benefits.  The OES also proposed several other reductions to s operating and maintenance budgets as well as rate base totaling approximately $23.5 million including rent expense, certain nuclear outage costs, transmission revenue increases and disallowance of a portion of NSP-Minnesotas investment in the Nobles Wind Project ($1.9 million) in excess of the original  amount included in NSP-Minnesotas filing for approval.

Finally, the OES recommends an additional increase for 2012 of approximately $34 million to address certain known and measurable cost increases in 2012 associated with NSP-Minnesota's nuclear costs.
Other interveners included the Minnesota Office of the Attorney General (OAG), the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce (the Chamber), the Large Industrial Customer Group (XLI) and the Commercial Group.  The OAG recommended changes to s proposed deferral and amortization treatment of nuclear outage expenses and s proposed ratemaking treatment of capitalized retiree medical expenses.  The XLI recommended changes to NSP-Minnesotas proposed ROE and capital structure, as well as a reduction in NSP-Minnesotas recommended depreciation expense.
