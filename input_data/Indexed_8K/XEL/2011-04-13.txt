In December 2010, Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo) a Colorado Corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc., filed a request with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to increase Colorado retail gas rates by $27.5 million, effective in the summer of 2011.  In March 2011, PSCo revised its requested rate increase to $25.6 million.
The request was based on a 2011 forecast test year, a 10.90 percent return on equity (ROE), a rate base of $1.1 billion and an equity ratio of 57.10 percent.  PSCo proposed recovering $23.2 million of test year capital and operating and maintenance (O&M) expenses associated with pipeline integrity costs, plus an amortization of similar costs that have been accumulated and deferred since the last rate case in 2006.  PSCo also proposed removing the earnings on gas in underground storage from base rates.
On April 11, 2011, intervenors filed answer testimony.  The CPUC Staff recommended a rate decrease of approximately $20.1 million, based on the use of an historic test year (HTY), an ROE of 9.375 percent and an equity ratio of 51.82 percent.  The CPUC Staff also recommended certain adjustments to pipeline integrity costs, rate base items and pension and benefits.
 
The Colorado Office of Consumer Counsel (OCC) recommended a rate decrease of approximately $1 million, based on an ROE of 9.0 percent, an equity ratio of 57.20 percent and by reducing cash working capital to reflect adjustments to interest on long-term debt.  The OCC also recommended adjustments to some O&M expenses, use of a HTY and recommended that gas stored underground remain in base rates rather than move to a rider.  The impact of including gas inventory in base rates would reduce PSCos fuel recovery by an additional $9 million.
 
A final decision is expected in the summer of 2011.  The following procedural schedule has been established:
