Item 8.01. Other Events
In November 2010, Northern States Power Company (NSP-Minnesota) filed a request with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) to increase annual electric rates in Minnesota for 2011 by approximately $150 million, or an increase of 5.62 percent.  The rate filing is based on a 2011 forecast test year and included a requested return on equity (ROE) of 11.25 percent, an electric rate base of approximately $5.6 billion and an equity ratio of 52.56 percent.  NSP-Minnesota requested an additional increase of $48.3 million or 1.81 percent effective Jan. 1, 2012, to address certain known and measurable cost increases in 2012.
The MPUC approved an interim rate increase of $123 million, effective Jan. 2, 2011.  The interim rates are subject to refund and will remain in effect until the MPUC makes its final decision on the case.
In May 2011, NSP-Minnesota revised its rate increase request to approximately $126.4 million or 4.7 percent for 2011, largely due to a revised requested ROE of 10.85 percent.  NSP-Minnesota also reduced its requested increase for 2012 to $44.7 million.
In May 2011, as part of surrebuttal testimony the Office of Energy Security (OES) recommended a $58 million  rate increase, based on a 10.37 percent ROE and a $31 million adjustment for income taxes related to bonus depreciation.  The Office of Attorney General (OAG) and the Xcel Large Industrial Group (XLI) recommended a reduction and refund of depreciation reserves and reductions to or elimination of incentive compensation. The OAG recommended to refund the liability associated with retiree medical benefits.
At the hearings in June 2011, NSP-Minnesota resolved differences with the OES on income taxes and sales forecast.  NSP-Minnesota also made an adjustment to bad debt and incentive compensation expense.  As a result of these adjustments, NSP-Minnesota revised its requested rate increase to $122.8 million. The OES revised its recommendation to reflect these same changes to approximately $84.7 million.  The primary difference between the NSP-Minnesota requested rate increase and the OES updated recommendation are associated with the ROE and compensation issues.
Absent a shut down of state government, which would result in a delay, an MPUC decision is expected in the fourth quarter of 2011.  The remaining schedule is listed below:
