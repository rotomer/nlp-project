Item 8.01. Other Events
On June 30, 2011, Northern States Power Company (NSP-Minnesota), a Minnesota corporation, and wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc., filed a request with the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission (SDPUC) to increase South Dakota retail electric rates by $14.6 million annually, effective in 2012.  The proposed increase included approximately $0.7 million in revenues currently recovered through automatic recovery mechanisms.  Net of current automatic recovery mechanisms, the requested increase was approximately $13.9 million.  The request is based on a 2010 historic test year adjusted for known and measurable changes, an 11 percent return on equity (ROE), a rate base of $323.4 million and an equity ratio of 52.48 percent.  NSP-Minnesota also requests approval of a nuclear cost recovery rider to recover the actual investment cost of the Monticello Life Cycle Management and Enhanced Power Uprate Project that are not reflected in the test year.
