On August 22, 2011, the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors of Xcel Energy Inc. (the Company) approved the following compensation actions for Benjamin G.S. Fowke III, upon his election as the Companys Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer on August 24, 2011.
Effective on August 24, 2011, Mr. Fowke will receive a base salary of $1,100,000 per year.
 
Mr. Fowkes total annual incentive opportunity for 2011 under the Companys Executive Annual Incentive Award Plan, as amended and restated on February 17, 2010, will be based on his base salary and target percentage in effect on December 31, 2011.  His target percentage will be increased to 100% of base salary effective August 24, 2011.
 
Mr. Fowkes long-term incentive target percentage will be increased to 335% of his base salary effective August 24, 2011. The Committee granted 52,346 restricted stock units (RSUs) to Mr. Fowke effective August 24, 2011, which represents supplemental grants for nine different equity awards that are currently outstanding.  This grant was made pursuant to the previously announced policy allowing newly promoted executive officers to be eligible to receive a supplemental grant of long-term incentive awards so that their level of long-term incentive is consistent with the length of time served in the new position.
The performance goals for the RSU awards that represent pro rata amounts of the 2009 and 2010 performance-based RSUs and 2009, 2010 and 2011 performance shares are consistent with those previously disclosed in footnotes four through nine of the Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End Table contained in the Companys Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A (File no. 001-03034), filed with the Commission on April 5, 2011.  The remaining grants of RSUs representing the pro rata amounts of the 2011 performance-based RSUs have either an environmental goal or an earnings per share growth goal, and the actual value of each award will range from 0% to 150% of the target level, depending upon actual performance. The performance period for all 2011 awards ends on December 31, 2013. The forfeiture and dividend provisions of the supplemental RSU grants are the same as the currently outstanding awards.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
