Item 8.01. Other Events
Minnesota Electric Rate Case
In November 2010, NSP-Minnesota filed a request with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) to increase annual electric rates in Minnesota for 2011 by approximately $150 million, or an increase of 5.62 percent and an additional increase of $48.3 million, or 1.81 percent in 2012.  The rate filing was based on a 2011 forecast test year and included a requested return on equity (ROE) of 11.25 percent, an electric rate base of approximately $5.6 billion and an equity ratio of 52.56 percent.
The MPUC approved an interim rate increase of $123 million, subject to refund, effective Jan. 2, 2011.  
 
In June 2011, NSP-Minnesota revised its requested rate increase to $122.9 million, reflecting a revised ROE of 10.85 percent and other adjustments.  In August 2011, NSP-Minnesota submitted supplemental testimony, revising its requested rate increase to approximately $122 million for 2011 and a 2012 step increase of approximately $29 million.  The revisions are due to NSP-Minnesotas decision to delay the Monticello nuclear plant extended power uprate (EPU) from the fall of 2011 to the spring 2013 refueling outage.
NSP-Minnesota has recorded a provision for revenue subject to refund of approximately $27 million for the first nine months of 2011.
On Nov. 14, 2011, NSP-Minnesota filed a settlement agreement of revenue requirement issues and requested the MPUC approve a rate increase of approximately $58.0 million in 2011 and an incremental $14.8 million in 2012 based on an ROE of 10.37 percent.  The settlement agreement also included a reduction to depreciation expense and NSP-Minnesotas rate request by $30 million with an additional adjustment of $7.5 million related to employee compensation.  The settlement also provides NSP-Minnesota the ability to seek deferred accounting for incremental property tax increases associated with electric and natural gas businesses in 2012, which is currently projected to increase by approximately $17 million.  NSP-Minnesota also agreed to not file an electric rate case prior to Nov. 1, 2012, provided that both the settlement and the deferred tax filing are approved by the MPUC. 
The settlement agreement was signed by the NSP-Minnesota, the Xcel Large Industrials, the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, the Commercial Group and Verso Paper Corp. and settles all financial issues and several rate design issues between the signing parties.
The following table presents a summary of the NSP-Minnesota requested 2011 rate increase:
 
NSP-Minnesota requested that the Administrative Law Judge schedule a settlement conference and certify the agreement for MPUC consideration.  Signing parties will file briefs in support of the settlement agreement and addressing remaining rate design issues.
 
 
 
The remaining schedule includes:
   Initial briefs due Nov. 18, 2011; and
   Reply briefs due Dec. 16, 2011.
The MPUC decision is expected in the first quarter of 2012.
