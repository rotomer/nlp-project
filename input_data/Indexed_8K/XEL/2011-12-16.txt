Item 8.01. Other Events
In June 2011, Northern States Power Company, a Wisconsin corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc, (NSP-Wisconsin) filed a request with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) to increase electric rates approximately $29.2 million, or 5.1 percent and natural gas rates approximately $8.0 million, or 6.6 percent effective Jan. 1, 2012. The rate filing was based on a 2012 forecast test year, a requested return on equity (ROE) of 10.75 percent, an equity ratio of 52.54 percent, an electric rate base of approximately $718 million and a natural gas rate base of approximately $84 million.
In October 2011, the PSCW Staff filed testimony and recommended an electric rate increase of $18.1 million and a natural gas rate increase of $2.9 million, based on an ROE of 10.3 percent.
NSP-Wisconsin subsequently reduced its electric rate request to approximately $17.7 million and its gas rate request to approximately $7.3 million. The primary reasons for the reductions were updated 2012 electric fuel costs, rescheduling of the extended power uprate project at the Monticello nuclear plant to 2013, and other miscellaneous cost reductions.
On Dec. 8, 2011, the PSCW approved an electric rate increase of approximately $12.2 million or 2.1 percent and $2.9 million natural gas rate increase or 2.4 percent. The rate increases are based on a 10.4 percent ROE and an equity ratio of 52.59 percent.
The primary reason for the natural gas rate reduction from the original request is the PSCW decision to deny NSP-Wisconsins proposal to pre-collect certain manufactured gas plant remediation costs.
NSP-Wisconsin anticipates a final written order in the fourth quarter of 2011 with new rates effective Jan. 1, 2012.
