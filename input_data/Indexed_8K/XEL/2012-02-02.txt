Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.01
 
MINNEAPOLIS  Xcel Energy Inc. (NYSE: XEL) today reported 2011 GAAP earnings of $841 million, or $1.72 per share compared with 2010 GAAP earnings of $756 million, or $1.62 per share.
Ongoing earnings for 2011, which exclude adjustments for certain items, were $1.72 per share compared with $1.62 per share in 2010.  Ongoing earnings increased primarily due to higher electric margins as a result of warmer than normal summer weather across our service territories and rate increases in various states.   The higher margins were partially offset by expected increases in operating and maintenance expenses, depreciation, interest expense and property taxes.  The increase in expenses was largely driven by capital investment in Xcel Energys utility business.
We had an excellent year in 2011, said Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  We delivered earnings in the upper half of our guidance range, which represents the seventh consecutive year in which we have met or exceeded our earnings guidance.  We exceeded our energy efficiency and conservation program targets.  In addition, we provided excellent customer service and reliability despite severe weather across our service territory during the latter half of the year.  Finally, the recent decision by the D.C. Circuit to stay the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule will provide us more time to comply with the rule in a cost-effective manner in Texas, preventing our customers from being burdened by significant cost increases and avoid potential reliability concerns.
 While it is early in the year, we are facing headwinds in 2012.  The decision by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to deny our request for interim rates will increase regulatory lag in Colorado, although the impact will be partially offset by the CPUCs approval of deferred accounting for a portion of our interim rate request.  In addition, we are experiencing sluggish electric and natural gas sales, warmer than normal winter weather and higher than anticipated property taxes.  However, we are committed to achieving our earnings guidance range and we have implemented cost reductions to help offset the impact of these negative factors.  As a result, we expect 2012 earnings per share to be in the lower half of our $1.75 to $1.85 guidance range, stated Fowke.
Earnings Adjusted for Certain Items (Ongoing Earnings)
 
The following table provides a reconciliation of ongoing earnings per share to GAAP earnings per share:

Due to the seasonality of Xcel Energys operating results, quarterly financial results are not an appropriate base from which to project annual results.
The only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of Xcel Energy Inc.  The earnings and earnings per share (EPS) of each subsidiary discussed below do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to such subsidiary but rather represent a direct interest in our assets and liabilities as a whole.  EPS by subsidiary is a financial measure not recognized under GAAP that is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to the controlling interest of each subsidiary by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period.  We use this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate and provide details of earnings results.  We believe that this measurement is useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of our subsidiaries.  This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to our consolidated fully diluted EPS determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.
Note 1.  Earnings Per Share Summary
The following table summarizes the diluted earnings per share for Xcel Energy:
 
 
PSCo earnings decreased $0.04 per share for 2011. The decrease is due to the implementation of seasonal rates in June 2010 (seasonal rates are higher in the summer months and lower throughout the other months of the year), higher operating and maintenance (O&M) expenses, depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by the favorable impact of warmer temperatures in the summer.
PSCo
NSP-Minnesota earnings increased $0.13 per share for 2011.   The increase is primarily due to higher interim electric rates effective in early 2011, subject to refund, in Minnesota and North Dakota, and conservation program incentives partially offset by higher O&M expenses, depreciation expense (net of regulatory adjustments) and property taxes.
NSP-Minnesota
SPS earnings increased $0.01 per share for 2011.  The increase is due to higher electric revenues, primarily due to the Texas retail rate increase effective in the first quarter of 2011, and warmer summer weather, partially offset by higher O&M expenses, depreciation expense and property taxes.
SPS
NSP-Wisconsin
NSP-Wisconsin earnings increased $0.01 per share for 2011.   The increase is primarily due to higher electric rates, partially offset by higher O&M expenses and depreciation expense.

The following table summarizes significant components contributing to the changes in the 2011 diluted EPS compared with the same periods in 2010, which is discussed in more detail later in the release.
 
Note 2.  Regulated Utility Results  Continuing Operations
Unseasonably hot summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales while, conversely, mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales.  The estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances and the amount of natural gas or electricity the average customer historically uses per degree of temperature.  Accordingly, deviations in weather from normal levels can affect Xcel Energys financial performance.
Estimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings 
Degree-day or Temperature-Humidity Index (THI) data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperature levels based on each days average temperature and humidity.  Heating degree-days (HDD) is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature falls below 65 Fahrenheit, and cooling degree-days (CDD) is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature rises above 65 Fahrenheit.  Each degree of temperature above 65 Fahrenheit is counted as one cooling degree-day, and each degree of temperature below 65 Fahrenheit is counted as one heating degree-day.  In Xcel Energys more humid service territories, a THI is used in place of CDD, which adds a humidity factor to CDD.  HDD, CDD and THI are most likely to impact the usage of Xcel Energys residential and commercial customers.  Industrial customers are less weather sensitive.
Normal weather conditions are defined as either the 20-year or 30-year average of actual historical weather conditions.  The historical period of time used in the calculation of normal weather differs by jurisdiction based on the time period used by the regulator in establishing estimated volumes in the rate setting process.
The percentage increase (decrease) in normal and actual HDD, CDD and THI are as follows:

 Electric revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses are largely impacted by the fluctuation in the price of natural gas, coal and uranium used in the generation of electricity, but as a result of the design of fuel recovery mechanisms to recover current expenses, these price fluctuations have little impact on electric margin.  The following table details the electric revenues and margin:

The following table summarizes the components of the changes in electric margin:
 
 The cost of natural gas tends to vary with changing sales requirements and the cost of natural gas purchases.  However, due to the design of purchased natural gas cost recovery mechanisms to recover current expenses for sales to retail customers, fluctuations in the cost of natural gas have little effect on natural gas margin.  The following table details natural gas revenues and margin:

 O&M expenses increased $15.1 million, or 2.8 percent, for the fourth quarter and $83.0 million, or 4.0 percent for 2011 compared with 2010.  The following table summarizes the changes in O&M expenses:
O&M Expenses
 
Conservation and demand side management (DSM) program expenses increased $3.9 million, or 6.0 percent for the fourth quarter and $41.6 million, or 17.3 percent for 2011, compared with 2010.  The higher expense is primarily attributable to an increase in the rider rates used to recover the program expenses.  Conservation and DSM program expenses are generally recovered in our major jurisdictions concurrently through riders and base rates.
Conservation and DSM Program Expenses 
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $25.3 million, or 11.5 percent for the fourth quarter. This decrease is primarily due to NSP-Minnesota reducing depreciation expense by approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 to reflect the proposed settlement in the Minnesota electric rate case.  This was partially offset by several capital projects, including a portion of the Monticello extended power uprate going into service in May 2011, the Nobles wind project commencing commercial operations in late 2010, the acquisition of two PSCo gas generation facilities in December 2010, Jones Unit 3 going into service in June 2011 and normal system expansion.
Depreciation and Amortization 
Depreciation and amortization expense increased $31.7 million, or 3.7 percent for 2011, compared with 2010.  This increase in depreciation expense is primarily due to several capital projects going into service, including those discussed above, partially offset by the provision for revenue, subject to refund.
Taxes (other than income taxes) increased $9.0 million, or 10.3 percent for the fourth quarter and $42.9 million, or 12.9 percent for 2011, compared with 2010.  The change is primarily due to an increase in 2011 for property taxes of approximately $29.6 million in Colorado and $8.8 million in Minnesota.
Taxes (Other Than Income Taxes) 
Other income, net decreased $21.9 million for 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to the corporate owned life insurance (COLI) settlement in July 2010.
Other Income, Net 
AFUDC decreased $5.3 million, or 21.7 percent for the fourth quarter and $5.4 million, or 6.4 percent for 2011, compared with 2010.  The decrease is primarily due to lower AFUDC rates and lower average construction work in progress.  The lower average construction work in progress is attributed to Comanche Unit 3 and the Nobles wind project going into service in 2010, offset by Monticello extended power uprate and work at the Jones plant, as well as SPS transmission projects in 2011.
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction, Equity and Debt (AFUDC) 
Interest charges increased $5.2 million, or 3.6 percent for the fourth quarter and $13.8 million, or 2.4 percent for 2011, compared with 2010.  The increase is due to higher long-term debt levels necessary to fund investments in utility operations, partially offset by lower interest rates.
Interest Charges 
Income tax expense for continuing operations increased $6.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with the same period in 2010.  The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to an increase in pretax income in 2011.  The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 35.8 percent for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with 34.4 percent for the same period in 2010.  The lower effective tax rate for 2010 was primarily due to a higher level of research credits.
Income Taxes

Income tax expense for continuing operations increased $31.7 million for 2011 compared with 2010.  The increase is primarily due to higher pretax income, a net change in tax valuation allowances of $8.9 million, and the non-taxability of the Provident settlement in 2010.  These were partially offset by the 2010 write-off of the tax benefit for Medicare Part D subsidies, an adjustment related to COLI (see Note 6), and an increase in 2011 wind production tax credits.  The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 35.8 percent for 2011 compared with 36.7 percent for 2010.  The higher effective tax rate for 2010 was primarily due to the Medicare Part D, COLI, and the valuation allowance adjustments referenced above.  Without these adjustments, the effective tax rate for continuing operations for 2010 would have been 35.1 percent.
Xcel Energy Inc. redeemed all series of its preferred stock on Oct. 31, 2011, at an aggregate purchase price of $108 million, plus accrued dividends.  As such, the redemption premium of $3.3 million and accrued dividends are reflected as reductions to earnings available to common shareholders for 2011.

Note 4.  Rates and Regulation
 In November 2010, NSP-Minnesota filed a request with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) to increase electric rates in Minnesota for 2011 by approximately $150 million, or an increase of 5.62 percent and an additional increase of $48.3 million, or 1.81 percent in 2012.  The rate filing was based on a 2011 forecast test year and included a requested return on equity (ROE) of 11.25 percent, an electric rate base of approximately $5.6 billion and an equity ratio of 52.56 percent.  The MPUC approved an interim rate increase of $123 million, subject to refund, effective Jan. 2, 2011.
NSP-Minnesota  Minnesota Electric Rate Case
 
In June 2011, NSP-Minnesota revised its requested rate increase to $122.8 million, reflecting a revised ROE of 10.85 percent and other adjustments.  The Division of Energy Resources (DOER) revised its recommended rate increase to approximately $84.7 million in 2011 and an additional rate increase of $34 million in 2012, reflecting an ROE of 10.37 percent.  The primary differences between the NSP-Minnesota requested rate increase and the DOER updated recommendation were associated with ROE and compensation related issues.
In August 2011, NSP-Minnesota submitted supplemental testimony, revising its requested rate increase to approximately $122 million for 2011 and a 2012 step increase of approximately $29 million.  The revisions were due to delays in the Monticello nuclear plant extended power uprate.
In November 2011, NSP-Minnesota reached a settlement agreement with the Xcel Large Industrials, the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, the Commercial Group and Verso Paper Corp., which settled all financial issues and several rate design issues between the signing parties.  The settlement includes a rate increase of approximately $58.0 million in 2011 and an incremental rate increase of $14.8 million in 2012 based on an ROE of 10.37 percent. The settlement agreement reflects a reduction to depreciation expense and NSP-Minnesotas rate request by $30 million with an additional adjustment of $7.5 million related to employee compensation.  The settlement also provided NSP-Minnesota the ability to seek deferred accounting for incremental property tax increases associated with electric and natural gas businesses in 2012, which is currently projected to increase by approximately $28 million.  NSP-Minnesota also agreed to not file an electric rate case prior to Nov. 1, 2012, provided that both the settlement and the property tax filing are approved by the MPUC.
NSP-Minnesota has recorded a provision for revenue subject to refund of approximately $67.4 million for 2011.  The MPUC is expected to rule on the settlement in the first quarter of 2012.
In December 2010, NSP-Minnesota filed a request with the North Dakota Public Service Commission (NDPSC) to increase 2011 electric rates in North Dakota by approximately $19.8 million, or an increase of 12 percent in 2011 and a step increase of $4.2 million, or 2.6 percent in 2012.  The rate filing is based on a 2011 forecast test year and includes a requested ROE of 11.25 percent, an electric rate base of approximately $328 million and an equity ratio of 52.56 percent.
NSP-Minnesota  North Dakota Electric Rate Case
The NDPSC approved an interim rate increase of approximately $17.4 million, subject to refund, effective Feb. 18, 2011.  The interim rates will remain in effect until the NDPSC makes its final decision on the case.
In May 2011, NSP-Minnesota revised its rate request to approximately $18.0 million, or an increase of 11 percent, for 2011 and $2.4 million, or 1.4 percent, for the additional step increase in 2012, due to the termination of the Merricourt wind project.
In September 2011, NSP-Minnesota reached a settlement with the NDPSC Advocacy Staff.  If approved by the NDPSC, the settlement would result in a rate increase of $13.7 million in 2011 and an additional step increase of $2.0 million in 2012, based on a 10.4 percent ROE and black box settlement for all other issues.  To address 2011 sales coming in below test year projections, the settlement includes a true-up to 2012 non-fuel revenues plus the settlement rate increase.
An NDPSC decision is expected in March 2012.
In June 2011, NSP-Minnesota filed a request with the South Dakota Public Utility Commission (SDPUC) to increase South Dakota electric rates by $14.6 million annually, effective in 2012.  The proposed increase included $0.7 million in revenues currently recovered through automatic recovery mechanisms.  The request is based on a 2010 historic test year adjusted for known and measurable changes, a requested ROE of 11 percent, a rate base of $323.4 million and an equity ratio of 52.48 percent.  NSP-Minnesota also requested approval of a nuclear cost recovery rider to recover the actual investment cost of the Monticello nuclear plant life cycle management and extended power uprate project that is not reflected in the test year.
NSP-Minnesota  South Dakota Electric Rate Case
 
 
As a result of delays in the rate case process, interim rates of $12.7 million were implemented Jan. 2, 2012.  A final decision is expected in the first half of 2012.

 ,n. 1, 2012.  
NSP-Wisconsin 2011 Electric and Gas Rate Case
In June 2011
NSP-Wisconsin filed a request with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) to increase electric rates approximately $29.2 million, or 5.1 percent and natural gas rates approximately $8.0 million, or 6.6 percent effective Ja
The rate filing is based on a 2012 forecast test year and includes a requested ROE of 10.75 percent, an equity ratio of 52.54 percent, an electric rate base of approximately $718 million and a natural gas rate base of $84 million.
In December 2011, the PSCW approved an electric rate increase of approximately $12.2 million or 2.1 percent, and a natural gas rate increase of $2.9 million or 2.4 percent, with new rates effective Jan. 1, 2012.  The primary reason for the natural gas rate reduction from the original request was the PSCW decision to deny NSP-Wisconsins proposal to pre-collect certain manufactured gas plant remediation costs.  The primary reasons for the electric rate reduction were updated 2012 electric fuel costs and the delays in the Monticello nuclear plant life cycle management and extended power uprate project.  The rate increases were based on a 10.4 percent ROE and an equity ratio of 52.59 percent.
In February 2011, SPS filed a request with the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC) seeking to increase New Mexico electric rates approximately $19.9 million.  The rate filing was based on a 2011 test year adjusted for known and measurable changes for 2012, a requested ROE of 11.25 percent, an electric rate base of $390.3 million and an equity ratio of 51.11 percent.
SPS  New Mexico Retail Rate Case 
In December 2011, the NMPRC approved the black box settlement with new rates effective Jan. 1, 2012.  The settlement increased base rates by $13.5 million.  SPS agreed not to file another base rate case until Dec. 3, 2012 with new final rates from the result of such case not going into effect until Jan. 1, 2014 (Settlement Period).  However, SPS can request to implement interim rates if the NMPRC standard for interim rates is met.  During the Settlement Period, rates are to remain fixed aside from the continued operation of the fuel adjustment clause and certain exceptions for energy efficiency, a rider for an approved renewable portfolio standard regulatory asset, and actual costs incurred for environmental regulations with an effective date after Dec. 31, 2010.
 In February 2011, PSCo filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to change Colorado wholesale electric rates to formula based rates with an expected annual increase of $16.1 million for 2011.  The request was based on a 2011 forecast test year, a 10.9 percent ROE, a rate base of $407.4 million and an equity ratio of 57.1 percent.  The formula rate would be estimated each year for the following year and then trued-up to actual costs after the conclusion of the calendar year.  A decision is expected in the first quarter of 2012.
PSCo Wholesale Electric Rate Case
 In December 2010, PSCo filed a request with the CPUC to increase Colorado retail gas rates by $27.5 million on an annual basis.  In March 2011, PSCo revised its requested rate increase to $25.6 million. The revised request was based on a 2011 forecast test year, a 10.9 percent ROE, a rate base of $1.1 billion and an equity ratio of 57.1 percent.  PSCo proposed recovering $23.2 million of test year capital and O&M expenses associated with several pipeline integrity costs plus an amortization of similar costs that have been accumulated and deferred since the last rate case in 2006.  PSCo also proposed removing the earnings on gas in underground storage from base rates.
PSCo 2010 Gas Rate Case
In August 2011, the CPUC approved a comprehensive settlement that PSCo reached with the CPUC Staff and the Colorado Office of Consumer Counsel (OCC) to increase rates by $12.8 million, to institute the pipeline system integrity adjustment (PSIA) rider for recovery of future pipeline integrity costs and to remove gas in underground storage from base rates and recover those costs in the Gas Cost Adjustment (GCA).  The GCA is expected to recover another $10 million of annual incremental revenue, subject to adjustment to actual costs.  Rates were set on a test year ending June 30, 2011 with an equity ratio of 56 percent and an ROE of 10.1 percent.
New base rates and the GCA recovery went into effect in September 2011.  The PSIA rider and new rate designs went into effect on Jan. 1, 2012.
 
 
13
 
In November 2011, PSCo filed a request with the CPUC to increase Colorado retail electric rates by $141.9 million.  The request was based on a 2012 forecast test year, a 10.75 percent ROE, a rate base of $5.4 billion and an equity ratio of 56 percent.  Final rates are expected to be effective in the summer of 2012.The CPUC is expected to rule on the electric rate case in July 2012.
PSCo 2011 Electric Rate Case
 
 
In November 2011, PSCo filed a petition to implement interim rates, subject to refund, of $100 million to be effective in January 2012.  On Jan. 11, 2012, the CPUC denied PSCos request to implement an interim electric rate increase of $100 million on the basis that it had not demonstrated adverse financial impacts.  On Jan. 12, 2012, PSCo filed for reconsideration of the CPUCs decision to deny interim rates, and requested that the CPUC authorize interim rates of approximately $42 million, specifically related to the impacts resulting from the expiration of the Black Hills contract.  On Jan. 17, 2012, the CPUC denied the request for reconsideration.  However, on Jan. 27, 2012, the CPUC approved PSCos request for deferred accounting of the $42 million revenue requirement associated with the Black Hills contract.
 
Note 5.  Xcel Energy Ongoing Earnings Guidance
Xcel Energy expects its 2012 ongoing earnings will be in the lower half of the guidance range of $1.75 to $1.85 per share.  Key assumptions related to ongoing earnings are detailed below:
Note 6.  Non-GAAP Reconciliation
Xcel Energys management believes that ongoing earnings provide a meaningful comparison of earnings results and is representative of Xcel Energys fundamental core earnings power.  Xcel Energys management uses ongoing earnings internally for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, in determining whether performance targets are met for performance-based compensation, and when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors.
The following table provides a reconciliation of ongoing earnings to GAAP earnings:
 
Ongoing earnings exclude the impact of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax and interest adjustments related to the COLI program, the write-off of previously recognized tax benefits relating to Medicare Part D subsidies due to the enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a settlement related to the previously discontinued COLI program.
 
14
 
 
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed into law.  The law includes provisions to generate tax revenue to help offset the cost of the new legislation.  One of these provisions reduces the deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received by plan sponsors that provide retiree prescription drug benefits equivalent to Medicare Part D coverage, beginning in 2013.  Based on this provision, Xcel Energy is subject to additional taxes and is required to reverse previously recorded tax benefits in the period of enactment.  Xcel Energy expensed approximately $17 million, or $0.04 per share, of previously recognized tax benefits relating to Medicare Part D subsidies during the first quarter of 2010.  Xcel Energy does not expect the $17 million of additional tax expense to recur in future periods.

During 2007, Xcel Energy Inc. and PSCo reached a settlement with the IRS related to a dispute associated with its COLI program.  These COLI policies were owned and managed by P.S.R. Investments, Inc. (PSRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of PSCo.  As a follow on to the 2007 IRS COLI settlement, as part of the Tax Court proceedings, during the first quarter of 2010, Xcel Energy Inc., PSCo and the IRS reached an agreement in principle after a comprehensive financial reconciliation of Xcel Energy Inc.'s and PSCos statements of account, dating back to tax year 1993.  Upon completion of this review, PSRI recorded a net non-recurring tax and interest charge of approximately $10 million (including $7.7 million tax expense and $2.3 million interest expense, net of tax), or $0.02 per share during the first quarter of 2010.  During the third quarter of 2010, Xcel Energy Inc. and the IRS came to final agreement on the applicable interest netting computations related to these tax years.  Accordingly, PSRI recorded a reduction to expense of $0.6 million, net of tax, during the third quarter of 2010.  The Tax Court proceedings were dismissed in December 2010 and January 2011.  Upon final cash settlement in fourth quarter 2011, Xcel Energy received $0.7 million and recognized a further reduction of expense of $0.3 million (including $0.4 million tax benefit and $0.1 million interest expense, net of tax).  A closing agreement covering tax years 2003 through 2007 was finalized with the IRS in January 2012.

Under the terms of the settlement, Xcel Energy Inc., PSCo and PSRI were paid $25 million by Provident and Reassure America Life Insurance Company resulting in approximately $0.05 of non-recurring earnings per share in the third quarter of 2010.
