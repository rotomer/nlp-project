Item 8.01. Other Events
On June 29, 2012, Northern States Power Company (NSP-Minnesota), a Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc., filed a request with the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission (SDPUC) to increase South Dakota electric rates by $19.4 million annually.  The request was based on a 2011 historic test year adjusted for certain known and measurable changes for 2012 and 2013, a requested return on equity of 10.65 percent, an average rate base of $367.5 million, and an equity ratio of 52.89 percent.  An SDPUC decision is expected in late 2012 or early 2013.
